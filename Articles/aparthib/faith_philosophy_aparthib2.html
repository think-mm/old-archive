  <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/8808">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/8808</a>&nbsp;
  <a href="http://www.bangladesh-web.com/news/nov/26/g26112002.htm#A5">http://www.bangladesh-web.com/news/nov/26/g26112002.htm#A5</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The definitions of <b>faith</b>, <b>philosophy</b> and <b>dogma</b> as
  cited by S.H from The American Heritage Dictionary is essentialy the same as
  the ones I gave in my article that was referred to. So I am confused as to
  what would it serve to compare my defns with those of The American Heritage
  Dictionary. Nonscientific terms of social issues need not be nor can be
  defined in an exact way. No two philosophers would define these notions in
  identical words or expressions. In fact the definitions in American Heritage
  Dictionary (AHD) differ more from Merriam Webster's dictionary (MWD) than from
  my definitions. (One can look up MWD at <a href="http://www.m-w.com/netdict.htmup">http://www.m-w.com/netdict.htmup</a>&nbsp;
  to verify, I am not citing them here). It will not serve much purpose to
  compare the definitions of MWD with those of AHD. Dictionaries are quick and
  easy way to get the general meaning of any word used in a given context. It is
  not the authoritative guide or standard to settle philosophical notions or to
  gain insight into such notions in any discussion. Definitions cannot alter
  principles or facts of reality. One cannot discover new facts of reality or
  disprove any view of reality solely through redefining words. Definitions can
  change, the objects of definition should not, they are the invariants. Like
  alternate routes to a mountain peak (the invariant), alternate definitions are
  acceptable as long as they all lead to a consistent and exhaustive
  categorization of the objective facts of reality. Anyway let me address some
  of the remarks in S.H's article in random order, starting with the last part
  on relativity.</p>
  <p>The assertion that &quot;everything&quot; is relative is vacuous. As
  philospher Hillary Putnam of Harvard said &quot;if everything is relative,
  then so is the assertion that everything is relative&quot;. It is a self
  defeating statement. Citing Enstein's theory of relativity to make such a
  general statement reflects popular misunderstanding of the technical aspects
  of Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein's theory is really not about
  relativity, but about invariance. In fact Einstein himself did not call his
  theory, a theory of relativity, but a principle of the invariance of the laws
  of physics with respect to changes in frames of refernece. Special relativity
  results from the invariance of the laws of phyisic relative to non-accelerated
  frames of reference and the general theory results from invariance relative to
  accelerated frames. The claim that Marxism is science, not a dogma is quite a
  novel one. The chain of reasoning to make that claim was that &quot;Marxism is
  not a dogma, because Marxism envisages change and gradual evolution. And and
  hence Marxism is also science&quot;. This reasoning is based on
  misinterpretaing both the notion of dogma and science. First of all even if
  Marxism was not a dogma, it does not have to be science just becasue of that,
  that would be a fallacy of false dichotomy. Marxism IS a dogma. It
  authoritatively affirms its goal (i.e classless society, abolition of private
  property etc) as the only acceptable and the RIGHT one. And it stipulates
  force to implement this goal. It has fixated goal. It does not admit of any
  change regarding this goal. All these are hallmarks of a dogma. In fact it
  meets one definition of dogma as given in MWD: &quot;something held as an
  established opinion; especially : a definite authoritative tenet&quot;.
  Granted, Marxism envisages stages that the revolution has to go through stages
  to arrive at the goal. But that view is a strategic one, not a principled one.
  Religious dogma (at least their apologists) also envisages gradual changes to
  bring the world under religion in phases. But both the religious dogma and
  communist dogma are uncompromising about their stated goal being the only
  right one. That certainly sounds like a dogma. Arguing that &quot;Mine is the
  only right one&quot; is not the same as &quot;Mine is the absolute truth&quot;
  is a pedantic one, verging on sophistry. The notion of dogma does not split
  such hairs in its definition. The two most important attribute of dogma as I
  had stated viz.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>(1) Affirmation of its doctrine as the only right one&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p><b>(2) Exercise of force to imoplement it, are both satisfied by
  communism.&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p>It is a great stretch to call Marxism a science. Science does not make such
  affirmation of idealist doctrines, nor envisages the doctrine as the terminal
  one, unlike communism. Science is truly about change and evolution, depending
  on objective evidence and observations, communism does not. Science strives to
  take a third person perspective on reality, communism and religion a first
  person perspective. If change was part of communist doctrine, then communist
  apologists would have viewed the present market economy in China as a more
  improved stage of communism, or would have viewed view the former Soviet Union
  as an evolved stage of communism. Rather they condemned it as revisionism. So
  the claim that communism admits of change, or mandates change is a
  contradiction. Economy is a chaotic system. It is a far from equilibrium
  system, that is very susceptible to socio- cultural factors. It is governed by
  nonlinear laws. No formal theory can be given to achieve the optimum solution
  that will be best for a society for all times. The optimal solution has to be
  an evolutionary one (i.e working through selection pressure) and based on
  accountability and checks and balances, as guaranteed through democracy. This
  can be illustrated with a parable as Nobel laureate Physicist Steven Weinberg
  did in his book &quot;Facing UP', p-254, (in &quot; The The Best and Brightest
  Utopia&quot; section) :</p>
  <pre>
    [ W.S. Gilbert proposed an admirably simple solution to 
      this problem. In the Savoy opera Utopia Limited, the
      King exercises all power but is in constant danger of
      being turned over to the Public Exploder by two Wise
      men, who explain,
       
       Our duty is to spy
          Upon our King's illicities,
       And keep a watchful eye
          On all his eccentricities.
       If ever a trick he tries
          That savours of rascality,
       At our decree he dies
         Without the least formality
            
     We just have to get used to the fact in real world 
     there is no solution, and we can't trust anyone. The 
     best we can hope for is that power be widely diffused
     among many conflicting government and private
     institutions, any of which may be allies in opposing
     the encroachments of others-- much as in the United
     States today. ]
</pre>
  <p>All complex chaotic systems evolve through selection pressure, so does
  economic system, which will have to react to changing social and cultural
  pressures and select out the optimal one. It should contain both the elements
  of free market principles and state interventions to assure social justice
  without signigficantly infringing on individual rights to property and
  freedom, the goal always being an exploitation free society. That is a self
  evident axiom of humanism that no one can dispute. There can be a considerable
  room for variation within those ideals. A mathematically classless society is
  a Utopia. Even an uneducated wise farmer named <a href="http://mohaguru.humanists.net"><b>Aroj
  Ali Matubbar</b></a> realized it and commented that (From Collected works of
  Aroj Ali Matubbor, vol-1) :</p>
  <pre>
   [Exploitation free (Shoshonhin) society is not the same as
    classless (Srenihin) society. Socialism strives to achieve
    exploitation free society, not a classless society.&quot; (p-282)
   
   &quot;just as a human is not possible without its limbs, so is the
   establishment of a classless society not conceivable&quot; (p-283)]</pre>
  <p>Such utopian dream of a classless society is mathematically possible ONLY
  if every member of a society were truly selfless, had identical demands and aspirations
  among other requirements. Human species as we understand it from sociobiology
  will not satisfy it. Maybe a future progeny of human species based on a
  mixture of carbon and silicon, or just pure silicon might achieve that, but
  certainly not carbon based human species as we know it. The very notion that a
  dedicated, selfless elite will lead the communist revolution is an utopian
  one, as humans who desire to lead are prone to corruption. They may remain
  selfless during the revolution phase, but not guaranteed to remain so for
  ever. Nor is a selfless leadership guaranteed to succeed the initial selfless
  leaders during the later phases. An authoritarian dictatorship, by a few, even
  in the name of the proletariat cannot ensure checks or balances. Truly
  selfless people seldom harbor leadership aspiration, let alone strive for
  that.</p>
  <p>On the issue of atrocity, SH seemed to have taken a relativist position on
  it. Again, that is self defeating position to take. Because then any atrocity
  can be justified. Killing of non-combatant civilians, specially children and
  women, CAN NEVER BE JUSTIFIED. The atrocities of Pak military in 1971, the
  atrocities of Stalin are both wrong. Stalin ruthlessly killed hundreds of
  thousands of his potential opponents (political and ideological as well,
  suspected or real). The atrocities unleashed on the Polish by Stalin during
  second world war is well documented. If the atrocities of Stalin are defended
  by relativist arguments as was done by S.H then ANY atrocities by any
  dictator, by any political party in power to violently suppress its opponents
  can be defined by that same relativistic arguments. Such relativist argument
  then makes any criticism of oppression by AL, BNP or any party or government
  towards their respective opponents null and void. It is impossible to cite any
  atrocities that cannot be defended by relativist arguments.</p>
  <p>I am not sure what SH meant by &quot;I hope writer will not say that the
  killing done by Moktijodha in 1971 was atrocity&quot;. The killing by
  Muktibahini of Pak soldiers and their collaborators was not atrocities, but
  part of the accepted rule of engagement in war. That killing one's adversarial
  combatant is not an atrocity is self- evident. So I am not sure why this
  question was asked if that was what was meant. But if the killing of
  non-Bengali children and women by (SOME) Muktibahini members (It did happen)
  was meant then quite affirmatively that was an act of atrocity, a heinous one
  indeed. It would be an appalling thought if anyone thought that was not an
  atrocity. True, killing combatants in a war is not atrocity, as stated
  earlier. But killing defenseless children and women when such killing does not
  prevent or punish the military for committing their own atrocities, is an act
  that is grossly wrong morally. Not that killing innocent adult men are
  defensible. But killing innocent children and women, who don't pose any threat
  to the adversaries, reveals a spirit of pure bloodlust, not a spirit of
  struggle for freedom. Even in the religious or tribal warfares of the 7th
  century Arabia, children and women were spared, or were accountable if anyone
  broke that rule. But such killings in 1971 by some Muktibahinis were not
  subjected to any accountability, as far as I know. It is an irony that the
  killings of children and women in 1971 by SOME of those who were supposedly
  fighting to end exploitation and oppression in the name of religion, in fact
  outdid the religious atrocities of 7th century. The bottom line is<b> killing
  innocent human lives, specially when they don't serve any strategic advantage
  in a war, be it in the name of religion, communism, or gaining liberation, is
  wrong.</b> period.</p>
