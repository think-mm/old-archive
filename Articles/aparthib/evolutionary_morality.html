          <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          In two of my previous posts I have dwelt on two aspects of morality
          viz (1) The question of <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/morality_and_belief.htm#aparthib"><b>whether
          morality is defined by religion</b></a> and (2) <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6916"><b>If
          morality is purely subjective</b></a>. I wish to supplement the above
          two essays with a discussion on the evolutionary basis of moral
          instincts, which I had alluded to in those earlier essays but did not
          discuss it greater detail.
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          The view that morality is something not due to a pure physical
          cause-effect but due to some special <i>human</i> quality, not subject
          to the unconscious scientific laws, has been ingrained among many,
          even among many scientifically literate liberals and humanists.
          Morality, like human emotions of love and affection seems to them to
          be too lofty, too &quot;divine&quot; to be relegated to the
          mechanistic explanations of physical laws. To them it is almost an
          insult to the human spirit to discuss them in physical terms. Humans
          are not machines they contend. As I mentioned in my previous companion
          essay <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/14998">&quot;<b>Soul,
          Brain and the Laws of Physics</b>&quot;</a>, that such view really
          amounts to positing a human soul, to which these lofty values of
          morality and emotions are attributed to. I also pointed out that
          positing a soul leads to all sorts of contradictions and paradoxes.
          The fact is that the overwhelming evidence of science indeed points to
          a purely physical basis of the origin of morality and human emotions.
          The physical laws (Laws of Physics) acting in the background directs
          the forces of evolution, which ultimately leads to complex evolved
          organs to solve problems in order to survive and propagate the gene
          successfully under selection pressure. One of the most important organ
          evolved is the human brain (mind). Human brain is the paragon of a
          complex design from simple steps acting over a long (millions of
          years) time scale. There is nothing in human nature that is not rooted
          in human brain. It is important to realize that human brain is not
          crafted anew for each individual, rather it has imprinted in it an
          evolutionary history of all that has happened in the evolutionary
          past, (through what is known as the epigenetic rule) preserving all
          the knowledge of the successful survival strategies, in a cumulative
          fashion. The emergence of morality is intimately related to the
          evolution of the human brain in constant interplay with the
          environment and with other brains. What we call culture is not created
          by some entity external to human brains. Culture IS a creation (as
          another evolutionary strategy for maximizing evolutionary fitness of
          human species) of the human brain. Many view moral instincts as the
          product of culture, as if culture is something distinct from human
          brain. But as I argued culture itself is a creation of evolutionary
          forces and thus physical laws (acting on the brain and environment).
          As philosopher Donald Cameron says in the summary of his main
          arguments of his book &quot;The Purpose of Life&quot;:<br>
          <blockquote>
            <i>&quot;There is a popular fallacy that a further source of values
            for humans is an emergent property of culture. (Do not be deceived
            by the word &quot;emergent&quot;: it just means things are complex
            and no one knows what is going on.) These values are supposed to act
            over and above the values derived from our genetic evolution,
            largely replacing them. This idea cannot be justified. It may be
            regarded as one more example of our vanity, in trying to believe
            that we are different from the beasts in kind, not only in degree.
            We can understand how value information could be programmed into our
            brains by natural selection, but how could further values be
            invented by information which we pass from one brain to another? Of
            course we culturally transmit our values to each other, but these
            values originate in the brains, not in the transmission
            process.&quot;</i>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          So moral instinct (which also assigns values, i.e the
          &quot;ought&quot; to thoughts, emotions and actions,) itself is rooted
          in the laws of nature (Physics) via the working of the brain. Morality
          is latent in the laws of nature. It finds expression through the
          process of evolution. It seems almost common sensical/logical that if
          human brain and thus human mind is a product of evolution and subject
          to the laws of nature, then moral instinct, which is a product of
          human mind (over generations) must also be the product of evolution
          and thus ultimately the laws of Physics. Culture is the proximate
          cause, but the laws of physics the ultimate cause.
          <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          In the words of sociobiologist Edward O.Wilson : <i>&quot;ought is the
          product of a material process. The solution points the way to an
          objective grasp of the origin of ethics&quot;</i> (From his paper
          &quot;The Biological Basis of Morality&quot;)
          <p>How does evolution give rise to moral instinct? Evolutionary
          psychology provides the plausible scenario. Again in his paper
          &quot;The Biological Basis of Morality&quot; Edward O. Wilson
          illustrates it this way:
          <blockquote>
            <i>&quot;Suppose that human propensities to cooperate or defect are
            heritable: some people are innately more cooperative, others less
            so. In this respect moral aptitude would simply be like almost all
            other mental traits studied to date. Among traits with documented
            heritability, those closest to moral aptitude are empathy with the
            distress of others and certain processes of attachment between
            infants and their caregivers. To the hereditability of moral
            aptitude add the abundant evidence of history that cooperative
            individuals generally survive longer and leave more offspring.
            Following that reasoning, in the course of evolutionary history
            genes predisposing people toward cooperative behavior would have
            come to predominate in the human population as a whole.
            <p>Such a process repeated through thousands of generations
            inevitably gave rise to moral sentiments. With the exception of
            psychopaths (if any truly exist), every person vividly experiences
            these instincts variously as conscience, self- respect, remorse,
            empathy, shame, humility, and moral outrage. They bias cultural
            evolution toward the conventions that express the universal moral
            codes of honor, patriotism, altruism, justice, compassion, mercy,
            and redemption.&quot;</i>
          </blockquote>
          More insight into the evolution of morality is provided by Game
          Theory. A classic example being the Prisoner's Dilemma. Let us
          describe this dilemma concisely:
          <p>Two prisoners, A and B, are being held in separate cells with no
          means of communication. The prosecutor offers each of them a deal. He
          also disclosed to each that the deal was also made to the other. The
          deal he offered is this:
          <p>a) If one guy confesses that both of them committed the crime and
          the other guy denies it, then he will go free and the other guy will
          be sentenced to 5 years.
          <p>b) If you both deny the crime, then both will be sentenced to 2
          years.
          <p>c) If both confess to the crime, then both will be sentenced to 4
          years.
          <p>If someone confesses then he either goes free (0 years) or gets 4
          years. If he doesn't confess then he gets either 2 years (if both
          denies) or 5 years (If the other guy confesses) . So from each one's
          individual perspective the payoff is better if he confesses rather
          than denies (0 or 4 years is better than 2 or 5 years). So if both are
          logical and selfish they both should confess. The result is that both
          will fare worse than if they had BOTH denied, contradicting their
          individual logic! So if such prisoner's dilemma is repeated many times
          and if the two prisoners can communicate then even though they may
          initially both confess, by trial and error they will learn to
          cooperate instinctively and will evolve an ethical code &quot;thou
          shalt not confess&quot;. That's why criminal gang members do not tell
          on each other, Evolution works that way. Over millions of years,
          evolution has instilled an ethical sense starting from the tribal
          group of early people to the modern people. The sense of morality is
          not implanted in human mind from some transcendental realm, it is a
          hardwired instinct. Our &quot;feeling&quot; of conscience is an
          emergent property of the brain reflecting that hardwired instinct. And
          ethics is not a unique trait of human species. A primitive form of
          code of ethics is seen among wolf pack as well, where pecking order,
          punishment and rewards are observed. Of course, human brain having possessed
          the emergent property of self-consciousness has the most advanced and
          complex form of code of ethics.
          <p>Evolutionary biologists use the term adaptive for those instincts
          that favor the survival and propagation of genes, and those that
          hinder anti-adaptive. Moral instincts are the adaptive traits of
          evolution and are favored overwhelmingly over anti-adaptive traits.
          Evolutionary psychology not only explains the origin of moral
          instincts but also the origin of the &quot;immoral&quot; (can be
          neutral or anti-adaptive in the evolutionary sense) instincts as well.
          In Bible we see Jobs imploring God to explain why he is subject to so
          much evil and injustice? God did not provide any satisfactory answer.
          But now Evolutionary biology is offering a plausible explanation. In
          fact so much of evidence and insight has been gained in recent' times
          that a plethora of scholarly scientific books and articles have been
          written on the evolutionary origin of vice and virtue, on evolutionary
          ethics. So why do we have evil? If morality is selected by natural
          selection then why do humans have immoral instincts as well? It is
          best understood by analogy. One cardinal point is that evolutionary
          force, like humans are lazy, they try to achieve its goal (survival,
          propagation of genes) by the easiest/ simplest possible way. Let us
          take an analogy. Let us say the US military wants to kill the
          insurgents in an area. To kill only the insurgents it requires a lot
          of work to gather the information about the location and also a lot of
          planning and discipline to selectively target the bombing. It is much
          easier to bomb an extended area killing the maximum number of
          civilians, that is guaranteed to kill the intended insurgents but at
          the price of killing a large number of innocent civilians, as an
          overkill/collateral damage. Another nice analogy is provided by Gould
          and Lewtonin by the spandrel in arches. A spandrel is the roughly
          triangular region on either side of the top of an arch, a necessary
          but unintended byproduct of architectural design. An arch cannot be
          built without the spandrel. Immorality is the collateral damage of
          evolutionary strategies, so to speak. Evil is a necessary but
          unintended consequence of evolution.

          As Michael Shermer in his book &quot;How we believe&quot; nicely
          illustrates that human brain has evolved to:

          Among the above only (3) and (4) are evolutionarily adaptive. But to
          ensure that (3) and (4) can be true evolution, being lazy enables
          brain for all of the four possibilities. (1) and (2) are like the
          spandrel of an arch, collateral damage as in the carpet bombing. Also
          among the traits originating from (1) and (2) only those survive that
          are evolutionarily neutral (i.e neither clearly adaptive nor clearly
          anti-adaptive).
          <p>Among the collateral damage an important unintended instinct is
          rape. The reason the practice of rape still survives is that it is not
          anti-adaptive. The forces of evolution does not have a moral sense
          like we do. It does anything to help maximize gene propagation. And
          rape does not disfavour that. Not only that it may have served as one
          means of propgation in past. That is the theme of the book &quot;The
          Natural History of Rape&quot; by evolutionary biologist Thornbull and
          anthropologist Palmer. Their central argument is that &quot;rape is a
          genetically developed strategy sustained over generations of human
          life because it is a kind of sexual selection--a successful
          reproductive strategy&quot;
          <p>Thornbull and Palmer has been predictably misunderstood as
          condoning rape. They are not. It would be a naturalistic fallacy to
          promote a &quot;IS&quot; into an &quot;OUGHT&quot;. They were simply
          explaining the evolutionary origin of rape. But they were not
          justifying or condoning it. <b>Description is not prescription.
          Explanation is not exculpation</b>. Matt Ridley, another biologist
          also says <i>&quot;Rape was evolutionarily adaptive</i>&quot; in his
          book &quot;The Origins of Virtue.&quot; as quoted in p-45 of
          &quot;Sexing the Brain&quot; by neuropsychologist Lesley Rogers.
          <p>The presence of evil is an inevitable result of the physical laws
          acting to sustain equilibrium or stability and thus avoid extinction
          of a species. As I mentioned earlier evil is a necessary unintended
          byproduct of evolution. Lying can be seen to be another such necessary
          but unintended trait. As physicist Heinz Pagels nicely illustrates in
          his book &quot;The Dreams of Reason&quot;, page 330:
          <blockquote>
            <i>&quot;The new sciences of complexity and the perspectives on the
            world offered by computer modelling may teach us things that we did
            not realize about the values we hold. Science cannot resolve moral
            conflicts, but it can help to more accurately frame the debates
            about those conflicts. Take for example, the act of lying. We hold
            the telling of truths as a value; we are not supposed to lie. Yet if
            everyone told the truth all the time so that one could have complete
            trust in what one is told, then the advantage that would accrue to a
            single liar in society would be immense. This is not a stable social
            situation. On the other hand, in a society of individuals in which
            everyone lied all the time, society would be unworkable. The
            equlibrium state seems to be the one in which people tell the truth
            most of the time but occasionally lie, which is how the world really
            seems to be. In a sense, then, it is the liars among (and within) us
            that keep us both honest and on our guard. This kind of scientific
            analysis of lying can help us understand why we do it.&quot;</i>
          </blockquote>
          Just as evolution does not favor that all be truthful, it also does
          not favor all be liars. In favors some liars among a majority of
          truthful. Game theory confirms all this fundamental fact of nature.
          Basically it confirms the old cliché that evil is necessary so good
          can exist. But this time it is given a mathematical justification. An
          utopian world of no evil is theoretically impossible in a species made
          of carbon based life form as we know it.
