    <p align="justify">Myths and contradictions of apologetics of religion: </p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4">#1. That their Holy 
    Book&nbsp; is&nbsp; &quot;perfect&quot; because it is the word of God.</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">[ A perfect book should not suffer from flaws that only 
    an imperfect book of human origin can suffer from. Some flaws that 
    contradict perfect ness: (One flaw is enough to render it imperfect): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#800000"><b>A perfect book cannot contain 
      verses that lend itself to multiple interpretations, ambiguities&nbsp; and&nbsp; 
      controversies.</b></font> It should have been written clearly&nbsp; enough to 
      guard against such possibilities and should have been above all 
      controversies.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#800000"><b>A perfect book cannot be hard 
      to interpret/understand as is claimed by believers, when&nbsp; they try to&nbsp; 
      refute the criticisms against certain verses for its negative 
      connotations.</b></font> Perfection implies clarity&nbsp; by unanimous 
      judgment.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b><font color="#800000">A perfect book should have 
      mentioned the principles of science, if any, not in such a vague and 
      ambiguous way like some verses that the believers claim to contain 
      scientific facts of&nbsp; embryology and astronomy etc.</font></b> It is 
      inconsistent that text books written by humans contain scientific facts&nbsp; 
      can be so clear and precise while a perfect book written by God can be 
      so&nbsp;&nbsp; vague that there is no unanimity&nbsp; among humans as to its scientific 
      accuracy whereas&nbsp; scientific facts written by humans in science&nbsp; books are 
      unanimously agreed to by humans&nbsp; of all religions and beliefs. <b>
      <font color="#800000">Also as a perfect book, it should have answers to 
      all&nbsp; unanswered questions in science.</font></b> It should at least 
      certainly have&nbsp; the &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; in a succinct yet precise way 
      since it is the most profound insight about nature&nbsp; that human can ever 
      attain. Physicists all around the world of all denominations have been&nbsp; 
      searching for it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b><font color="#800000">A perfect book by God should 
      not contain cursing words of God against humans</font></b> (As in&nbsp; some&nbsp; 
      verses).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b><font color="#800000">A perfect book, cannot be 
      accepted as perfect only by a subset of humanity (followers of a&nbsp; certain 
      religion)</font></b>, a&nbsp; truly&nbsp; perfect book should have been recognized 
      as such by all of humanity. Perfection&nbsp; should be an&nbsp; objective concept .]
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4">#2. That many verses of 
    the Holy Book&nbsp; has to be judged in the light of its of its time when it&nbsp; 
    was&nbsp; written and not judged by today's standards.</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">[ <font color="#800000"><b>Well, then it is certainly not 
    a timeless book, which it should be if it has to be a perfect book as is 
    claimed.</b></font> If the Holy Book&nbsp; (or its certain verses) only makes 
    sense or has relevance in a certain period of history for a certain group of 
    people then it is by no means a perfect book written by perfect God. It is 
    of no more significance than handbooks or folk wisdom of various 
    cultures/sects/tribes. <b>There are many books or wisdoms of ancient 
    civilizations (Chinese, Greek, Mayan, Egyptians etc) that can also claim 
    relevance for their times and contained many useful info and scientific 
    facts as well, in equally vague manner.</b> <font color="#800000"><b>A 
    perfect book has to apply for all times.</b></font> Also if the purpose of 
    the verses are to provide solutions to a problem specific to a time and a 
    society, then it is failing as a perfect book, since a perfect book should 
    apply for all times and for all of humanity. Yes, it is true that certain 
    verses do exist that satisfy these requirements, but then a perfect book 
    should not contain even a single verse with limited applicability in terms 
    of time and society to which it applies.] </p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4">#3. That all the 
    criticisms by skeptics of negative verses in Koran&nbsp; are due to inaccurate 
    translations or&nbsp; misleading interpretation. Koran is hard to translate as 
    many verses are very subtle or complex and&nbsp; require great amount of 
    knowledge in Arabic and Islamic&nbsp; background.</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">The above can be better rephrased as: </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b>Koran is hard to understand.</b> </li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b>Arabic is a difficult language.</b> </li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b>It is difficult to translate Koran into other 
      languages&nbsp; [ by a) and&nbsp; b) ]</b> </li>
      <li>
      <p align="justify"><b>One has to be well versed in Islamic history and 
      Tafseers Interpretations of&nbsp; Quran by scholars) to fully understand Koran</b>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p align="justify">[First of all, <font color="#800000"><b>(a) is 
    contradicted by Koran itself. Verses 44.58, 54.17, 54.22 clearly says &quot;we 
    have made Koran easy to understand so they may pay heed&quot;. </b></font>Now is 
    there anyone to challenge that the above translation of the three verses is 
    incorrect? (a) is also contradicted by the assertion in #1 that Koran is a 
    perfect book. A perfect book cannot or should not be difficult to 
    understand. </p>
    <p align="justify"><b><font color="#800000">(b) is contradicted by Koran 
    since 44.58 also says that Koran was made easy to understand by revealing it 
    in Arabic (Thy tongue).&nbsp;</font></b> </p>
    <p align="justify">Secondly any language is not difficult to its native 
    speakers, or to one who has learned it well enough to be professor of Arabic 
    in a reputed university of an Islamic country. It can be hard for all 
    others. So (b) is irrelevant since all the major translations of Koran were 
    done by native Arab speakers or Arabic scholars. Now lets see the logic 
    behind (c) and (d). Firstly, <b>the believers who propagate these views 
    cannot be any more knowledgeable in Arabic than the respected translators 
    like Dawood, Shakir, Pickthall, Yusuf Ali to challenge their translations as 
    inaccurate.</b> And once the translations are accepted as accurate, it 
    cannot represent a factual error. Of course a translation will not always 
    carry the poetic, aesthetic and emotional appeal or value of the original, 
    but even a mediocre translation certainly cannot reverse its objective 
    meaning or alter any factual content which is what has to be done to a verse 
    to make it look negative and thus controversial if it is not genuinely so.
    <b>There is no reason for a perfect God to make its meaning so enigmatic and 
    open to misinterpretations.</b> Often when a verse is quoted in a religious 
    discussion the common remark heard is &quot;You have to read the 'correct' 
    translation&quot;. Sometimes Yusuf Ali is cited as reliable in these debates, 
    sometimes another, depending one whose translation best suits one in a given 
    context. Two interesting observations to make here:&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#000080">First,</font></b> the person making the above 
    remarks is presumably not as versed in Arabic or Koran as these 4 authors 
    are. So they are in no way to judge who is the best among the four or that 
    some of them are inaccurate.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b><font color="#000080">Second,</font></b> <b>all these four authors are 
    recognized without dispute as well versed in Arabic and Islam</b> (Some were 
    professor of Arabic in Islamic Universities etc) and all are Muslims 
    themselves and cannot have any hostile intentions against Islam and if their 
    translations were judged to have been intentionally distorted to hurt the 
    image of Islam then even a single copy of their translations (Let alone 
    millions of copies sold) would not have seen the light of day and they would 
    be outcast (possibly killed) by now. So to reject the translations of 3 in 
    favor of 1 by someone who is not even as well versed as any one of these 
    four scholars is highly questionable. For any reader not familiar with 
    Arabic the translation that the majority of these four translators agree on 
    should be taken as most reliable, even if the fourth one appears to be more 
    favorable to Islam's image. Choosing one interpretation over another as the<br>
    correct one has no compelling reason behind it. <b>After all no particular 
    translator was approved by GOD or prophet as the only authorized 
    interpreter!&nbsp;</b> If Koran is the word of GOD then for anyone to say Koran 
    is not easy to understand, only few &quot;knowledgeable&quot; person can truly 
    understand it is plainly contradicting the word of GOD ! Finally, (d) 
    suffers from two main contradictions. <b>As perfect book, Koran should be 
    self-sufficient, no supplementary reading should be required. </b>A perfect 
    book should contain all the knowledge that one needs to know. No human 
    knowledge (History, science etc) should be a prerequisite to understand a 
    divinely written book.</p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000"><b>Consider the following 5 points:</b></font>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><b>(1) <font color="#000080">God says Qur'an is easy to 
      understand</font></b> (44.58, 54.17,54.22)<br>
      CONCLUSION: A person with average knowledge of Arabic should understand 
      Qur'an and should be cognizant of the <font color="#000080"><b>FACTS </b>
      </font>and <b>INJUNCTIONS</b> mentioned in it, athough he may not 
      appreciate the poetic/aetshetic/phonetic quality in it. </p>
      <p align="justify"><b>(2) </b>An average knowledge of English is required 
      for someone who is <font color="#000080"><b>cognizant of a</b></font> <b>
      <font color="#000080">FACT or an</font></b> <font color="#000080"><b>I</b></font><b><font color="#000080">NJUNCTION</font></b> 
      in Qur'an to express it in English ACCURATELY (<b>Like &quot;4&quot; cannot change 
      to &quot;3&quot;, or &quot;yes&quot; cannot change to &quot;no&quot; etc.</b>) </p>
      <p align="justify"><b>(3)</b> A translation by a person with average 
      knowledge in Arabic and English may not convey the 
      poetic/aesthetic/phonetic quality of the original, but CANNOT alter/twist 
      the FACTUAL CONTENT of it. (Follows logically from (1) and (2) above) </p>
      <p align="justify"><b>(4)</b> Yusuf Ali, Shakir, Pickthall 's knowledge of 
      Arabic was much better than average. All of them had at least an average 
      knowledge of English, and at least&nbsp; Pickthall had better than average 
      knowledge in English being an English born. </p>
      <p align="justify"><b>(5)</b> The translations of Yusuf Ali, Shakir, 
      Pickthall agree with one another. </p>
      <p align="justify"><b><font color="#800080">CONCLUSION: </font></b>THE 
      TRANSLATIONS BY EITHER OF THE THREE TRANSLATORS ABOVE CAN NEVERCONTAIN ANY
      <b><u>FACTUAL MISREPRESENTATION </u></b>OF THE ORIGINAL.VERSES OR<br>
      DISTORT THEIR INTENTS. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Regarding the advice on reading the Tafseer before 
    reading Koran, it is again contradictory to the messages of Qur'an as Qur'an 
    (i.e God) clearly says in three suras (44.58, 54.17,54. 22) that Qur'an was 
    made easy to understand by God. Moreover verse 25.33&nbsp; says that <b>Qur'an 
    itself is the best explanation of the truth.&nbsp;</b> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><i><font color="#800080">If anyone who says Qur'an is 
      not easy to understand and so should read tafseer is <b>contradicting the 
      words of God .</b> </font><font color="#000080"><b>Secondly</b></font><font color="#800080"> 
      when God revealed Qur'an,&nbsp; he did not mention that one should wait until 
      tafseers are published before reading the Qu'ran.&nbsp;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify">The Qu'ran was revealed in easy language as claimed by 
    God and was meant to be read/followed/ understood right when it was 
    revealed. God never mentioned any tafseer by a designated author as the 
    authentic interpreter of Qu'ran. A faith in Qur'an as the word of God and 
    Muhammad as its messenger is only needed. The requirement that one should 
    read tafseers to understand Qu'ran is a dictum issued by humans, God or his 
    messenger never issued this dictum. So believing in this dictum cannot be 
    part of the belief in God or Koran. Belief in, but an additional article of 
    faith. No human has been divinely appointed to write an interpretation of 
    Koran.</p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><b>Finally</b></font> it is worth 
    noting that if someone points out some good points about a verse, no 
    religious apologist ever makes any of the statements (a),(b).. etc although 
    they should be equally applicable in principle, i.e if someone is possibly 
    mistaken about a negative verse for not reading the Tafseer, then by the 
    same criterion, one is no less likely to be mistaken about a positive verse 
    if read without Tafseer. In fact this betrays&nbsp; the fact that the very 
    definition of Tafseer is really nothing but a favourable interpretation of 
    Quran. Many scholars who had studied Quran and&nbsp; but are critical of it are 
    never recognized as scholars and their interpretation is never accepted as 
    tafseers.] </p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>#4. That all the 
    negative Hadiths are results of intentional distortion of ill-intentioned 
    people and do not truly represent the views of the prophet.</b></font> </p>
    <p align="justify">[<b><font color="#800000">Well, if one rejects the bad 
    things written in Hadith as lacking authenticity, then there is no logical 
    basis for accepting the good part as being authentic either. </font>One 
    cannot by any logic pick and choose in Hadith based on which one one likes 
    and dislikes. One has to either accept the entire Hadith or reject it in its 
    entirety since there is no objective criterion to decide which part is 
    authentic and which part is not, if at all one claims that hadith is a 
    mixture of both authentic and inauthentic parts. </b>There is also no 
    objective criterion to decide who is right between those who claim that the 
    bad parts of hadith are concocted and good parts are true and those who 
    claim vice versa or that both parts are authentic. Also there is no scope 
    for arguing for a misleading interpretation as the wordings of hadith are 
    quite straightforward and unambiguous. So to be consistent one has to either 
    conclude that the bad parts are true or that all parts of hadith are false. 
    Any other stance is a contradiction and is only to suit one's biased&nbsp; view.]
    </p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>#5. That science 
    vindicates the Holy Book. The Holy Book&nbsp; already contains many of the 
    findings of modern&nbsp; science. It is a&nbsp; miracle that the verses in it are 
    essentially accurate in discussing many&nbsp; scientific ideas even&nbsp; though they 
    were revealed long ago when science was not as developed as today, and the 
    ideas of DNA, gene etc were not known then.</b></font> </p>
    <p align="justify">[<b><font color="#800000"> If a perfect book written by 
    perfect God did intend to reveal a scientific idea, it should not have been 
    vague and metaphoric,&nbsp; but accurate and&nbsp; scientific enough that it can be 
    put in a physics /chemistry/biology textbook without the need of any change.
    </font>Not&nbsp; a single verse in the Holy Books contain even one scientific 
    term, like atom, electron, Theory of relativity, Uncertainty principle etc.</b> 
    A &quot;perfect&quot; book cannot be lacking in precision so much. And regarding the 
    defense of the vagueness of the verses for being thousands of years years 
    old, point can be made whether God knew about science then. How can perfect 
    God be constrained by lack of scientific knowledge millenia years ago to 
    reveal scientific ideas more precisely? <b>And as a perfect book, it could 
    at least be as precise as a popular science book, if not as precise as a 
    graduate text book. And most importantly, if the&nbsp; verses already contained 
    scientific facts, then why as a perfect book, it needed the human knowledge 
    of science to realize that they contain them? </b>Why didn't the verses 
    instill a scientific realization on its own, without having to wait 
    thousands of years for the development of science (by mostly non-religious 
    people) for its appreciation? It is also interesting to note some double 
    standard that exists among dogmatic believers in religion. On one hand they 
    claim that religion is beyond scientific analysis but on the other hand they 
    would not shrink a bit in jumping to cite any scientific principle to 
    validate their religious beliefs specially when some revelations/verses are 
    vague and general enough to be easily fitted to a paraphrased form of a 
    scientific principle. ] </p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>#6. That a 
    secularist/atheist is biased against believers/religion and that 
    secularism/atheism is no different form any religion since they preach the 
    &quot;dogma&quot; of secularism/atheism. Secularists&nbsp; have vested&nbsp; interest in their 
    opposition to religious&nbsp; belief.</b></font> </p>
    <p align="justify">[ The myth here lies in the fact that a non-believer 
    asserts his disbelief not as an attempt to promote or propagate a new dogma, 
    but only in response (reaction) to believers' insistence that their belief 
    is correct and their attempt in imposing it on the rest. The believers act 
    proactively and are in the offensive whereas the non- believers/skeptics act 
    reactively and are in the defensive. <b>The<br>
    non-believers would not have to resort to the critical study/research to 
    debunk the believers had the believers not taken their belief outside of 
    their private life and tried to thrust it on others.</b>
    <font color="#800000"><b>Atheists/skeptics/agnostics exist BECAUSE OF blind 
    believers and NOT the other way around. </b></font>It is the constant claims 
    and persuasive attempt to force the belief on others that created the 
    skeptics/atheists etc as a counter reaction. <b>A critical thinker hardly 
    ever tries to debunk the belief's of Tibetan Monks or the Shaman priests of 
    Japan. Most skeptics and critical free thinkers direct their time in 
    refuting the claims and preaching of persuasive members of revealed 
    religions.</b> So one has to be very careful here. Believers of blind faith 
    have great stake in the preservation and propagation of the perceived truth 
    of their belief/dogma and hence would defend any criticism of it without 
    caring to judge the merit of the criticism. On the other hand a non believer 
    of a blind faith has nothing to gain just by not believing and criticizing 
    any claims of truth of the blind faith holders. <b><font color="#800080">
    Their non- belief results from analytical thinking and thus they cannot 
    accept a belief irrationally just because they being told so. </font></b>Far 
    from gaining anything from the non- belief they rather take on potential 
    risk of back lash by the blind believers as well as depriving themselves 
    from the pleasant feelings generated by the blind belief. Anything that has 
    a rational basis will never be rejected or criticized by a rational person.
    <b><font color="#000080">So the bottom line is that a rational person who 
    decides not to believe in a blind faith can never do it out of any bias 
    against the believers since there is no apriority reason to be biased 
    against believers just as an adult who does not believe in a fairy tale is 
    not considered to be biased against children.</font></b> The relationship 
    between believers and non-believers is of a cause-effect nature. The 
    non-believers have no agenda/dogma to propagate, their only raison de etre 
    is to defend against the persuasive preaching of believers and to refute 
    their arguments defending their dogma. <b>Similarly atheism cannot be a 
    religion, since atheism is nothing but a denial of theism (a-theism, the a- 
    part indicates a negation). A negation of a dogma cannot be a dogma itself.
    <font color="#800080">Without theism, there cannot be atheism.</font></b><font color="#800080">
    </font>A dogma is a stand alone belief that does not need another for its 
    existence. So atheism cannot be a dogma. Also dogmatic believers describe 
    Secular Humanists as another form of &quot;fanatics&quot; who are trying to 
    fanatically promote their secular agenda etc. This is the height of fallacy 
    and sophistry. One thing that has to be understood and emphasized very 
    clearly is that humanists are committed to PREVENT/RESIST acts of human 
    rights violation. Fanatics on the other hand are bent on PERPETRATING human 
    rights violation. Human rights referred to above are clearly defined 
    universally and in the Declaration of Human Rights Charter of United 
    nations. Prevention/Resistance is a reaction to perpetration. Humanists came 
    into existence because of the<br>
    dogmatists.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="justify">Consider this. Long ago a believer called B-1 formed a 
    certain belief (due to a divine oracle, an epileptic seizure, temporal lobe 
    stimulation, whatever). Now look at then diagram below:</p>
    <div align="justify">
      <pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-1&nbsp; (Somehow forms a belief &quot;X&quot;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; B-1 Preaches &quot;X&quot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-2_____|_____N-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B-2 accepts&quot;X&quot;,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N-1 rejects)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; B-2 Preaches &quot;X&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-3____|____N-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B-3 accepts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N-2 rejects)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | B-3 Preaches &quot;X&quot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-4___|____N-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B-4 accepts,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N-3 rejects)
etc..</b></pre>
    </div>
    <p align="justify">So at the end of this three preaching we have a
    <font color="#800000"><b>set of believers B= (B-1, B-2, B- 3, B-4..)</b></font> 
    and a <font color="#800000"><b>set of non-believers</b></font>
    <font color="#800000"><b>N = (N-1,N-2,N-3..).</b></font> Now what we see is 
    that members of the set B now randomly picking on the members of set N to 
    try to preach again or to criticize them for not accepting their belief, for 
    example B-4 trying to preach/criticize N-2 etc. This provokes a backlash by 
    the members of N and they also try to debunk randomly the preaching of the 
    members of B, for example N-3 debunking B-2 etc. The end result is we have a 
    tension between two groups as a whole, B vs. N.&nbsp; <b>Now pause for a moment 
    and think. Who do you blame for this adversarial polarization into two 
    groups B and N? What is the root cause?</b> It is clear that the N-'s are 
    hanging free like a leaf with no trees below them (no preaching by them), 
    whereas the B-'s are each creating a tree beneath them and becoming the root 
    of that tree. Its the B-s' who are causing the birth and contributing to the 
    growth of the set B and N by trying to preach their believes onto others. 
    Now there are two sides to this. <b>The only way to avoid this bickering 
    between B and N would have been if none of the B-'s ever tried to pick on 
    the N-'s to try to preach again or criticize them for rejecting their 
    belief. </b>Such is the case with Buddhism, Hinduism, Taosim, Shamanism, 
    Bahai etc, in fact none of the religious beliefs except the three Abrahamic 
    religions have this two polarized groups with tension between them. The 
    other ideal way to prevent this polarization would be to stop preaching at 
    all. If B-1 kept his belief and never tried to preach there would not have 
    been this group polarization. So Mr. Aly, when you complain against a free 
    thinker of attacking your faith, try to stare at the above diagram and 
    understand who is the real culprit here., who really tried to impose their 
    belief on others. </p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><b>#7.) That non-belief in 
    a faith is itself a faith, i.e rejecting a belief in God is a faith too&nbsp; 
    like&nbsp; believing in God.</b></font> </p>
    <p align="justify">[ This is a very common glaring logical fallacy 
    illustrating the <b>SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF </b>fallacy of logic. 
    Non-belief requires logic, belief requires faith. Belief in a faith is 
    generated (in one's heart) due to personal wishes and emotional needs. A 
    non-belief is generated (in one's mind) as a reaction to preaching of a 
    faith which cannot be justified by logic or evidence. If every rejection of 
    a faith is characterized by faith, then one can literally create infinite 
    number of faiths by simply rejecting the assertions&nbsp; that all kinds of 
    entities like fairies, unicorns etc exist, or rejecting the claim that there 
    is life on the sixth planet in star-X, an alien landed in one's backyard 
    etc. <b>Faith cannot be generated solely through negation. A faith needs to 
    be a positive assertion postulating a truth about a belief.</b><br>
