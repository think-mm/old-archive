  <p>This is a follow-up on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/messagesearch?query=The%20%22Fallacy%22%20of%20Atheism.....">this
  thread</a> to <b><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/10090">my
  previous message</a></b>. Here I wish to dwell on the suggestion by some that
  there is evidence for the existence of God from scientific observations, i.e
  argument form design</p>
  <p><b>There are many who argue that the fact that the universe looks so
  orderly and designed, that must be an evidence of a &quot;creator&quot; This
  is called <font color="#FF0000">argument from design</font> (Rather
  intelligent design, &quot;ID&quot; in short) for the existence of God.</b> It
  is proposed as a sort of scientific proof for the existence of God. If the
  question is &quot;<i>Can Science be used to find God?</i>&quot;, the
  indisputable answer is NO. Although there are still some scientists who
  believe in some abstract creator God (but very few in the traditional God of
  revelations), no scientist today worth their reputation, can with a straight
  face claim to be able to prove the existence of God through science. What some
  can do and have done is to suggest &quot;intelligent&quot; design. But that
  also has now been shown to be an illusion in the way one looks and interprets
  scientific facts, not an assertion of an actual fact of observation. The
  argument for an intelligent design to prove the existence of a creator (God)
  is very old one. This is an intuitive argument that most humans, of any level
  of intellect come up with. This reflects a naive attempt to answer a very
  profound question that is really unanswerable. Saying that something which
  LOOKS designed IS designed is stating a conclusion (That &quot;LOOKS&quot; =
  &quot;IS&quot;) without a proof. Secondly to say &quot;is designed&quot;
  implicitly assumes that there already exists a designer, because &quot;looks
  designed&quot; , or &quot;doesn't look designed&quot; can only make sense with
  respect to a pre-existing designer. But that is assuming what one intended to
  prove in the first place! ( i.e that there happens to be a designer). To prove
  that &quot;looks designed = is designed&quot; one must first prove that there
  exists a designer and next has to prove that what is being claimed to be
  designed has indeed been designed by that designer and by nothing else. The
  proof, if has to be a valid one must involve both these two independent steps.</p>
  <p>The expression &quot;looks designed&quot; itself is a biased interpretation
  of human mind based on familiarity with previous experience. For example we
  know a watch is designed by a human from our previous knowledge of another
  watch being designed by a human, or by observing the cogs and springs in the
  watch which are known to be designed by humans etc. So being
  &quot;designed&quot; is a perception based on context and experience from
  similar instances. Hence &quot;LOOKS = IS&quot; is an inductive statement of
  generalization from familiar human experience. We encounter objects in the
  world, which we categorize into two classes, those that look designed due to
  our previous knowledge of many other similar things known to be designed by
  humans to serve human purpose, and things that look random (to humans) as they
  are known to be not designed by humans, found in nature. So according to our
  mental map, our world consists of a set of both orderly and random objects
  which enables us to inductively conclude if anything arbitrary we come across
  is designed or not. But such inductive generalization does not make sense when
  we push it to the extreme case of the entire creation and and call it
  designed, because, we don't have such similar experiences of many other
  universes that were designed by known designers. The whole universe we live in
  is just one instance. No inductive generalization can make any logical sense
  when applied to universe as a whole, because there is nothing similar to
  generalize inductively from! So the statement <b>LOOKS(Designed) = IS(Designed)
  is flawed</b> <i>if applied to the entire universe</i>. Not only that, the
  entire universe contains both designed and undersigned objects. So we cannot
  strictly say that the universe is designed because it is composed of undersigned
  (perceived) objects too.</p>
  <p>All the objects that we call designed, are called so because we KNOW they
  would not exist without a designer, a watch for example, where we KNOW there
  is a designer (A himan). But the same cannot be said about natural objects,
  like a tree. Because we don't KNOW (In the same sense as watch) that a tree
  would not exist without a creator (in the sense of a creator of a watch). We
  cannot extend inductive arguments from the class of man made objects to
  natural objects by rules of logic.</p>
  <p>The fact that humans and animals look like designed objects again is rooted
  in bias from knowledge about manufactured objects which are known to have a
  designer. Besides evolution can provide a much simpler explanation of
  emergence of complex organs of animals by selection and mutation. At the heart
  of all evolution is simple incremental steps dictated by laws of Physics. So <b>Laws
  of Physics can be said to be the designer of all living and non-living
  objects, in the entire universe, and behind the evolution (But not the
  existence) of the entire universe.</b> Do the Laws of Physics then need a
  designer? A law giver? Again we don't have any precedence at the cosmic level
  to inductively generalize from to arrive at this conclusion. <b>A belief in an
  uncaused, eternal God as the law giver is no more logically appealing than an
  uncaused eternally existing Laws of Physics governing the universe. </b>The
  former is explaining the known by an unknown, the latter is explaining a known
  by a known, obviously a simpler one. And simpler explanation is always
  preferred. Not that there is any absolute way to prove one or another.<b> The
  fact that the former &quot;explanation&quot; offers more emotional appeal to
  some does not make it a more plausible one from a rational or scientific view.</b></p>
  <p>The perception of something being designed or not designed is not a
  scientific decision, but inherently a subjective one, and thus not guaranteed
  to be accurate. For example some abstract piece of art, if we were not told
  that it was by a famous artist, may have been mistaken as due to accidental
  splash of colors. On the other hand, an artist may have spilled some color by
  mistake, but it may appear to be an impressive work of by him to someone
  unaware of that fact of spilling! In other words, there can be objects which
  look designed but have no designer, and there can be objects which doesn't
  look designed but indeed have a designer. As <b>Noble Laureate Steven Weinberg
  says:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#008000"><b>&quot;Even a universe that is completely
    chaotic, without any laws or regularities at all, could be supposed to have
    been designed by an idiot&quot; (p-232, &quot;Facing UP&quot;)</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So non-randomness or regularity is no guarantee of any conscious designer.</p>
  <p>Those who cites order in the universe as the proof of the existence of a
  creator invariably answers the question as to who created the creator by
  saying that the creator of the universe is uncreated and exists necessarily.
  Now if one insists that there exists a creator necessarily, then it is a
  fallacy to argue that a creator exists because there is order in the universe.
  Because if the creator exists necessarily, then its existence is independent
  of any order and would exists even if there is no order.<b> There is no reason
  to believe that a creator will always want there to be an order in the
  universe. A creator might very well choose to create an orderlies universe. An
  order or design has no significance without an accompanying
  &quot;intent&quot;.</b> We know a watch has a designer because we KNOW that
  there is a purpose or intention for designing it. If an object does not look
  designed or shows any mark of intent, we would not assume it has a designer.
  For example an artist may decide to design an abstract piece of art which
  unless one is told, may not look designed and would thus not be considered to
  have a designer.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><b>SO JUST AS NON-RANDOMNESS OR
    REGULARITY IS NO GUARANTEE OF ANY CONSCIOUS DESIGNER, SIMILARLY RANDOMNESS
    OR NON-REGULARITY ALSO IS NO GUARANTEE OF THE ABSENCE OF A DESIGNER EITHER.</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The whole argument of positing a creator based on the appearance of order
  or regularity is based on personal bias, not logic.</p>
  <p>Finally the perception that there are indeed eternal laws governing our
  universe itself is debatable. Many scientists have argued that the laws of
  science in its most elegant form is nothing but an intelligent construct of
  human mind starting from some very basic and simple, almost common sensical
  set of &quot;rules&quot;. For example Physicist and author Victor Stenger
  makes that point in his article at:</p>
  <p><a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Nothing/WhereLaws.pdf">http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Nothing/WhereLaws.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He also shows how the design in the universe can also be explained
  naturally without invoking a deity at:</p>
  <p><a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Found/12Godless.pdf">http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Found/12Godless.pdf</a>&nbsp;
  which is part of his book &quot;<b>Has science found God?</b>&quot;</p>
  <p>The question of the objective reality of scientific laws has also been
  addressed in my articles at:</p>
  <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MuktoChinta/message/3074">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MuktoChinta/message/3074</a>&nbsp;
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/7340">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/7340</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The second problem is in the &quot;logic&quot; that &quot;God created this
  universe because everything not random needs a creator, thus the universe must
  need a creator (God)&quot;. The logic above also contains an assertion of
  faith that God does not need a creator. <b>That is s case of mixing faith and
  logic.</b> The first part is applying a logic (inductive generalization). The
  second part (That God does not need a creator) is an article of pure faith,
  which is not dictated by logic. By mixing faith and logic one can make
  anything possible or impossible. By the same logic that one insists that <b>universe
  has to have a creator because it is not random, one must also insist that God
  (Surely not a random entity either) also has to have a creator too. So only an
  additional clause of faith can resolve this fallacy. <font color="#FF0000">But
  then that clause of faith is beyond rationalism and totally arbitrary.</font></b>
  Arbitrary and irrational article of faith can make anything possible or
  impossible mixing it with logic as mentioned earlier.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, in the very word creator, the &quot;-or&quot; implies a
  conscious being, something again derived from an inductive generalization
  based on human experiences, because all the objects we call designed in the
  world are known to be designed by human, a conscious being. But we don't call
  a snowflake designed although it certainly is not a random or irregular
  object. Although the advocates of design argument may call it an object of
  intelligent design of God also. So when ID advocates cannot identify a human
  designer of an object that looks designed (by human perception) they will
  postulate an invisible (conscious) humanlike designer. This is called argument
  from ignorance and is a fallacy. Moreover such an inductive generalization of
  a conscious designer is also a flawed extension of ordinary logic to uncharted
  territory where ordinary intuition and human logic is not guaranteed to be
  meaningful, let alone applicable. We already know that in the Quantum world
  ordinary causality does not hold. Events at the microscopic level do not have
  distinct cause-effect identities, they only satisfy certain fundamental laws
  which are completely time-symmetric. Causality is an emergent phenomena at the
  macroscopic level.</p>
  <p>Now let us turn to the so called <b>fine tuning argument</b> which is often
  cited as the proof for God. So many parameters in the universe seemed to be so
  finely tuned just so that life can flourish and evolve, which would not have
  been possible had any of those parameters been slightly different, hence there
  must be intelligent design at work behind such fine tuning. This argument is
  also scientifically flawed. The fact is that such fine-tuning is viewed as
  having a supernatural (i.e beyond physics) implication is due to (a) improper
  understanding of statistics (b) relying on our intuitive notion of causality
  from day to day experience and extending it to the extreme. To illustrate (a)
  for example, if we roll ten dice the likelihood of getting the sequence
  6526553214 is the same as the sequence 6666666666, both of which are equally
  likely and are also each very unlikely to occur in one trial
  (1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/ 6x1/6x1/6x1/6). But the former will not catch
  anyone's attention, the latter will. When one is dealt a hand of thirteen
  cards from an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards, the probability of being
  dealt that particular hand is one in 600 billion (52 factorial = 52 x 51... x
  2 x 1, to be exact) Yet, it would be absurd to conclude that he could not have
  been dealt that very hand because it is so very improbable or that there must
  have been a supernatural connection for him to get this rare hand!</p>
  <p>Another important aspect of probability that is not appreciated by many
  that time and numbers play a very important role in statistics. A very
  unlikely event will eventually occur given enough time. Or equivalently if
  many trials are conducted for an unlikely event simultaneously, one of the
  trial will materialize the very unlikely. Those who have studied statistical
  Physics will recognize this in the ergodic hypothesis, a very important
  concept, which basically says that a system will traverse all possible phase
  trajectories given enough time. <b><font color="#008000">The more common
  example of this is illustrated by the proverbial case of million monkeys
  hammering at the piano when one of them will end up composing Beethoven's
  fifth symphony after millions of years. If someone at that moment only
  witnessed that particular monkey, not aware of the other millions hammering
  away for millions of years would find it a miracle. The same is the case of
  the fact of our witnessing life in the universe</font></b>. We are amazed that
  out the billions of known stars and their planets only Sun harbors wonderful
  life forms and only in the planet earth. Is that a surprise. Life requires a
  sensitive range of conditions of temperature, gravity, density of atmosphere,
  right distance from star, right tilt of the axis etc for life to evolve. Only
  earth satisfies this condition. Its like 6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6 people rolling
  ten dice at once. One of them will certainly roll 6666666666. Any surprise?
  All the billions of planets are like ten rolled dice. Only one (earth) is
  666666666 (ie. has conditions suitable for life forms). So here we are, on
  planet earth wondering about life. If planet &quot;X&quot; instead satisfied
  the conditions of life instead of earth then we would be on planet
  &quot;X&quot;. But then we would call &quot;X&quot; earth. Its only a matter
  of label. Going a step further, it may appear that our universe with so many
  fine tuned parameters conspiring together to allow life to evolve in our
  universe must be special, an act of intelligent design. But there are two
  fallacies in such thinking. <b>There is no logical or scientific evidence that
  the APRIORI probability for those parameters to assume any other values are
  the same. We cannot rule out the possibility that the ultimate laws of nature
  (Theory of Everything, when it is discovered) require that the parameters take
  on the fine tuned values, allowing no other values. </b>Then it would not be a
  contingency, but a necessity of the laws of nature. Secondly we cannot rule
  out the new Quantum Cosmological view of infinite number of independent
  chaotic universes continuously being born and evolving with all different
  values of the Physical parameters, and where the universes which do not have
  the required values will not evolve to contain intelligent lives, or may not
  even have stars and die out soon. And there will be some which will lead to
  star formation and even life, which have the parameters within that narrow
  range, like the universe we happen to be in. It is analogous to the situation
  where among all the known planets and stars only Sun and Earth are suitable
  for life form. And as we saw above, that is a tautological fact. So the design
  can be ultimately traced to the laws of Physics, and it is the laws of Physics
  that will remain unaccounted for. But then causality is a human construct. The
  laws of Physics can simply &quot;BE&quot;. It need not be subject to the same
  laws of causality that other emergent phenomena in nature are seen to follow.
  To be conservative and honest, we have to say we don't even know what to ask,
  believe or theorize beyond a certain limit (which is always moving further),
  when it comes to ultimate reality of the very existence of the universe (or
  universes). <font color="#FF0000"><b>There is no valid scientific argument to
  prove the existence of a conscious creator or an intelligent designer. All
  such arguments at some point have to make an arbitrary assertion of faith and
  invoke some ill-defined non-scientific notion.</b></font></p>

  It is amusing, to say the least, to find such a document as A. Cressy
  Morrison’s “Seven Reasons Why a Scientist Believes in God,” still in

  scientific when it is not. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><b>(<a target="_blank" href="../../rationalism/god/god2.html">Read
