  AGAINST ARGUMENT FROM EVIL</font></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">By Aparthib Zaman</font></b></p>
  <p>One of the most damaging argument against the existence of God is the
  argument from evil, which says the presence of evil (Both natural and moral)
  implies lack of omnibenevolence, a defining attribute of God and thus
  contradicts God's existence. The usual response to that by apologists has been
  the free will defense, which briefly says that free will requires evil, thus
  God still exists but allows evil for the sake of free will of humans. Here I
  wish to engage in a critique of the free will defense by theist against the
  argument from evil. The words omnipotent = all-powerful, omniscient =
  all-knowing and omnibenevolent = all compassionate are attributes often
  applied to God, that he is all-powerful, knows all that can be known and is
  infinitely compassionate. We are often told that God knows all things
  throughout the entirety of time and space. Everything that can be known, he
  knows. Everything in the past, present and future is known to God. And he is
  all compassionate. I will argue that all these attributes run into conflict
  with the notion of free will unless at least one of the attributes are
  sacrificed. Religion says that God gave us free will, so that we may make our
  own decisions, decide our own futures, with no coercion from God. Whether we
  do good things or bad things is entirely up to us, God just sits back and
  watches over us knowing ahead of time (through omniscience and prescience)
  each and every action that we will do. The problem is if God knows today what
  we will do tomorrow, then we cannot do anything other than what God knows we
  will do tomorrow, otherwise he will be wrong and not be omniscient. But then
  if could not do anything other than what Go already knows then where is the
  free will? If God knows what someone will do in future then that implies that
  something (by God or any other factor) must have determined what that person
  will do. Free will only makes sense if one can choose one action from several
  possible ones solely based on his/her own will. But we just saw that only one
  action can be chosen, the one that God knows today that we will actually do
  tomorrow, and no other. So free will does not exist in its strict definition.
  In other words if you truly have free will then you should be able to do
  something that even God cannot know ahead of time. True free will should have
  the ability to prove even God's knowledge of one's future action to be wrong.
  But such free will then is obviously incompatible with another attribute of
  God, viz omniscience. So either way a logical contradiction arises. Secondly
  if God knows ahead of time that someone will commit an act of evil in future
  because of omniscience then that implies that God is not omnibenevolent for
  not preventing that person from committing the evil. If not preventing someone
  from committing evil even when knowing ahead of time that the evil will be
  committed is considered to be the right thing to for God for the sake of free
  will then the same must be true for humans. SO that would imply that A should
  not prevent B from committing an evil, since that will interfere with the
  freewill of B. But that is not considered morally good for humans. So
  omniscience and free contradicts omnibenevolence of God and leads to moral
  contradiction for humans.</p>
  <p>As a last attempt to resolve this inconsistencies of attribute of god with
  one can argue, well, god can actually through omnipotence, endow himself with
  omniscience or rob himself of it if and whenever he chooses to, in other
  words, he has the switch which he can turn on and off at will to gain or loose
  omniscience anytime. And for our freewill to work he CHOSE to be not
  omniscient about our lives. Omnipotence allows god to become omniscient if an
  when he chosen to, and hence these both attributes are not really
  incompatible. Now leaving aside the question as to how the one who argues that
  way came to know about this remarkable switch of God, let us instead examine
  this argument more closely.</p>
  <p>Let's say god decided to turn the switch on so he indeed became omniscient.
  So God now knows everything about the future of anyone, anything. But suppose
  now he wanted to change the future of someone. Can he do it? NO! because if he
  could then in that case his knowledge about the future of that person just
  before he changed that person's future would be wrong, which would cause God
  to loose omniscience. In other words, God CANNOT as a choice turn the switch
  of omniscience on AND change someone's future while preserving omniscience. So
  God looses omnipotence in that case for not being able to exercise this
  particular sequence of choices. So the contradictions between these two
  attribute cannot be removed by this switching of omniscience clause. Now let
  us discuss and debate the usual arguments of Free Will Defense of Theism.
  Theists posit that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. The
  argument from evil (AE) against the existence of God can be summarized as :</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b>1. God is omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>2. God being omniscient, knows the existence of evil.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>3. God being omnibenevolent, has the intention of
    eliminating the presence of evil.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>4. God being omnipotent, can eliminate the presence of
    evil.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>5. From 2,3 and 4, we can deduce that the presence of God
    imply the absence of evil.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>6. There IS evil.</b></p>
    <p align="left"><b>7. From 5 &amp; 6,therefore,we deduce that God as defined
    in (1) does not exist.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The usual response of the religious apologetics against the above argument
  from evil by skeptics is the free will defense, summarized as : Free Will
  Defense (FWD) of theism against AE :</p>
  <p>1. God had two choices : create beings 1-a)with free will or 1-b) without
  free will (law of excluded middle).</p>
  <p>2. The creation of beings with free will who can commit evil (1-a), is
  BETTER than creation of beings without free will (1-b), who can only commit
  good</p>
  <p>3. God always does what is BETTER i.e choose (1-a)</p>
  <p>4. Therefore, in view of 2 and 3 above, God cannot but create beings with
  free will with the capacity to commit evil.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this defense makes three critical mistakes. The first
  mistake, which is the most obvious, is the assumption that free will is better
  then the capacity to do no evil. It is rather difficult to agree with the idea
  that all the evils that man has ever committed are all justified by the
  freedom of free will and the trade off between free will and evil is that
  obvious. Only very few who has never suffered the consequences of evil or are
  themselves perpetrators of evil can say without any qualm that free will (with
  a baggage of capacity for evil) is preferable to no free will (with no baggage
  of capacity for evil), since they are the biggest beneficiaries of free will,
  not the victims. Another argument by defenders of free will argument is that
  without freewill and the ability to choose evil human becomes becomes like a
  robot. But then calling a perfect human a &quot;robot&quot; is a personal
  subjective use of a label. By the same token if all humans with free will
  abided by the rules of God (Which God wishes anyway) and and didn't commit any
  wrong then they would equally well become robots. Just like robots obey the
  computer commands, humans would obey the divine commands. There is no profound
  difference between the two. By that logic all humans will become robots in
  heaven since no evil will exist there. Besides there is an inherent
  inconsistency in the concept of a perfect being (GOD) crafting an imperfect
  product (human). Imperfect products can only come from imperfect designer.
  Finally the word &quot; better&quot; in (3) above is being argued by humans
  (apologists). How are they to know what God thinks is better?. They are
  judging better in a post hoc fashion, i.e predicting a cause from the effect!
  If humans had not committed any wrongs then the post hoc logic could have been
  changed to, God being perfect is not allowing anyone to commit any evil. So
  this kind of defensive reasoning by humans for God is convenient and self
  serving to justify a foregone conclusion. God never himself argued this way
  justifying evil (either in Koran or Bible or anywhere). A human can never know
  what God wants or thinks and argue on God's behalf unless God says it himself
  in any revelation. The word &quot;BETTER&quot; above is a highly subjective
  judgment call and only favours those who can benefit from a free will with
  capacity for evil. Also another tacit assumption is that without evil there is
  no good. That without the potential to commit evil there would be no meaning
  of good and no one would appreciate what good is. And since evil is committed
  through the exercise of free will hence free will is necessary for evil which
  is necessary for the meaning of good. This kind of argument about the
  &quot;logical&quot; impossibility of the absence of evil has been formulated
  elegantly by philosopher Platinga. But Platinga's contention is like an astute
  lawyer defending his client by clever reasoning who may not believe in his
  client. Platinga's argument does little to prove the notion of God as
  envisaged in religions. It only allows a logical possibility of God with those
  atrributes that can be allowed by human logic, so effectively renders
  &quot;God&quot; a notion to play with by logicians Anyway, we are interested
  in the notion of God of the traditional religions. Then the question arises
  why does God instruct human not to commit evil and to do good and threaten
  punishment for non-compliance and reward for compliance? Obviously not all
  human will commit good, if they did then evil would not exist, and the meaning
  of good will cease to exist. So for the meaning of good to exist and for human
  to appreciate it some evil must be committed. So God has to make sure that
  some do commit evil. So on one hand God is instructing all to commit good and
  stay away from evil and at the same time he is required to maintain some evil
  to make the sure the concept of good survives for human so as to inspire them
  do it. In that case blaming/punishing human for committing very same evil that
  is required to be committed to maintain the value and meaning of good for
  others would be a logical contradiction for a perfect/
  omnipotent/omniscient/omnibenevolent God. An omniscient God would know all the
  crimes and wrongs to be committed by anyone ahead of time (omniscience implies
  prescience) and in that case expressing anger (as reflected in many verses of
  Koran and Bible referring to punishment in Hell) after it is committed while
  knowing beforehand that it was coming is contradictory to omnibenevolence.
  Furthermore if one insists that some evil is essential for good to exist, then
  that implies that evil should not be prevented, only reddressed. So it is
  imperative that a disease be not prevented, only treated. Similarly it becomes
  imperative not to prevent occurrence crime, but reddress it (punish,condemn)
  after it has happened, because prevention would make evil non-existent and
  thus render &quot;good&quot; meaningless. So we see that this argument for
  evil as essential for &quot;good&quot; leads to a contradictory situation.</p>
  <p>So God as envisaged in the revealed religions suffers from two inherently
  contradictory desires, which is not consistent with the attributes of a
  perfect being. Besides if good and happiness requires the existence of evil
  and suffering then why is there no evil and suffering in heaven which is
  supposed to be a place of perfect goodness and happiness? Most importantly, is
  it consistent with an omnibenevolent being to require that evil be committed
  on children, innocent men and women (after all evil is defined as wrongs
  perpetrated on the innocent, not on the wicked) just so that the victims ( if
  they survive) or those who were spared can appreciate the good? It violates
  all common sense and any moral standards that one can conceive of. Some
  apologists say &quot;Well, God' s intentions are beyond human comprehension,
  standards and common sense&quot;, but that's an assertion of no substance,
  because if God's intentions is truly beyond human comprehension then one can
  say nothing about God, one way or the other and the apologists (who are human)
  have no basis of defending God either or to contradict what their opponents
  are saying. Moreover this kind of reasoning has inherent inconsistencies. One
  cannot make an argument based on ignorance of facts. The whole point of this
  debate is to refute or prove that God exists. Now one cannot refute the
  argument which says that God cannot exist because of the incompatibilities of
  the various attributes that define God by arguing that &quot;God&quot; works
  in mysterious ways!. &quot;God works in mysterious ways&quot; assume God
  exists which was supposed to be proven in the first place. More importantly
  one cannot start out with logic trying to prove God exists and give up logic
  halfway and appeal to &quot;mysterious&quot; logic to arrive at the conclusion
  that God exists. One could as well have started out with the conclusion that
  God exists, and that would have as much validity as invoking a mysterious
  working halfway. Mysterious logic can be made to arrive at any conclusion by
  either side.</p>
  <p>The second mistake is the tacit assumption that free will necessarily
  entails a choice of evil, ie. if we have free will then it is impossible to
  avoid evil altogether, free will must involve choice of either good or evil. That's
  how the apologists explain the presence of evil as an inevitable consequence
  of free will. But that's a fallacious presupposition. Free will is the
  capacity to choose. A choice is picking between many options. By saying that
  free will necessarily entails evil they are implying that our options are
  limited to either good, or evil, that a choice only between many goods are not
  possible, i. e there cannot be more than one good options. But we know that's
  not true. We come across many situations where there can be two good options
  along with one or more evil options. So free will can entail choices between
  good. What is really an important prerequisite of free will is the FREEDOM to
  choose from whatever choices are given to us, period. What choices are given
  to us do not determine the freedom. So evil as a choice is not essential for
  freedom. Even with presence of free will we don't have the choice of doing
  many things. We can't choose to make ourselves disappear, or to fly or float
  in the air without any mechanical aid. If we can retain free will even without
  such abilities then surely we can retain our free will even if deprived of the
  evil options. If God is all-powerful, then why does he not eliminate all the
  evil options and only provide good/neutral options to choose from using free
  will?. He could have provided options between goods of varying degrees and/or
  neutral (i.e which doesn't benefit or harm). Since evil do exist then either
  God if he exists, is not all- powerful or he does not want to see evil
  disappear. In that case he(God) cannot be all compassionate. We can also
  imagine many scenarios in which free will is compatible with an omnipotent God
  and no evil. For instance, God could use magical power to &quot;physically
  restrain&quot; those who intend to commit evil. Perhaps they would find it
  frustrating, like the repulsive force between two magnets, he could feel a
  repulsive force restraining him to do the evil, but their &quot;free
  will&quot; to do harm would nevertheless remain intact. After all free will is
  a subjective mental perception. As long as one can feel in their mind that
  they can make a will without interference then free will exists, regardless of
  whether the will is actually fulfilled or not. But since such magical
  prevention of evil does not happen then again that proves that an omnipotent
  God if exists cannot be omnibenevolent. Let us further analyze free will (or
  its absence) carefully. It seems that the manner in which humans are endowed
  with freewill is contradictory to the concept of fairness (Another necessary
  attribute of a perfect God). If right or wrong choices by humans were made
  under conditions that humans had complete choice on then it is understandable
  that humans could be held accountable for their choices. But we know that the
  acts that people choose to do are very much dictated by their
  minds/personalities which in turn are dictated by their genetic inheritances
  and the effect of environmental stimulus on the neural connections in their
  brain that occurs since birth, both of which an individual has no choice on.
  If genetic plus environmental influence makes one more prone to commit an evil
  then he/she would have to struggle harder to stay away from it (or maybe
  impossible to stay away from it in case the influence is so deep that he/she
  cannot even judge right and wrong and views morality as blind rules imposed
  unfairly by society and religion) whereas in a human whose genetic+
  environmental influence made him/ her less prone to commit evil and more prone
  to do right then it would require much less effort to stay away from evil (As
  it comes &quot;naturally&quot; regardless if morality is set by society or
  religion). So there IS some element of programming in human nature and hence
  there can be no true 100% free will. A true free will which enables one to
  choose right from wrong would make sense if all humans were born with a clean
  slate that can only be written with conscious choice at each step, in other
  words if they had the choice as to what personality/mind they could have. But
  genetic inheritance and environment's effect on the neural connections of the
  brain cells invariably makes the slate pre written and humans don't have any
  choice on how their personality/mind will evolve, instead it is decided for
  them by gene and environment by the time full consciousness develops in them.
  If God is to hold each human accountable for their acts at an individual level
  then it behooves him to endow more freedom to each human being than there
  seems to be. The third mistake of the FWD apologetics is the omission of
  natural evil (i.e epidemic, plague, earthquake, floods etc) that are not
  committed by human. If god exists, he made everything, including natural evils
  or has the capacity to prevent it. It is therefore an evil on his part to
  allow it. The Free Will Defense cannot justify this natural evil by their
  usual argument. Sometimes the natural evil is explained by saying that it is
  the punishment of God for the sins of human. Which human? The greatest
  casualty of all natural evils are mostly innocent children, women and men. The
  evil doers in most cases escape unhurt. The natural evils happen quite
  randomly and kill people with no selective bias. Good and bad people alike
  fall victims to it, a situation that can be nicely explained the absence of
  God and by nature' s random acts. The great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 killed
  the all the worshippers in the churches that gathered to commemorate the death
  of a noted saint, as well as many innocent women and children. But it spared
  many brothels. Another defense of the natural evil is that it is for a greater
  good. Good for whom? Not the millions who died? And when does the greater good
  take place? No greater good seem to have followed much of the natural
  disasters. Of course there can be some beneficiaries from the miseries of
  others. But is that compatible with an omnibenevolent God? Another response by
  the apologists are: &quot;What we perceive as evil in this world is a result
  of our limited knowledge and these evils are part of a grander scheme of God
  and are not really evil, but part of a greater good that we can't see. God has
  reasons behind everything&quot;. Now in the name of &quot; limited
  knowledge&quot; these apologetics are asserting something that require
  extraordinary knowledge, like knowing that God has a reason behind all evil. A
  limited knowledge cannot lead to this profound assertion!. They are being
  inconsistent within themselves by saying this. Besides if we accept this
  argument on faith, then one can also argue back that what we perceive as good
  in this world can also be an illusion and can be part of a greater evil that
  we can't see with our limited knowledge. This argument is equally acceptable
  as a faith. So this kind of reasoning can be always applied no matter how much
  evil is observed. If evils only happened to wrong doers and innocents were
  always spared from suffering without exception then this kind of reasoning
  would immediately point to God's justice and fairness in action. In absence of
  such ideal situation the reasoning is modified and appeal is made to the
  limitations of human comprehension to justify the far from ideal situation of
  evil and a hidden reason behind it. This kind of reasoning is so opportunistic
  that it would always provide an explanation of any given reality, in favor of
  the benevolence of God irrespective of the amount of evil and suffering that
  is observed. Is there any level of evil and suffering that would convince a
  believer that God is not omnibenevolent after all? Certainly not, because the
  level we see now is already quite substantial and is consistent with the non-
  existence of God and a random act of nature. So it all boils down to believe
  in an omnibenevolent God first and then use all kinds of &quot;post hoc&quot;
  (after the fact) arguments to &quot;explain&quot; away the observed evil and
  suffering. So this apology also does not hold under close scrutiny and thus
  free will and the existence of evil by humans is incompatible with the concept
  of an omniscient/omnipotent/ omnibenevolent God.</p>
