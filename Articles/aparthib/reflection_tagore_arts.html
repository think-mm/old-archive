  <div class="doc-layout-body">
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">May 7 is the 144th birth anniversary 
	of Poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Being a Bangali poet the Bangalis 
	celebrate his birth anniversary following Bangla calendar which occurs on 
	25th of Boishakh, which happens to be on May 9 in Kolkata and May 8 in Dhaka 
	this year. This shows the problem of the lack of a uniform standardization 
	of Bangla calendar leading to this unfortunate result of two major centers 
	of Bangla language and culture observing the birthday of this great 
	International artist of Bangla on two different days. Anyway, on this 
	occasion I wish to present my thoughts on Tagore and attempt to link Tagore 
	the man and his work and with the general notions of arts, politics (more 
	specifically nationalism) and rationality. I will, as has been my wont, be 
	guided by a rationalistic approach. Most of my comments, observations and 
	quotes on Tagore will be based on the scholarly book on Tagore called &quot;Rabindranath 
	Tagore - The Myriad Minded Man&quot; by Krishna Dutta and Andrew Robinson&quot;. It 
	should be understood that all my factual observations about Tagore are 
	derived from this book. I am not providing exact page numbers, but if it 
	becomes a subject of debate I will provide detailed references as needed. 
	Let me comment on the book a little. This book was published in 1995 by St. 
	Martin's press, NY. This book is doubtless the most authoritative and 
	scholarly work on Tagore the man. Any debate, controversy, confusion can in 
	most cases be settled by referring to this tome. This is the ultimate portal 
	on Tagore. With 15 pages of bibliographic references and 90 pages of 
	annotations from the references, plus many personal contacts with celebrated 
	poets andf artists living and dead, Indian and international, many of whom 
	had direct contact with Tagore, it is a veritable mine of information on 
	Tagore. In addition the authors consulted the archives of the libraries in 
	Shantineketon, Vishwa Bharati University and the London library, there is 
	conceivabley no more exhaustive source of information on Tagore. Besides the 
	authors are already experienced in Tagore related work. Let me also mention, 
	as it will be relevant later, that the authors, like a truly scholarly work 
	should, have analyzed Tagore in dispassionate manner, neither idolizing him 
	nor making any biased or unfounded criticism. A clear admiration for Tagore 
	is unmistakable, but they do not hesitate to expose the foibles and 
	limitations of Tagore. Anyway on to the main discussion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There has been a lot of debate and 
	criticism about Tagore in various forums and in print media as well. One 
	important point that these debates seemed to have overlooked is the need to 
	clearly separate the subjective from the objective in discussing or debating 
	Tagore, or for that matter any poet and artist in general. Art appreciation 
	being purely subjective, there is little room for debate. If someone doesn't 
	like the work of an artist for its style or theme, it makes little sense to 
	engage in any argument or debate with him/her about it. Arguments or debates 
	can make sense only when it involves propositions ( Sentences which are 
	unambiguously and objectively either true or false). Any view on the style 
	or theme of an artwork has to be necessarily subjective and personal, which 
	cannot be objectively reduced to true or false category. Much of the 
	literary criticism is really expressions of personal views of the critics. 
	There is no true objective language for art criticism. A new linguistic 
	structure called <a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/eprime.htm">eprime</a> as 
	suggested by Robert Anton Wilson, author of
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1561840718/freethinkers">
	Quantum Psychology</a>, may be ideally suited to art criticism. Casting art 
	criticism in eprime can avoid the pitfall of bitter debate between the 
	critics and the fans. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yes, a critic/critique can analyze 
	poems based on such objective factors as metres and rhymes, or songs and 
	compositions based on the melodic structures etc, but why certain patterns 
	and structures of these art forms should appeal to human mind more 
	aesthetically than others, that would remain in the final analysis a 
	subjective issue in arts. It may be that there may be some structure or 
	pattern in an artist's work that majority tend to find appealing 
	aesthetically. But to judge those art as beautiful because of the fact that 
	the majority find it appealing is an a posteriori (after the fact) judgement 
	of aesthetic quality of the art. A truly objective criteria for deciding the 
	artistic beauty should be a priori, before knowing how it will appeal to the 
	majority. One should be able to decide it by simply reading the work, not 
	waiting for a poll of other reader's reaction. Like the proverbial conundrum 
	of morality, where the question of whether an act is prohibited by 
	God/religion because it is immoral or whether an act is immoral because it 
	is prohibited by God/Religion can never be settled by language and pure 
	logic alone, similarly the question of whether an artwork is beautiful 
	because majority likes it, or whether the majority likes the artwork because 
	it is beautful cannot be settled through language or logic. In either case a 
	deeper understanding of the way evolution works reveals the real origin of 
	moral and aesthetic sense. Evolutionary psychology can explain the objective 
	reasons why certain patterns or structure in any art form appeal to human 
	brains more, based on the laws of evolution, but the human brain does not 
	rationally decide to &quot;feel an appeal&quot; for those elements of art because of 
	the evolutionary reasons for the appeal!. Feelings precede any rational 
	understanding! To summarize, the feeling or perception of art is subjective, 
	but the origin of that subjective feeling is objective. For example the 
	feeling or perception (or &quot;qualia&quot; as is kown in psychology) that blue color 
	generates in the brain is subjective, which cannot be verbalized, but the 
	cause of that feeling is the wave length of the blue light, an objective 
	reason. For a detailed discussion on the link between evolution and 
	aesthetics I refer the readers to my essay on
	<a href="../../new_site/mukto-mona/Articles/aparthib/science_aesthetics.html">
	Science Aesthetics</a>. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So how do we decide on the intrinsic 
	greatness of an artist like Tagore? Sheer volume of the work? The volume of 
	Tagore's ouvre is certainly impressive. But the problem of this criteria is 
	that again its ia an after the fact criterion. In Tagore's case he continued 
	to be a prolific writer till his death. So are we to wait until the death of 
	the poet to make a tally of his total work and then judge his greatness by 
	the volume? Another problem is that if mere number is the criteria, then 
	volume cannnot a unique mark of greatness, because given enough spare time (Tagore 
	was fortunate to have plenty of it) and the urge to write many &quot;below 
	average&quot; artist can churn out large volumes of work. Of course lack of 
	enthusiastic response may put a damper on the urge to write indefinitely for 
	those poetasters. When Tagore received his Nobel Prize, certainly his volume 
	of work then was much less. Did the Nobel committee award him the prize for 
	the volume? Certainly not. Quite obviously they thought of him as a great 
	poet based mainly on the translation of Gitanjali. So should Tagore be 
	considered great because he received the Nobel prize? If so, then the volume 
	issue becomes irrelevant in judging greatness. But why did Gitanjali appeal 
	to them? Here again we will eventually reach a dead end if we try to stick 
	to finding a chain of objective reasons all the way down. At certain level 
	down there has to be a subjective call. For one thing the Nobel committe 
	made their judgement based on the translation of Gitanjali. Now much of the 
	intrinsic quality of an art gets lost in the translation. Two very 
	influential exponent of Tagore Niraud Chaudhury and Satyajit Ray had opined 
	that Tagore's poems are untranslatable. Much like the religious followers 
	say about their scriptures. If that is the case then truly the Nobel 
	committee's judgement of Gitanjali has to be subjective. What was in 
	Gitanjali that impressed the Nobel committee? Who can say definitively what 
	went into the minds of these people. But it was clear that the primary 
	appeal of Gitanjali to the West was due to its pereived humane spirit of 
	christianity, as explained by Yeats. Yeats commented that the West was moved 
	by Gitanjali not by its exoticity, but because it found its own image in it. 
	Paul Nash, the well known war artist commenting on Gitanjali said that he 
	read Gitanjali like he read the Bible for comfort and strength. Times 
	Literary Supplement of Nov 7, 1912 commenting on Gitanjali wrote: </font><i>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we read his pieces we seem to 
		be reading the Psalms pf David of our own time who addresses a God 
		realized by his own act of faith and conceived according to his own 
		experience of life...&quot; </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It may be mentioned that Gitanjali 
	was not considered the best work of Tagore anyway among the then Bengali 
	readers and critics. So certainly the basing Gitanjali to judge Tagore's 
	greatness is an inherently subjective matter. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The criteria closet to an objective 
	one may be the diversity of the work of the artist. Not many artist are 
	gifted with creativity in multiple genre of arts. Tagore had that gift and 
	utilized that gift to the fullest. He was a poet, a dramatist, novelist, 
	short story writer, non-fiction writer, mystic (Despite it's definition 
	being fuzzy), painter, songwriter. Not many know that his paintings number 
	about 2500, almost as many as the songs he composed, but his paintings were 
	appreciated more in France and Germany than in India/Bangla. But again the 
	issue of quality (hence subjectivity) cannot be completely sidestepped even 
	in the criteria of diversity. For example his number of paintings are about 
	the same as the number of songs. But to Bengalis his paintings have far less 
	appeal and are less widely known than in the West. Although The Post Office 
	is a widely popular play, all of his plays are non-starters (As commented by 
	the authors in the Myriad Minded Man). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So at the end the question of 
	whether the Nobel award to Tagore was fair and truly deserving cannot be 
	settled by debate. The view that he did deserve accords well with Tagore's 
	assessment of the overwhelming majority, specially among Bengalis. But there 
	should be no illusion that there were no doubts among many of the well known 
	poets outside India, and that there was universal admiration for Tagore 
	among all international poets and literateurs. Even though it was a British 
	poet and Royal Society Fellow Sturge Moore who suggested his nomination for 
	Nobel Prize to the Swedish Nobel Committe, other fellows of the Royal 
	Society were not impressed by Tagore, and they were disappointed at Tagore 
	being awarded the Nobel prize and not Thomas Hardy. Beyond the Nobel award 
	issue, in general there was dispraise as there was praise for Tagore among 
	amny other poets. Even Yeats who had admired Tagore and who introduced 
	Tagore to the British poets, later made a critical remark about Tagore's 
	later poems saying that these later poems are drowning his reputations and 
	Tagore and that nothing more should have been published except the long 
	autobiograph after Gitanjali and The Gardener and The Crescent Moon ! 
	British poet Philip Larkin was very negative about Tagore. Edward Thompson, 
	who wrote Tagore's biography wrote in a letter to W.B Yeats admitting that 
	Tagore's poetry was regarded with extreme contempt in Oxford during the 
	1920's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">D.H Lawrence, wrote around 1916 to 
	Ottoline Morrell (as quoted in the collected letters of D.H. Lawrence 
	pp-451-452): </font><i></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;...this fraud of looking up to 
		the East - this wretched worship of Tagore atitude - is disgusting&quot;
		</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although D.H. Lawrence was obviously 
	racially prejuduced (There's more racial tone in the elipses part, omitted 
	here), his remark about Tagore should also be viewed as one great novelist, 
	short story writer and poet's assessment of another great one, as that is 
	relevant in this context. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many renowned German poets during 
	post WWWI time were either unimpressed or dismissive of Tagore. Among them 
	were Rainer Maria Rilke, Thimas Mann,Oswald Spengler, Franz Kafka et al. 
	Spengler even declined to meet Tagore and compared him with a kitsch (German 
	for trash literature) writer called Gangeshofer! The American poet T.S Eliot 
	was totally indifferent about him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The renowned Russian novelist 
	Vladimir Nabokov of Lolita fame, said about Tagore: &quot;Why should we continue 
	to mislead students by teaching them that Mann, Galsworthy, Faulkner, Tagore 
	and Satre are &quot;great craftsmen?&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Graham Greene, in his introduction 
	to the 1937 book by R.K Narayan &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot; wrote: &quot;As for 
	Rabindranath Tagore, I cannot believe that anyone but Mr. Yeats can still 
	take his poems seriously&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now we cannot blame translation for 
	all the negative views of these celebrated poets. After all, the positive 
	views which outweighed the negative ones were also based on translations. 
	This once again points out the subjectivity factor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, the conclusion is that even if 
	the Nobel award is taken as an objective criteria of greatness, the award 
	itself is subjective at the bottom. There is no way out of this inherent 
	subjectivity. For a more detailed discussion on the issue if subjectivivity 
	and arts I refer to my essay <a href="../subjectivity_arts.html">On 
	Subjectivity in Art Appreciation</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the issue of greatness the 
	question of Tagore as a mystic/ philosopher can be raised. Many Tagore fans 
	consider him a great philosopher or a mystic. Philosopher is a very broad 
	and fuzzy notion. But in the usual sense of the word meaning one who tries 
	to understand the objective reality of entire existence by rational and 
	critical thinking, Tagore may not be a great philosopher by that criteria. 
	But he had the making of one. He had an open mind and a sense of wonder and 
	awe about life and universe. He never had any dogmatic notion on any issue. 
	He never took any decisive stand on any political issue, as he was 
	intuitively aware that there are various shades to an issue and that the 
	truth lies somewhere in between or elsewhere. That is the hallmark of a 
	philosopher. But it would be a mistake to go as far as to declare that he 
	was a great philosopher. He was some sort of mystic. There is a thin line 
	between mystics and poets. We all have an instinctual feeling of the 
	unknown, unseeable, mystical feeling. Some have the urge and the time to 
	devote lot of time meditating on it. Those who can verbalize that feeling in 
	ornamental language appeal to all of us as it evokes that latent mystical 
	feeling among us. Thus they become famous mystics. Not that they have 
	discovered or invented any new reality or truth. Mysticism is a way (through 
	poetic language) of evoking and accentuating a universal instinct of the 
	existence of a transcendal world. But language, being a closed system with a 
	finite set of vocabulary, can never express any truth about objective 
	reality, which is a continuum, an infinite set. Thats why Tagore's mention 
	the Infinite and the merging of the self with infinite does not mean 
	anything, just a Derridian narrative. But it evoked a sympathetic mystical 
	response from many. On the question of Tagore as a philosopher, Bertrand 
	Russell was quite dismissive. He wrote (in a letter to Ottoline morrell, 
	June 19,1913) after hearing Tagore's lecture on 'The realisation of 
	Brahma'(From Sadhana): </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>&quot;Here I am back from Tagore's 
		lecture, after walking most of the way home. It was unmitigated rubbish 
		- cut-and-dried conventional stuff about the river becoming one with the 
		Ocean and man becoming one with Brahma. The man is sincere and in 
		earnest but merely rattling old dry bones. I spoke to him before the 
		lecture afterwards I avoided him.&quot; </i></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Russell made further such comments 
	on Tagore. </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>'I regret I can not agree 
		with Tagore. His talk about the infinite is ague nonsense. The sort of 
		language that is admired by many Indians unfortunately does not, in 
		fact, mean any thing at all.' </i></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He said the above when asked to 
	comment on a 1912 letter Tagore sent to him (which Russell published in his 
	autobiography in 1967) praising his essay &quot;The Essence of Religion&quot;. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The attempt by some fans to ascibe a 
	profound scientific and philosophical meaning to his poetic work suffers 
	from the same flaw as in the attempt of followers of religion to ascribe the 
	same to their scriptures. The poetic words of Tagore are just expressions of 
	his subjective metaphysical feelings, not of any objective reality. As 
	Wittgenstein has said &quot;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain 
	silent&quot;. It is for this reason of non-objectivity that non-scientifc 
	metaphysics was debunked by Heidegger, Hume, Wittgenstein as pure play of 
	words, without substance or analyticity. So it is not just Tagore, but any 
	attempt by anyone of philosophising about truth in the form of dicta would 
	be rejected by rationalist philosophers like Russell. Tagore's poetry are a 
	superb example of verbal art to express aetshetic element in mystical 
	feelings, but it should not be mistook for philosophy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore fans may dismiss Russell 
	because of that. But then Russell is regarded as the premier 
	philosopher/rationalist of the 20th century, a Nobel laureate to boot. To 
	accept the dismissal of Russell by these fans would mean putting more weight 
	on these fans than Russell. At best that points out the lingering issue of 
	subjectivity in all these. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reverting to some general 
	considerations, if a critic dislikes an artist based on a view or opinion 
	about some factual content of the artist or his/her work which is either 
	true or false, then there can be a legitimate debate about such view or 
	opinion. An example would be a debate on how many songs did Tagore compose, 
	(about 2500) or a debate on whether Tagore had actually delievered his Nobel 
	acceptance speech(He did, though much later in May, 1921). And in that case 
	the debate can be settled by referring to the supporting evidences from 
	authentic sources and references. Also in that case it must be understood 
	that the truth or falsity of the view or opinion cannot change the artistic 
	appeal or value of the artist's work, because that is purely a subjective 
	perception. Art appeals to humans through its aesthetic content. The 
	aesthetic appeal of an artwork does not depend on the truth or falsity of 
	the factual content of some aspect of the art or the artist. It will be a 
	fallacy to judge an artwork or an artist based on the factual contents. The 
	factual contents can be relevant in judging the artist as a person, 
	specially if that artist also has political ambitions and takes an activist 
	stand on ethical, social and political issues. An artist is not under any 
	moral or legal obligation to do so, nor is there any moral or legal grounds 
	against taking such a stand. But if he/she chooses to take sich a stand then 
	it becomes pertinent to subject his words and deeds under scrutiny. In 
	certain instance the debate can be a grey area between purely subjective and 
	purely objective. For example is Tagore's song suitable as a national anthem 
	for Bangladesh? Some strongly feel it is, others strongly feel it is not. 
	Each side may have their own criteria to calibrate their views against and 
	justify it. But which criteria is the right one? That will defy any 
	objective answer. In the final analysis the conclusion of whether it is the 
	right or wrong choice has to be a subjective judgment of the arbiter and the 
	those the arbiter represents. Logic alone cannot settle this. In the 
	language of logic, a conclusion can be objectively right or wrong based on 
	the premises (axioms). But whether the premises (axioms) are right and wrong 
	can never be settled by logic alone. A debate where the premises (axioms) 
	are not agreed upon can never be settled. The endless bickering we see in 
	Tagore debates is due to debaters mixing up the subjective and the objective 
	aspects, not agreeing upon the premises, and trying to refute the subjective 
	aspect of each others views, which defy any resolution. The debate also 
	takes on an emotional nature, each side throwing ad hominems towards the 
	other. Focusing solely on the objective ( factual) aspects and using 
	authentic sources and references to back up their respective views would 
	have settled the debate quickly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One thing quite apparent in these 
	debates is that just as there are critics who erroneously try to judge 
	Tagore as an artist based on factual issues, similarly there are ardent 
	admirers of Tagore, who do not appreciate the fact that expressing critical 
	views about some factual aspects of Tagore does not imply a blanket 
	depreciation of Tagore as an artist. The admiration of some Tagore 
	aficionados is nothing less than a veritable apotheosis of Tagore, creating 
	a fetish or cult like aura around him, making any critical assessment of 
	Tagore a taboo, which is similar to how the religious followers treat their 
	prophets. But a truly scholarly study of Tagore cannot admit of such a blind 
	infatuation which impairs the ability to objectively see Tagore's human side 
	and recognize his foibles and limitations which he had quite a few. Again it 
	must be emphasized that pointing out the foibles and citing facts about 
	Tagore that does not accord with the view of Tagore as a perfect human does 
	not in any way imply that the critic pointing out such foibles is bigoted, 
	communal, or a Tagore basher (bashing!, sounds familiar,in a different 
	context?) It is not uncommon at all to see debates where the critic did in 
	the prolog of his essay clearly state his personal admiration for Tagore and 
	acknowledged that Tagore was one of the greatest artist, but later in the 
	debate, that clarification was completely forgotten by the Tagore fans angry 
	at the critical views of Tagore, calling the critic Tagore basher, hater, 
	communal minded etc. Yes, it is possible that some critic of Muslim origin 
	may try to point out the foibles of Tagore just because Tagore was a Hindu 
	born. Every possibility is instantiated at least once. But an astute reader 
	should be able to distinguish the critical view of Tagore motivated by such 
	communally biased attitude from that motivated by the desire for a truly 
	objective and dispassionate critique of a great artist, which is what a 
	scholarly criticism is supposed to be. A scholarly criticism may come from 
	critics of any religious origin. If an astute reader is unable to 
	distinguish the two, then they would at least give the benefit of the doubt 
	and not assume the former motivation, and only offer their counter points 
	against the critique in a professional manner. After all, a scholarly 
	critic, who would dispassionately study Tagore, and will not hesitate to 
	acknowledge his greatness as well as his foibles based on authentic sources 
	and references, can in principle be from any religious background. A case in 
	point is the authors of &quot;Myriad minded man&quot; cited earlier. But unfortunately 
	most Tagore debates eventually veer towards ad hominem attacks of the 
	critics, drawing emotional conclusion on the motivation behind the critic' s 
	views, without any objective basis for such a conclusion. There can be no 
	room for emotionalism in a purely pedagogic debate on art or literary 
	criticism. Emotionalism is more suited to a political debate where each may 
	have vested interest in supporting or opposing an ideology, a leader or a 
	party. Just because a Tagore critic may be Muslim born, does not 
	automatically imply that the critic's views are motivated by communal bias. 
	There are many Muslim born leftist/atheist critic of Tagore who could not 
	care less for the fact that they were born as a Muslim and Tagore was born 
	as a Hindu. For them (in fact for some non-leftist, non-atheist secular 
	critics as well) their critical view of Tagore is primarily based on their 
	perception of the stand and view Tagore took vis a vis the British rule and 
	independence movement against the British, his silence about class struggle 
	and his zamindari(feudal) connection through inheritance. And it is not just 
	leftists in Bangla, Hungarian Marxist critic Gyorgy Lukacs harshly 
	criticized Tagore for his novel &quot;Home and the World&quot; calling it a &quot;petit 
	beurgeos yarn of the shoddiest kind&quot;. Just after his secod lecture in 
	Beijing in 1924, some leaflets were found in the lecture hall. Among other 
	things the leaflets read: </font><i></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Tagore speaks of the 
		&quot;Heavenly Kingdom&quot;, &quot;almighty God&quot; and &quot;Soul&quot;. If these could remove us 
		from misery what would be the use of man's endevour to reform the world? 
		We oppose D. Tagore, who tries to stunt the growth of self-determination 
		snd the struggle of oppresed classes and races. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the irony of it ll is that 
	Tagore's praise of Stalin's Russia for its success in mass education made 
	some prominent Russian émigré like Rachmaninoff and Ilya Tolstoy accuse him 
	(in a letter to NY Times ) of taking an evasive attitude toward the 
	communist grave-diggers of Russia and lending thus indirectly lending 
	support toa group of professional murderers. Not a view that will be in 
	accord with the leftists who view him as reactionary. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But on the other side of the coin 
	Tagore, he did tell Izvestia interviewer before departing Russia in 1931 
	that though he was impressed by the success in mass education he asked if 
	they were doing their ideal a service by arousing in the mind anger and 
	class hatred. &quot;Freedom of mind is needed for the reception of truth; terror 
	hopelessly kills it...&quot; he told Izvestia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another motivation for critical view 
	of Tagore is possibly due to backlash against the apotheosis of Tagore by 
	his overzealous fans, in much the same way the secular critics feel moivated 
	to criticize and debunk the doctrines of religion and the prophets as a 
	backlash against the dogmatic claim of the religious followers about their 
	religion's absolute superiority and perfection. It is a common element of 
	human nature to react against claims of absoluteness or perfection and bring 
	down such claims to a mundane level. That element may be at work in the 
	critical appraisal of Tagore's foibles by some critics. It is important to 
	keep in mind this shades of various motivating factors behind Tagore's 
	criticism. So it is unfair and unprofessional to judge a critic and assign a 
	communal motive behind their criticism because of their religious origin.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us examine some popular 
	criticisms of Tagore. During the heyday of Swadeshi (Independence) movement 
	of the first two decades of 20th century in India, there were severe critics 
	of Tagore. They viewed him as imperialist hypothesizer. He was even targeted 
	for assassination in San Francisco by some radical Punjabi and Sikh elements 
	of the independence movement for his perceived &quot;pro-imperialist&quot; stand when 
	he was visiting San Francisco in 1917. The leftist intellectuals in both the 
	Banglas still today consider him a reactionary, supporting British 
	domination of India, at best not taking a decisive stand against it. It is 
	true at least in the early part Tagore did view British reign in India a 
	providential one to bring India to the age of modern science and education, 
	but later he gave up on that romantic vision, specially in view of the 
	increasingly oppressive nature of the British rulers. But on one issue he 
	was consistent throughout, he opposed any violent form of independence 
	struggle. He even viewed the non-cooperation movement of Gandhi as violent 
	or provoking violence and distanced himself from his nationalism. He was in 
	favour of cultural nationalism, not political. His emphasized focusing on 
	the positive like imparting modern education to millions of illiterate 
	Indians rather than focusing on the negative like bitterness towards the 
	British and engaging in a violent movement against the British rule. His 
	puritanic abhorrence of hatred based movement or activism was consistent. He 
	even opposed the construction of memorial for the dead in Amritsar killing, 
	as that would instill hatred in the minds of future generations, rather than 
	instill a positive and constructive feeling among them. Of course we should 
	keep in mind that he repudiated his knighthood in protest of the Amritsar 
	killings. He had for a good part of life scoffed at the idea of Swaraj 
	(Independence) of India in the state of illiteracy India was then, thinking 
	that would unleash the negative impulses of the Indians even more in the 
	absence of a constraining effect of the British. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How would this attitude of Tagore 
	fare with the supporters and fighters of liberation struggle of Bangladeshi 
	against Pakistan rule in 1971? There is some striking similarity in the two 
	cases. Anyone who might have opposed (even in thoughts) a violent struggle, 
	and emphasized focusing on improving the lot of the Bangalis, rather than a 
	hatred for Pakistan, would have been viewed as a traitor. Tagore decried 
	nationalism, which he described as &quot;the collective egoism&quot; of the people. 
	Such view is patently inconsistent with the so called liberation spirit of 
	Bangladesh of 1971 (Ekattorer Chetona) which is based primarily on Bangla 
	nationalism. Tagore also did not express any admiration for democracy. The 
	authors of Myriad Minded Man commenting on a letter by eminent French 
	orientalist Sylvan Levi to Tagore that Levi had put his accusing finger on 
	two of Tagore's most sensitive spots: is sympathy for Brahminism and 
	distrust of democracy. Tagore himself said &quot;...We ,who do not profess 
	democracy,...&quot;, in a speech in Tokyo, indirectly referring to the letter by 
	Levi and other similar criticisms against him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is one reason why SOME don't 
	accept the adoption of Tagore's song as Bangaldesh's national anthem 
	although the song does say I love my Golden Bangla, since Tagore or his 
	overall work does not project a sympathetic view of the spirit of an armed 
	struggle for liberation, which is the central theme of Bangladshi 
	independence movement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But it would be naive to pigeonhole 
	Tagore's views and words into a single category. He himself refused to be 
	cast into one mold. In a letter to his daughter Mira on December 22,1920 he 
	wrote: </font><i></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I have always been attacked by 
		poitical groups, religious groups, social groups and so on. If I beonged 
		to the opposition camp,each group would have forgiven me. That I do not 
		belong to any group makes them all angry. No one will be able to put a 
		chain around my feet&quot; </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He was truly a myriad minded man. He 
	didn't rush to a political stand on nationalistic, unless he was 100% sure 
	about it in it's entierty. He even refused to condemn Italian fascism, even 
	when requested by French poet Romain Rolland and his friend Duhamel. Only 
	much later did he indirectly criticized fascism. He may have been lenient 
	towards British rule in India for most part, but he also repudiated his 
	knighthood in protest against Amritsar killings. He openly condemned the 
	killings and torture of the political prisoners in the detention camp in 
	Hijli in 1931. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although he was never a fan of 
	nationalism, he never showed his preference to speak in English and prefered 
	to speak in Bangla instead. In mentality and dress, he was always a Bangali. 
	He mocked the Bengalis he met in England while visiting England, who were 
	trying to be English like in manners and customs. He sarcastically refered 
	to them as IngaBangas. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although he is viewed by cynics as 
	being pro-British, imperialist hypothesizer, it is also true that he himself 
	had disowned his Grandfather Dwarakanath Tagore for his commercial outlook 
	and more because he saw him as a colonialist lackey, cozying upto the East 
	India company. It would be a mistake to equate Tagore with his grandfather 
	as many cynic seems to do. It is an irony that although many Indians viewed 
	him as sympathetic to the British, many British viewed Tagore as having 
	antipathy against the British! Edward Thompson, in Tagore's biography &quot;Rabindranath 
	Tagore: The Poet and Dramatist&quot; had insinuated that Tagore had antipathy for 
	the British. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As much as he admired the good of 
	the west, advocated assimilation of modernity and synthesis of East and 
	West, he also disliked the crass commercialism of western culture (How would 
	he have felt now when tha commercialism is hundred times higher even in 
	India?). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although many cynics in both Bangla, 
	specially on the East side view Tagore as an armchair poet, out of touch 
	with the reality of ordinary folks, that view has also its limitations. 
	Tagore had alrwady pioneered an early form of micro credit in the rural 
	Bangla where he introduced an agricultural bank to extend loans to the 
	peasants to save them from heavy debt from the greedy money-lenders, himself 
	borrowing the money from banks. That is certainly not consistent with the 
	view of an armchair poet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So much mre can be said about the 
	myriad mind of Tagore, that I have to stop here with the hope of writing a 
	follow-up to cover some more aspect of his myriad mind.</font></p>
