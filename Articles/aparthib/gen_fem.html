	<p align="justify">On the occasion of the International Women's Day 2005, I 
	wrote an essay in Mukto-Mona with the title
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/aparthib/int_womens_day2005.html">
	&quot;International Women's Day - Celebrating Women's Achievements</a>&quot; in which 
	I was all gaga about the impressive list of achievements women have 
	accomplished over the years. It may have been seen as condescending by many 
	feminists to be listing women's achievement, as doing so may carry the 
	veiled implication that there was/is any doubt about women's capability. 
	That cynicism may have some justification. But the motive behind that essay 
	was to open the eyes of many men (and also women) who quite surprisingly 
	still have doubts about women possessing equal POTENTIAL as men in ALL 
	aspects of life. This time my focus will be quite different in nature. I 
	will focus on the critical views of women themselves on gender and feminism 
	issues, or some aspects thereof. In almost all essays on women or gender 
	issues, whether on the occasion of International Women's day or in other 
	context, the focus(rightly) is on the discrimination, persecution 
	perpetrated by men on women, highligting women's potentials and achievements 
	and last but not the least, on glorifying feminism. My essay as a contrarian 
	one will try to dispel some myths and mistaken perceptions about women that 
	persists among many, men and women alike. To dispel those myths and 
	misperceptions I will heavily draw on comments and views of women 
	themselves. News and factbites will also be used. I will also dwell on the 
	criticism of women against women, feminists to be precise, and on comments 
	or views by women that is usually attributed to men. It is surprising to 
	learn that much of what we call &quot;sexist view of women&quot;, is taken not just by 
	men, but by women as well. Moreover, to drive home the point that women are 
	equal to men, it is also relevant to show that women can be as bad as men, 
	not just as good as men. It would be in the true spirit of equality between 
	the sexes to do so, although in recent parlance (colloquially) &quot;bad&quot; 
	sometimes means &quot;good&quot;. So I will allow that latitude to the readers in 
	interpreting &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; in the context of gender issues. In this essay 
	I will make the point that women are equally capable of committing vices (or 
	virtues depending on the view one takes) that are normally attributed to 
	men, at least by layfolks. I cannot overemphasize the fact that the this 
	essay is not anti-women or derogatory to women, but only tries to clinch the 
	fact that men and women are really not that different after all. To avoid 
	generating male vs. female controversy, I will only quote views by women, 
	and facts from sources of either gender (facts do not depend on gender 
	anyway). </p>
	<p align="justify">The word feminism conjures up the noble idea of the 
	struggle by women against the gender based discrimination, persecution, and 
	inequity that have been perpetrated on women throughout history and 
	continues in various degrees in all societies still today. Viewed in this 
	very general and broad sense of the term feminism, all sensible people, men 
	or women are champions of &quot;feminism&quot;. After all discrimination, persecution, 
	inequity are morally wrong, regardless of whether the basis for such wrongs 
	be gender, race, language, religion whatever. Yet a 1997 poll revealed that 
	70% of women do not consider themselves as feminists although they agree 
	with every major feminist position (The exact source of this poll result 
	will be quoted later). What can explain this apparently contradictory 
	result? Feminism is not a simple unambiguous concept anymore, at least in 
	USA. There are some aspects of contemporary feminism that many women do not 
	agree with. That is why they do not wish to be identified with a blanket 
	label of feminist. </p>
	<p align="justify">Although various factions of feminism have been 
	catalogged (as in the FAQ of alt.feminism and other databases), academic 
	discussions/debates on feminism broadly divide feminism into two categories: 
	(1) Equity feminism (2) Gender Feminism (Introduced by by feminist writer 
	Christina Hoff Sommers in her book : &quot;Who Stole Feminism: How Women Have 
	Betrayed Women&quot;). The first category reflects the goal of reddressing the 
	inequities and injustices perpetrated on female gender and achieve a total 
	equality and equity between genders. Basically it is a subset of a broader 
	human rights issue, that aims to abolish all forms of injustice based on 
	race, gender etc. The second form goes beyond that and aims at proving a 
	supremacy of one gender over another, and is based on not only glorifying 
	one gender but degrading the other gender as well, in a systemic sense. This 
	dichotomy roughly corresponds to the belief in a racial equality between 
	whites and blacks as reflected in the civil liberties movement in the 60's 
	by both blacks and whites and the radical supremacist ideas of KKK and black 
	supremacist groups of that era. </p>
	<p align="justify">The reason many women are unwilling to be seen as 
	feminists as referred to in the poll above is because they have issues with 
	those aspects of gender feminism, and since the term feminism is too broad 
	and includes gender feminism, hence their uneasiness with being labelled as 
	a feminist. </p>
	<p align="justify">Anyway, back to the theme of this essay. I will list down 
	some quotes and facts in three sections (A-C) with appropriate sources from 
	books and and magazines : </p>

	<h3>A. Women on Gender and Feminism Issues:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sarah Boxer in &quot;One casualty of the women's movement: Feminism&quot;, NY 
		Times, December 14, 1997 said that most women do not consider themselves 
		as feminists (about 70% in 1997) yet they agree with every major 
		feminist position.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>In a 1975 dialog, Simon De Beauvoir said : &quot;No women should be 
		authorized to stay at home to raise her children, women should not have 
		that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women 
		will make that choice. <br>
		(From p-171,&quot;Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature&quot; by Steven 
		Pinker)
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Both Wendy Shalitt in her book &quot;A return to Modesty: Discovering the 
		lost virtue&quot; and Danielle Crittendon in her book &quot;What our mothers 
		didn't tell us: Why happiness eludes modern women&quot;, advise women &quot;to 
		marry young, postopone their careers, and care for children in 
		traditional marriages&quot; (From p-339, Blank Slate - Pinker)
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>F. Carolyn Graglia in her book &quot;Domestic tranquility: A brief 
		against Feminism&quot; theorized that women's maternal snd sexual instincts 
		are being distorted by the assertiveness and analytical mind demanded by 
		careers. (From Blank Slate - Pinker) 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Marian Kester Combs, a freelance writer for Washington Times &amp; 
		Chronicles wrote in &quot;Estrogen Poisoning&quot; in Chronicle, May, 1997 that 
		&quot;feminists are out to destroy femininity and motherhood. She contends 
		that feminism should be called masculinism as thats what the feminists 
		are trying to aquire, traits like dominance, aggression, profanity etc.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Suzanne Fields in &quot;Warriors or Damsels in Distress?&quot;, The washington 
		Times, may 19, 1997 argues against women in combat forms in military. 
		She says &quot;its a double standard of feminists to advocate such roles. 
		They(feminists) want female soldiers to be seen as too weak to stand up 
		to male superiors who harass them but strong enough to battle enemies. 
		If a woman soldier cannot kick a male soldier where it hurts when he 
		attackes her sexually, how can we expect her to protect herself, and her 
		buddies against an eneny soldier?&quot;
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From p-352-353, Blank Slate - Pinker: The article &quot;Parity as a goal 
		sparks bitter battle&quot; (C. Holden, Science, July 21, 2000, p-380) quotes 
		from a presentation at the National Academy of Engineering by social 
		scientist Patti Hausman who said that the reasons why more women don't 
		choose careers in Engineering is because they don't WANT TO. 
		<p>Patti Hausman's above observations were corroborated by Linda 
		Gottfredson who said: &quot;On average, women are more intersted in (dealing 
		with) people and men with things&quot; </p>
		<p>&quot;Glass ceiling theory has been refuted largely by women themselves, 
		like Hausman, Godfredson, Judith Klinefeld, Cathy Young, Camille Benbow, 
		economist Jennifer Roback, Felice Schwartz, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, &amp; 
		Christina Stolba, legal scholars Jennifer Braceras&quot; </p>
		<p>(My Note: Glass ceiling theory says that women face an invisible 
		barrier in climbing up the corporate ladder beyond a certain level) </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>In &quot;Women's Figures: The Economic Progress of Women in America&quot;, 
		published by American Enterprise 1996, Diana Furchtgott-Roth and 
		Christine Stolba disputes the allegation of widespread discrimination 
		and provide statistics to back it up, refers to the allegation as an 
		attempt to promote victim status of women. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Susan Au Allen, in April 1, 1997 issue of &quot;Vital Speeches of The 
		day&quot;, explains wage gap as being due to &quot;personal choices&quot;. In 1992, she 
		says that 75% of M.S. &amp; PhD in Education went to females, 86% of M.S &amp; 
		PhD in Engineering went to males. Average monthly slary for Education 
		field is $3048, and for Engineering majors is $4045, a wage gap of 
		$1001, obviously due to personal choice.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From http://www.equityfeminism.com/bookstore/ceasefire.html : 
		<p>&quot;Into this fray steps Cathy Young whose book Ceasefire argues that 
		men and women arent all that different after all and that many of the 
		problems often described in the media as mens or womens problems are, 
		in fact, problems common to all humanity regardless of sex. As Young 
		aptly puts it in the title of her first chapter, &quot;Men are from Earth, 
		Women are from Earth.&quot; That in many circles this is still a 
		fundamentally radical idea is testament to how pervasive sexual 
		stereotyping in all its varieties remains..&quot; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From http://www.taemag.com/issues/articleid.16520/article_detail.asp 
		: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;We have a system of quality control in scholarship. It is called 
			criticism. This has broken down when it comes to feminist research. 
			Scholars are not correcting the faulty research for fear of 
			appearing illiberal or &quot;sexist.&quot; This has done terrible harm 
			already.&quot; </i><br>
			( - Christina Hoff Sommers )</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>The title of the book by Christina Hoff Sommers: &quot;The War Against 
		Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men&quot; says it all, no 
		quote is needed.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Daphne Patai writes in the introduction &quot;Redefining the World&quot; of 
		her book &quot;Heterophobia: Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism&quot;: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Women claim to be equal partners when that suits them, and claim 
			to be entitled to special consideration when that suits them.&quot; </i>
		</blockquote>
		&quot;They insist on autonomy in maintaining or aborting pregnancies, but at 
		the same time they determine the fathers' duties -- and rights, if any. 
		Women claim child support. They can either demand or impede fathers' 
		continuing involvement with their offspring, as the women see fit. [Do 
		men have any reproductive rights?] The result is that women have 
		advantages over men in child custody suits, having learned to use the 
		legal system to readily get protection orders against men (on the 
		flimsiest provocation) when that suits their purposes, just as they have 
		learned to use charges of child sexual abuse and domestic violence.&quot; 
		<p>(According to the editorial board of the publisher, Heterophobia is 
		&quot;A devastating expose of the way academic feminists are driving their 
		wedge between men and women.&quot;) </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From pages 409-410, &quot;Sex: A Natural History&quot; by Joan Allen Rodgers: 
		<p>&quot;For one thing most men do not rape or beat their wives. For another, 
		women under certain - but rarely sexual circumstances are equally or 
		more violent toward spouses that are men. &quot;But the facts are that half 
		of all spousal murders in US are committed by wives and not all of them 
		are in response to physical abuse by men. The 1985 National Family 
		Violence Surevy supported by the National Institute of mental health 
		shows that women and men are physically abusing each other in roughly 
		equal numbers, and that women often use weapons to make up for their 
		relative physical advanatge. A study on family violence published in 
		1986 in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that 1.8 million women 
		assaulted by husbands and boyfriends, but 2 million men were assaulted 
		by wife or girlfriend. The study also found that mothers abuse their 
		children twice as often as do fathers in some surveys, and one reason 
		this seems so shocking is because men who are taught to be manly are 
		terrified to admit they have been abused by women, so their numbers are 
		vastly underrated.&quot; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Elinor Buckett in &quot;The Right Women&quot; (1998) says feminist movement is 
		over (Since it has succeeded) and says its no longer bought by majority 
		women anymore. Women are not oppressed as the feminists clamour. She 
		says signs of victory are all over. In newspapers,.. Women's rejection 
		of feminism should not be a cause of dismay, it should be a cause of 
		celebration. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Mona Charen in Women's Quarterly, Spring '98 writes against 
		feminists view and contends that biology is repsonsible for gender 
		traits, not culture. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>It was a woman political activist Phyllis Schlafly who formed a 
		foundation called stop the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment)! In her book, 
		&quot;The Power of Positive Woman&quot; she argues that women are not prepared to 
		handle equal responsibility as men as they are not as strong as men and 
		they cannot afford to lose the protective labor laws favouring women 
		that would disappear if ERA was passed. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>It is an irony that ERA has never been passed due to lack of 
		non-ratification by majority US states even though it was passed by a 
		male majority congress! Even women suffrage, which was passed in 1920 
		was opposed by a woman, Phyllis Bissell, a social reformer and lecturer. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Marianne Williamson in her book &quot;Women's Worth&quot;, p-63 says &quot;Most of 
		us want a masculine man, but there's no way to have one unless we become 
		feminine woman&quot;.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Then there are some women on the extreme end of the spectrum, who 
		are inspired by Biblical passages and sincerely believe that happiness 
		in marriage can only come through submission of wives to their husbands! 
		Christina McClelland wrote in the Moody magazine (July/August 1998 
		issue) titled &quot;The Ugly 'S' word&quot; quoting biblical passages and citing 
		her own happy marriage argued that submitting to the husband is the best 
		guarantee for peace in the house. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From Newsweek February 14, 2005 (In Letters section): 
		<p>I AM TIRED OF HEARING WOMEN IN THE sciences whine, I am a Ph.D 
		precandidate in atmospheric oceanic and space sciences fully funded with 
		tuition and a stipend at the University of Michigan, while my husband is 
		struggling financially to acquire his master's degree in mechanical 
		engineering, course by course, because no one will fund him. I am the 
		one being handed opportunities, in part because I am a woman. Many women 
		who feel victimized by sexism in the sciences could use my circumstances 
		as evidence that some women are given a break in order to get ahead, But 
		by this rationale, my credibility will be challenged by those who assume 
		I receive funding because I am a woman, not because of any measure of 
		intelligence. I have worked. very hard to get where I am, and am 
		continuing to work harder than I ever thought I could as I proceed with 
		my research and work toward my goal of achieving tenure at a prominent 
		unversity. I do not find and have not ever found my gender to be a 
		reason to whine. <br>
		- Emily Mae Chistianson,Ann Arbor,Michigan </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-89 of &quot;Women's Worth&quot;, author Marianne Williamson: &quot;We don't 
		think about being kind and caring, we think about how we can hook a man. 
		We don't think about his fears and problems, we think of our own and how 
		we can get him to solve them. We don't think about him period - but 
		about his money, his job, or his connections.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-124 of Anatomy of Love - Fisher: &quot;Women are more interested in 
		the status of a potential lover than his physical appearance.&quot;

		<li>p-124, Deborah Blum, in &quot;Sex on the Brain&quot;: &quot;Monogamy requires fair 
		and equal partnership. The stereotype &quot;Men breadwinner, women as

		<li>On p-117, Sex: A natural History : &quot;Women have diffuse brain 
		organization, in which some of the language capability reside on the 
		right as well, as a result her feelings flow into words, his are clogged 
		in the left brain. He feels the same feeling, he just can't get them out 
		so easily.&quot;
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-255, Sex on the Brain, Deborah Blum: Women are far more likely 
		to &quot;nuke&quot; a strong woman than a man is, says psychologist Laurie Reidman 
		of University of Minnesota.
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-17, The Manipulated Man - Esther Vilar: &quot;It is true that women

		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>p-18, Vilar (Op cit): 
		<p>&quot;But In our time women are no longer subject to the will of men. 
		Quite the contrary. They have been given every opportunity to win their 
		independence and if, after all this time, they have not liberated 
		themselves and thrown off their shackles, we can only arrive at one 
		conclusion; there are no shackles to throw off.&quot; (Note: Vilar's book was

	<h3>B. News and views of women exploding the myth of women's innocence:</h3>
	<ol>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<li>Patricia Pearson in her book &quot;When She Was Bad : Violent Women &amp; the 
		Myth of Innocence&quot; refutes the innocent image of women and exposes the 
		dark side of women. Here is an excerpt from Amazon's editorial review: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Women commit the majority of child homicides in the United 
			States; more than 80 percent of neonaticides; an equal or greater 
			share of severe physical child abuse; an equal rate of spousal 
			assault; about a quarter of child sexual molestations; and a large 
			proportion of elder abuse...The rate at which infants are murdered 
			by women in the U.S. is higher than the rate at which women are 
			murdered by men.&quot; With carefully researched facts, fascinating case 
			histories, and incisive argument, Patricia Pearson succeeds in 
			demolishing the myth that women are not naturally violent.&quot; </i>
		</blockquote>
		Larissa MacFarquhar wrote about the book in The New Yorker: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>She is a good reporter, and--no doubt in anticipation of 
			conventional feminist objections--she has done the work necessary to 
			back up even her most inflammatory ideas. 
		</blockquote>
		</i>Quote from the book: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Women can operate the system to their advantage. Donning the 
			feminine mask, they can manipulate the biases of family and 
			community  in order to set men up. If he tries to leave, or fight 
			back, a fateful moment comes when she reaches for the phone, dials 
			911, and has him arrested on the strength of her word: &quot;Officer, he 
			hit me.&quot;(p.142) </i>
		</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>Journalist Kate Fillion wrote two books refuting some myths about 
		female superiority in many aspects. Her book &quot;Lip Service: The Truth 
		About Women's Darker Side in Love, Sex and Friendship&quot; was a best 
		seller. Here is an excerpt from the editorial review: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Most of us are so accustomed to thinking of women and men as 
			psychological opposites that we don't even notice that our actual 
			experiences contradict our beliefs.&quot; With this powerful 
			introduction, Kate Fillion launches Lip Service, the #1 bestseller 
			that explodes the myth of female virtue. Women are not morally 
			superior to men, she argues, nor should they want to be.&quot; </i>
		</blockquote>
		In her other book &quot;Lip Service: The Myth of Female Virtue in Love, Sex, 
		and Friendship&quot; Kate Fillion tries to explode some more myths. Here is 
		an excerpt from the editorial review by Donna Seaman: 
		<blockquote>
			<i>Journalist Fillion believes that we would all be much better off 
			emotionally and culturally if we would stop paying lip service to 
			that stale old myth about men and women being psychological 
			opposites. According to our society's &quot;sexual script,&quot; women are the 
			&quot;intimacy experts,&quot; adept at communicating and at love, hence 
			morally superior. Men, by contrast, are reticent to a fault and 
			reluctant to forge relationships. These absurd generalizations, 
			Fillion argues, have become &quot;barriers to equality.&quot; In an attempt to 
			dismantle them, Fillion interviewed more than 100 women and men 
			about everything from friendships to relationships, fantasies, 
			sexual harassment, and the difference between rape and unwanted 
			sex...This dose of reality is a healthy alternative to books, for 
			instance, that describe men and women as creatures from different 
			planets. As far as we know, we're all earthlings, splendid in our 
			diversity.&quot; </i>

	<h3>C. Women on Female Sexuality:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>On p-93, of Anatomy of Love - Helen Fisher: &quot;All these data 
		certainly lead one to suspect that women avail themselves of illicit 
		lovers with relish, perhaps even as avidly as men&quot;
		<p>On p-94 of Fisher(op cit) : &quot;You may wish to argue that these women 
		(and women in many other cultures) all engaged in prostitution for 
		purely economic reasons. But many say they like the sexual variety. And 
		the women who pursue this vocation are not alone. The animal kingdom is 
		rife with loose females.&quot; </p>
		<p>On p-95 of Fisher(op cit): &quot;There is no evidence whatsoever that 
		women are sexually shy or that they shun clandestine sexual adventures. 
		Instead both men and women seem to exhibit a mixed reproductive 
		strategy: Monogamy and adultery are our fare&quot; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From p-122 of &quot;What's Love got to do with it?&quot; by Meredith Small: 
		<p>&quot;The difference between men and women in sexuality is not natural, 
		i.e it is not true that men are genetically coded to have more sex than 
		women, but simply a product of sexual repression by males, a policy that 
		developed to control paternity ; without repression women would 
		presumably have sex as often and with as many partners as men&quot; </p>
		<p>Meredith Small, op cit : &quot;Women would be as interested in sex had 
		they not had to fear a male stranger.&quot; </p>
		<p>On p-157, Meredith Small(op cit): &quot;In the short term, when women have 
		the opportunity and freedom, I maintain that women are just as 
		interested in sexual partners, and frequent sex, as men&quot;. &quot;both men and 
		women compromise between two conflicting impulses.&quot; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Daylle Deanna Schwartz, in her book &quot;All men are Jerks until proven 
		otherwise&quot;, p-93 says: 
		<p>&quot;Although women may hesitate to admit it, many of us love sex far 
		more than just the emotional gratification. Our reluctance to 
		acknowledge the basic natural pleasure is related to messages that have 
		taught us that its unladylike to enjoy sex too much&quot; </li>
		<li>On p-352 of her book &quot;Sex: A natural History&quot;, Joan Rodgers says:
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Every sexual anthropologist, from Alfred Kinsey to Helen Fisher, 
			has concluded that given a level social playing field and absence of 
			severe punishment, women, not men are the promiscuous sex, seeking 
			variety. 
		</blockquote>
		</i>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-381 of Sex: A natural History : &quot;April Gorry of UCSB conducted 
		studies of female white tourists (sex tourism) in Carribbean found that 
		women were more promiscuous there, choosing men of lower status than 
		themselves, prioritizing male appearance etc. 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>On p-174 of &quot;Female Sexuality&quot; by Marie Bonaparte : &quot;there is a 
		slight masochism in women, which impels her to welcome and to value some 
		measure of brutality on the man's part.&quot; 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>In her book &quot;The Psychology of Women&quot; (Two volumes) Helene Deutsch 
		says : 
		<blockquote>
			<i>&quot;Masochism, narcissism, and passivity are the three key 
			characteristics of the female personality.&quot; 
		</blockquote>
		</i>(an entire chapter is devoted to female masochism) 
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>From pages 79-80 of &quot;Sex: A Natural History&quot; by Joan Allen of 
		Rodgers: &quot;Survey shows that women disapproves casual sex far more than 
		men, but still participate in it, a double standard that belies the 
		biological roots of our stone age ancestors and is perhaps a frustrated 
		bow to social conventions and male dominated social structures.
		<p>... &quot;After all, in evolutionary terms, women, at least in developed 
		world, have just as many resources or access to resources as men 
		nowadays.&quot; </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Quotes From Promiscuities by Naomi Wolf : 
		<p>p -xxvi : &quot;But anatomists and sex educators over the last 30 years 
		hagve found more and more evidence that women are not only designed 
		anatomically to be at least as sexually intense as men - but even that 
		women's capacity for pleasure is extreme in a way we have yet to accept&quot;
		</p>
		<p>&quot;That the male gender is more driven by lust - is a fairly recent 
		historical invention. For most of recorded history, women's status as 
		the more carnal sex was pretty much granted, so much so that women's 
		presumed carnality was used to justify their persecution&quot; </p>
		<p>p-187: Hopi (Pueblos of N. Arizona) women dance naked ceremony. Clay 
		phalluses then inciting men to passion and then to love making. Refers 
		to Gutirrez: &quot;When Jesus came, the corn mothers ran away&quot; </li>
