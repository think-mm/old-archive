	Election Debate</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000" size="4">By <a href="index.html">Aparthib</a> </font></b></p>
  <p align="justify">A lot has been said and debated in this and other forums on 
	the cause and the significance of the results of recent US elections. Now 
	that the post election debate on the results of election have subsided, it 
	may be an opportune time for a postmortem of the post election debate, i.e a 
	postmortem of the postmortem of the election. I wish to take a critical look 
	at many of the views expressed by various schools of thoughts and 
	affiliations among both the secular liberals and pro-religious 
	conservatives. I may not be able to cite exact quotes, as I haven't compiled 
	all those views, but hopefully I will paraphrase their views fairly 
	accurately. </p>
	<p align="justify">One secular liberal school is hailing the result as a 
	major victory in the struggle against religious extremism. They equate 
	Bush's invasion of Iraq = A fight to destroy Islamic terrorism. Seems like 
	they have joined the with majority of US public in believing or buying into 
	claim that Saddam = AL Quaida/9-11. The fact is that: (A) There was no such 
	connection. And this fact is not just the opinion of the so called liberals.
	<i>We can take the opinion of Craig Winn whom people know by now as a 
	staunch critic of Islam, no less vocal or meticulous than Ali Sina, if not 
	more, whose book &quot;Prophet of Doom&quot; has been demanded to be banned by Islamic 
	groups and his life threatened. Craig Winn in his open letter to Bush wrote 
	: </i></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">&quot;We now know that Saddam's regime wasn't involved in 
		9/11 and that it wasn't a clear and present danger to America. So your 
		reasons for invading must have been personal and political, not 
		defensive&quot; <i>(Link:
		<a href="http://www.prophetofdoom.net/openletter.html">
		http://www.prophetofdoom.net/openletter.html</a> ) </i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify">(B) Sadam's regime, albeit a cruel dictatorship (Which US 
	never had any problem with) was secular, totally opposed to religious 
	extremism (That's why Bin Laden hated him so much, calling him infidel and 
	in his latest TV appearance just before US election said that US had 
	replaced one lackey, i.e. Saddam to install another, i.e Alawi), </p>
	<p align="justify">(C) Saddam never showed a direct hostile attitude towards 
	US. Whatever anger he showed after getting severe lashing by US for 13 years 
	was amazingly subdued compared to the ferocity of US hostility toward Iraq 
	(Sanctions, bombing etc) and </p>
	<p align="justify">(D) It was the family of Saud who had been funding and 
	aiding the Islamic extremists, but Bush administration instead of taking on 
	the Saudis (In contradiction with the stated stand that anyone aiding or 
	abetting the terrorists are also terrorists) had been very accommodating to 
	the Saudis. The same can be said to Pakistan, </p>
	<p align="justify">(E) If destroying AL-Quaida and capturing Bin Laden was 
	the top priority, then US could have done it at a fraction of the cost (in 
	terms of money and lives lost) when US surrounded Bin Laden and his 
	followers in the caves of <i>Tora Bora</i>. If 100s of thousands of Iraqi 
	civilians is worthy of killing to ensure that the insurgents hiding among 
	them are guaranteed to be killed, then there should have been much less 
	ethical or strategic problem in carpet bombing the Tora Bora cave (Where 
	mostly Bin Laden and his followers were hiding) to get rid of Bin Laden and 
	his followers in matters of hours if not minutes. But US simply decided not 
	to pursue seriously the world leader of Islamic extremists who committed the 
	9/11 11 acts (by his own admission in the tape), but instead diverted all 
	the energy and resources toward a ruthless secular dictator who headed a 
	country with great strategic interest for US and finally </p>
	<p align="justify">(F) The invasion of Iraq has rather provided an 
	ideological boost for the Islamic extremists to rally against US in Iraq, 
	where there was no Islamic terrorist activity. </p>
	<p align="justify">There is no objective reason to assign lesser score to 
	Kerry than Bush in the war against terrorism. One does not have to be 
	partisan to see this, although one can be partisan despite seeing this (Hope 
	reader can get this subtle difference). Kerry and Clinton are not very 
	different in their stand against terrorism. Clinton is given credit to have 
	prevented the millennium plan (Bojinka project) for terrorism in 2000. The 
	fact that acts like 9/11 could happen after nine months of Bush in power 
	(Nine months is a long time to prepare against terrorism if it was taken 
	seriously as a real possibility, which should have been the case, given the 
	lessons from Bojinka plan). Since Kerry and Clinton are not too different in 
	their worldview there is no reason to believe US under Kerry would be much 
	different from US under Clinton as far as war on terrorism. </p>
	<p align="justify">Given all the above facts, it is a bit of a stretch to 
	label Bush's victory as a step forward in fight against terrorism. True, US 
	has been successful in destroying Saddam and Iraqi infrastructure by 
	invading Iraq, but not in targeting the real perpetrators and the abettors 
	of 9/11 and not in fighting the Wahabbi influence (The ideological root of 
	religious terrorism) in the world including in US. Kerry may have been 
	ambivalent and contradictory on his Iraq stand (Although hair splitting 
	argument can provide wiggle room to counter such characterization in 90% 
	cases), but certainly he has not been any weaker or indecisive on his stand 
	against the real root of terrorism. </p>
	<p align="justify">We can indulge in a thought experiment. We can imagine 
	that Kerry was the president during the 9/11 incident. There is no reason to 
	believe that there would not have been any action by US in Afghanistan 
	against Al-Quaida, whether or not Kerry would have successful in rooting out 
	terrorism, this school of secular liberals would have equated Kerry = USA 
	and would have labeled any criticism of Kerry as weak on terrorism. There is 
	nothing absolute or objective about the views of this school of secular 
	liberals supporting Bush vis a vis war on terrorism. Incumbency does add a 
	significant factor in shaping perception. Add to that a strong (yet 
	misdirected) action against Iraq which created a illusion of war against 
	terrorism. </p>
	<p align="justify">Now a second aspect of the post election debate. Some 
	secular liberals have opined that the Iraq policy of Bush is one inspired by 
	and Bush's victory is mainly due the influence of Christian fundamentalism. 
	That is a conclusion with very little logical basis. The main architects of 
	Iraq invasion known as the neocons, were planning this long before Bush came 
	to power. They just convinced Bush enough (Just as they convinced Clinton to 
	launch a Tomohawk missile on Iraq in 1998 and impose a permanent &amp; ruthless 
	sanction against Iraq). The neocons are not really Christian 
	fundamentalists. Many of them have quite liberal background and Harvard 
	educated. They just have a very pro-active strategic agenda for global US 
	influence (specially in the oil rich Middle East arena). Many traditional 
	republican conservatives like Pat Buchanan, Geroge McGovern etc had opposed 
	both Iraq invasion (I &amp; II) and are not sympathetic towards the neocon world 
	agenda. In fact Pat Buchanan even thinks that the Neocons would even prefer 
	Kerry over old conservatives like himself, because to them even Kerry is 
	more Hawkish (thus closer to their agenda) than the traditional conservative 
	republicans. (See :
	<a href="http://www.theamericancause.org/patgoingback.htm">
	http://www.theamericancause.org/patgoingback.htm</a>&nbsp; ) Many church 
	organizations have also expressed concern about the Iraq policy of Bush 
	administration and have expressed fear about a civilizational clash. Even 
	Pat Robertson has expressed reservation about Iraq attack. Contrast that 
	with the Hawkish attitude of much less conservative (in the traditional 
	sense) people like Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle et alia. So Iraq policy can 
	not be sweepingly categorized as a conservative or Christian fundamentalist 
	inspired agenda. Bush may have become personally more religious, but the US 
	policy is guided by practical factors, not by any ideological hatred for any 
	religion. Of course we can all agree that a powerful segment of Christian 
	fundamentalists have endorsed Bush because they see that Bush would be more 
	accommodating to their social view on abortion, gays, creationism etc, and 
	Bush welcomed their endorsement (And why not, it doesn't hurt to get some 
	extra votes to come to power). Had the Christian fundamentalists endorsed 
	Kerry (hypothetically say, reflecting the pacifist stand of many Christian 
	church), Kerry would also have welcomed them. In politics support from 
	anyone, irrespective of ideology or principle is welcome if it helps to come 
	to power. A good analogy is right in our own backyard, where BNP and AL both 
	had curried favor with Jamat to gain power, although AL tried it first, BNP 
	tried it with a vengeance and did a much better job. </p>
	<p align="justify">As regards the role of Christian fundamentalism in Bush's 
	victory, that also has been amplified. Many traditional conservatives and 
	church goers have voted against Bush. There had been groups like Relatives 
	of Bush against Bush before the election. After the election the main factor 
	was identified as voters placing moral values on top. It would be a mistake 
	to equate many people's view against abortion and gay marriage as Christian 
	fundamentalist. A good number of public who hold a moral stand against 
	abortion rights or gay marriage are not necessarily church goers or 
	fundamentalist Christian. Majority of churches in USA did not go on the 
	field exhorting rural folks to vote for Bush to preserve moral values. 
	Rather it was the Republican strategists, people like Karl Rove who did the 
	psychological maneuvering to influence public's perception and exploiting 
	their concern about their traditional moral values being threatened under 
	Kerry. Again an analogy from Bangladesh would be if some shrewd BNP 
	strategist (Not a Mullah) can convince the public that voting for AL means 
	voting for vice, immorality, against religion, then ordinary mass who are 
	not Islamic fundamentalist would vote against AL, similar to many ordinary 
	Americans far from urban area voting against Kerry. But now that Bush has 
	won, the Christian fundamentalists will be certainly have more influence on 
	republican party just as Jamat has exerted there influence of BNP after BNP 
	victory. One ominous side effect of that Christian fundamentalist influence 
	is already visible in the case of a school curriculum placing a sticker of 
	&quot;Just another theory, not a fact&quot; sticker on evolution in text books. </p>
	<p align="justify">Some secular liberals have expressed the view in chorus 
	with the pro-Islamic camp that Bush's policy is against Muslims or Islam. A 
	recent post in Mukto-Mona forum reflected that view. That view is also 
	erroneous in my opinion. In fact many other secular liberals have accused US 
	(i.e Bush) him of being too soft to the Wahbbist lobby in US and worldwide. 
	Even Craig Winn accused Bush of not taking Islamic threat seriously, (Read 
	the link cited earlier). Some have accused US of being too kind to Jamatis 
	in Bangladesh. Saudi Arabia,Pakistan have been in the favoured list of Bush, 
	despite they both being the stronghold of Islamic ideology and Islamic 
	extremists. If Bush's focus was against Islam and Muslim, then hundreds of 
	billions of dollars would not have been spent on secular Iraq, who kept the 
	Islamic fundamentalists at bay. Rather Bush would have targeted KSA, 
	Pakistan, Sudan and Iran, ruled by Islamic clergies and who unlike Iraq, 
	have track record of harboring Islamic terrorists. By the way if Bush was 
	primarily guided by anti-Islamic/anti-Muslim view, the Sudan would have been 
	the first target, Sudanes theocrats have been very cruel towards Christians, 
	aided Jihadists, but US had no problem with Sudan's rulers, and has condoned 
	all their acts. </p>
	<p align="justify">Even in Iraq, US had welcomed the rise of the religious 
	groups banned under Saddam. I can't find any logic for getting rid of a 
	secular dictator and welcoming/tolerating orthodox Islamic groups if they 
	were intrinsically anti-Islamic or anti-Muslim. If you are anti-someone you 
	destroy them just as Stalin, Mao or Hitler did, they tried to annihilate 
	those they were anti. I may have simplified and glossed over many issues, 
	but my aim was to present some general counterpoints in the critique of some 
	simplistic views on the issue.</p>
