  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today (March 8) is International 
	women's day (IWD). First, some brief historical note. The first IWD was 
	observed on March 19, 1911 in Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, 
	pursuant to a decision taken at Copenhagen the previous year by <i>The 
	Socialist International</i> to establish an international day for Women, to 
	honour the movement for women's rights and to assist in achieving universal 
	suffrage for women. No date was specified in the Copenhagen declaration. 
	Since then, IWD was observed on last Sunday of February each year until 
	1917. In Russia where Julian calendar was used, the last Sunday of February 
	1917 fell on March 8 according to Gregorian calendar. Russian women chose 
	that day to strike for &quot;bread and peace&quot;. Their strike contributed among 
	other factors, to the fall of Czar four days later. Since that time IWD 
	began to be observed on March 8 every year. The date was made official in 
	1921 for universal observance as International Women's day all over the 
	world at the suggestion of the Bulgarian delegates at the 1921 Socialist 
	International meeting. On the eve of this IWD, I just wish to mention the 
	accomplishments of some international women in areas that were (and still is 
	to a great extent) exclusively male dominated, that should be a source of 
	inspiration to Bangla women. Although much of the lack of substantial 
	achievement of Bangla women in many areas that are exclusive to men is due 
	to hostile social attitude, part of the reason is also that many women 
	themselves have been conditioned by ingrained social attitude to believe 
	that its not proper for women to go into those professions. Its good to see 
	that against all the odds (specially due to religious conservatism), women 
	are still making headway. The very fact I have to cite women's achievement 
	to prove that they are not inherently less capable points to the problem of 
	the ingrained stereotype that persists. In a way one could argue it is the 
	burden of those who think women are inferior to back up their claim rather 
	than the reverse. True, but it is also true that by citing these 
	achievements may serve as eye openers for some who choose keep their eyes 
	closed and not budge from their ingrained view of women's supposed 
	inferiority unless provoked by these eye opening factual data. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me cite some inspiring 
	historical facts on women's ability and then move on to more recent times.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Women have displayed gallantry no 
	less impressive then that of men. In our own subcontinent we have read the 
	story of Sultana Razia, daugfhter of Iltutmis, who ascended the throne in 
	Delhi in 1236 AD amidst fierce opposition by men against women's rule, but 
	was appointed nevertheless by them due to total misrule by her incompetenet 
	brother Rukanuddin, who inherited the throne even though Iltutmis had chosen 
	Razia as his successor. Razia unlike her brother showed remarkable skill and 
	foresight in managing Delhi's throne. Sadly she was killed in a conspiracy 
	by her ministers during and after her attempt to quel a rebellion by Altunia, 
	ruler of the province of Sarhind (who she later married). </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Much later we read the story of 
	Lakkhi (Laxmi) Bai, the queen of Jhansi (in Madhya Pradesh). She bravely 
	resisted the invasion of Lord Dalhousie's British army, and led her rebel 
	troops against him, making the supreme sacrifice in the battle (in 1858).
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In our own Bangla/Bengal we read 
	about the bravery of Pritilota Waddedar (1911-1932), Surja Sen's able 
	companion rebel in the insurgency against the colonial British. Not many 
	know that she also earned a BA degree with distinction from Calcutta (Kolkata) 
	University in 1932 and was appointed the headmistress of Nanda Kanan school 
	in Chittagong at the young age of 22. Most know about her famous attack of 
	the European Club in Pahartoli(Chittagong) on September 4, 1932. She 
	committed suicide by cyanide poisoning during that attack. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Much earlier, The Zenata Berber 
	tribe, led by the woman Kahina (prophetess) in North Africa defeated the 
	Muslim Army led by General Hassan Ibn Naaman during Umayyad Caliph Abdul 
	Malik Ibn Merwan in 695 AD. I am sure there are many more historical facts 
	about women's bravery besides the few I cited. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now to modern times. It was a great 
	first for Bangla women to join the army around the time of last year's IWD. 
	They are yet to join as sailors and airmen (may be a new word airperson 
	should be coined) in navy and air force respectively. We had Yasmeen, a 
	female DC-10 captain of Bangladesh Biman (Airlines) , probably the 
	first/only in Asia at that time (in the mid 80's). Unfortunately her career 
	was cut short due to political reasons prematurely. It is also unfortunate 
	that the two female pilots who were going to become Yasmeen's successor were 
	both killed in accidents while as co-pilots or in training as pilots. We 
	know of another female Biman airbus captain in the making, Tania Reza. I am 
	not sure if there is any other women in flying crew anymore in Biman. I 
	don't think we yet have a female captain/co-captain of a merchant or naval 
	ship, a female helicopter, transport or fighter pilot yet. Someone may 
	correct me if I am wrong. Do we have any woman bus/ truck/train/launch 
	drivers in Bangladesh yet? I don't think so. We know in the West and 
	possibly in Asia (certainly there are women bus conductors in Bangkok) there 
	are women in all those professions. In the context of Bangladesh, the name 
	of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/aparthib/papiya.gif">Papiya</a> must be 
	mentioned. She was the first (Sadly, may be the last, if the present trend 
	is any indicator) to dare to try to earn a living by pulling a Rickshaw in 
	Dhaka city. She carried male passengers too, not just female. Her story was 
	covered by Daily Star reporter Shehab Ahmed under the title &quot;Tale of a 
	Courageous Girl&quot;, probably between 1997-9, I am not sure about the date. I 
	managed to scan the report and saved it in my web site. One can look at it 
	at: </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<img src="http://www.geocities.com/aparthib/papiya.gif" width="555" height="495"></p>
&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Anyway, let me mention some 
	international women who have achieved great success in such male-exclusive 
	domains, who may provide a source of inspirations to Bangla women. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The toughest, riskiest job for any 
	human in terms of skill and knowledge is known to be commanding a space 
	shuttle. Commander Eileen Collins has demonstrated that she can do that (And 
	to think that I feel scared every time I get aboard an airplne!). The 
	intellectually toughest field to excel is in superstring theory of 
	theoretical physics. This field holds the promise for the ultimate theory of 
	everything. Even noble Laureate physicist Weinberg is intimidated by its 
	formidable mathematical complexity. And here we have young
	<a href="http://www.superstringtheory.com/people/evas.html">Eva Silverstein</a>, 
	an authority on Superstring theory, besides other women like Lisa 
	Randall (Read an
	<a href="http://www.esi-topics.com/brane/interviews/DrLisaRandall.html">
	interview</a> with Lisa Randall) and
	<a href="http://www.phys.psu.edu/people/display/index.html?person_id=22&mode=research&research_description_id=91">
	Shyamoli Chaudhuri</a> (Asst Prof of Physics, Penn State University, at 
	least until 2001). Before Superstring theory was developed, Theoretical High 
	Energy Physics was considered to be the intellectually most challenging 
	field. And there we had Chinese female Nobel laureate Wu. One of the 
	toughest physically challenging job is that of an astronaut. Besides so many 
	American women astronauts, we had Indian born Kalpana Chawla, who lost her 
	life prematurely in the tragic Columbia disaster. She was not only a Nasa 
	astronaut scoring 252 orbits around the earth, but a PhD as well. Shannon 
	Lucid, another women astronaut with a PhD had the record for being longest 
	in space. Then we have Jennifer Harris, the mission manager for Sojourner 
	Pathfinder (Robot landing on Mars). </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On 18th May 1953, American 
	Jacqueline Cochran, aboard an F-86 Sabre jet, became the first woman to 
	break the sound barrier. Today an F-86 may be a dinosaur, but it was the 
	state of the art fighter in the 40's and early 50's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I always feel a sense of awe 
	everytime I fly on a Boeing-747 airplane. I wonder how challenging it must 
	be to be in command of such a behemoth of a plane. Commanding a 747 jumbo 
	jet seems to be a picnic for Susan Darcy, the first women to become a 
	full-fledged captain of a 747 in 1989. She also was the first woman to 
	become a full captain of the most sophisticated and computerized Boeing-777 
	in 1995. Darcy was also the lead pilot on the final Boeing 777-200 to enter 
	flight testing. Earler to this, she also achieved captain status on the 
	Boeing 737 in 1987 and 757/767 in 1989. Darcy is cross-trained as an 
	instructor on the 737, 757, 767, 747-400 and 777 airplanes. She has done 
	flight instruction as well as flight testing in the United States, Europe 
	and Asia. Now how many men pilots can claim such impressive series of 
	accomplishments? (On a different note,Darcy is very attractive looking, 
	debunking the popular adage, often said humorously, but sometimes seriously, 
	that the smartest women are the least attractive looking!) </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Out of about 131 cruise ships 3 are 
	captained by women (Data from year 2000, from a program on cruise ships on 
	Discovery channel). Although revealing a glaring gender disparity, the very 
	fact that such large and sophisticated cruise ships ARE being manned (rather 
	womanned!) by females testifies to the fact that no area is outside of 
	women's capability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here's an inspiring historical 
	anecdote of Amalie Noether (Physics savvy folks should know about Noether's 
	theorem, one of the most profound theorems in Physics, with deep 
	philosophical implications). The anecdote is taken from p-572, &quot;Superstrings 
	and other things&quot; by Carlos Calle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Amalie Noether, got her PhD with 
	Summa Cum Lauda from all male university of Erlangen in 1907. She was not 
	accepted at the university of Gottingen to work on Einstein's General Theory 
	of Relativity. Professor Hilbert, the lone contrarian among the faculty, 
	however allowed her to lecture in his class arguing that why should gender 
	be an argument against admissiom?. We are a university, not a bathing 
	establishment, he argued!. She was finally admitted as an instructor in 
	1919. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another women scientist Barbara 
	McClintock discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposon">
	transposons</a> (&quot;Jumping gene&quot;) in corn in the 40's, but got the 
	recognition and Nobel prize for it in 1983 when she was 81! She got her PhD 
	from Cornell in 1927 but remoianed unemployed for many years due to gender 
	discrimination. Finally she got employed in Cold Springs Harbour 
	Laboratories and scientists finally recognized the importance of her work in 
	the 40's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who have minimum interest in 
	astronomy must have read about
	<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/dict_jp.html#pulsar">pulsars</a>, 
	the pulsating neutron stars sending out bursts of radio energy in a rhythmic 
	fasion. It was radio astronomer Susan Jocelyn Bell (b. 1943) in Cavendish 
	Laboratory of Cambridge, who discovered the first pulsar in 1967 using a 
	radio telescope that she built under the supervision of Antony Hewish. The 
	scifi craze that her discovery generated were reflected in the British TV 
	serials and movies in the late 60's and early 70's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although Bell is credited to above 
	discovered pulsars, It was Sir Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish, from the 
	Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England, who were jointly awarded the 
	Nobel Prize in physics, with Hewish honored for the discovery of pulsars In 
	1967. The Nobel Prize announcement triggered a public controversy. Sir Fred 
	Hoyle, the eminent British astronomer, argued that Bell Burnell should have 
	shared the Nobel Prize. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who takes minimum interest in 
	astronomy or popular science must also have heard of
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Dark Matter</a> as well. 
	It was Vera Rubin whose measurement of the orbital velocities of 
	interstellar matter and their variation with distance from the center of the 
	galaxy (Ranging from 1970 to mid 80's) conclusively pointed to the presence 
	of dark matter in galaxies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me mention some more women that 
	come to mind in professions that are not so exclusively male anymore but 
	still are not too women friendly either. For one thing, this list proves 
	that despite the proverbial glass ceiling that women face, the fact remains 
	that women have succeeded in climbing up the corporate ladder by sheer dint 
	of their competence. The glass ceiling is not unbreakable. The list below is 
	by no means exhaustive, and the positions mentioned below are either current 
	or were held at one time, either way it suffices to make the point. </font>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I urge members from Bangladesh, 
	India and other countries to mention more examples if they are aware of. I 
	look forward to the day when we will have women bosses in the work place, 
	besides men, who will be seen as a boss just like their male counterparts, 
	commanding respect and fear, and not as women, just like the male bosses are 
	seen as bosses, not as men. I also look forward to the day when women in 
	Bangladesh can drive buses and autorickshaws, if they choose to, without 
	having to fear facing ridicule or harassment. Most of all I look forward to 
	that day when IWD will lose its relevance and will only have a historical 
	value, to reflect on the past and celebrate the victory. </font></p>
