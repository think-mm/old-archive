  <p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>A SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF LIFE, DEATH,
  IMMORTALITY</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>By Aparthib</b></font></p>
  <p>It is appropriate to look at the issues on Life, death, Life after death
  (Immortality) from an alternate angle, that is not based on faith (Like the
  existence of Life after death, day of judgment etc), or obvious observations
  not requiring any thought (Like we will all die, we are mortal etc), or
  armchair philosophizing, but based on the hard earned objective insights
  gained through painstaking scientific observations and scientific thinking
  that has and continues to revolutionize our thoughts and paradigms. It must be
  understood in clear terms that scientific insights are consensus based as they
  are rooted in objective evidence and rational thinking and hence crosses
  cultural, religious and racial boundaries. Most of our contemporary
  understanding of Life and the universe are based on these universal natural
  principles and hence not the product of any specific culture or bias. Let me
  now proceed with these profound questions, What is Life? What is the purpose
  of life? Is there life after death? Why do we die? These are old questions
  although the meaning of the questions (and of course the answers) have changed
  over the years in view of a wealth of insights gained thanks to the
  revolutionary way scientific thinking has changed human perceptions and
  knowledge and the remarkable discoveries and insights that it has led to and
  is still leading to. To briefly phrase the best known scientific answer today
  in scientific jargon : &quot;Life is a dissipative structure that has achieved
  the threshold of complexity to become an autopoietic system.&quot; The purpose
  of life is to faithfully obey the Second Law of Thermodynamics by increasing
  entropy (Even eating and sex are dictated by this requirement, although our
  brain translates it into a sense of desire and pleasure for us, hiding the
  real underlying purpose from our conscious mind). Why do we die? In short
  because we (i.e most plants and animals) have inherited through evolution
  death genes from our protist (single celled organisms with nucleus) ancestors
  that took to reproduction through sex purely due to a better evolutionary
  survival strategy in tough primitive environments. Death is brought about in a
  programmed way by certain genes (death genes). Those few life forms (bacteria)
  that did not and still do not reproduce sexually are immortal, barring
  accidental deaths. Is there life after death? How can one define life AFTER
  death to begin with? If that new Life after death must require the same
  material body then what age should that body be? What if someone dies at age
  6. Will he/she be resurrected at 6? What if someone dies at 90? Will he/she be
  resurrected at 90? Will the resurrected body age again? If not then what is
  the meaning to be alive at 90 forever or at 6? Unless one can answer these
  questions, the vague concept of Life after death will be a product of refusal
  to accept death as a permanent destruction of one's self. All scientific and
  logical reasoning points to an absurdity of resurrection in the way humans
  wish to look at it. Some form of simulation of one's life (Virtual reality) is
  however, possible to envisage within scientific framework, but that would be
  pure science without any theosophical basis. This has been speculated by
  Physicist Frank Tipler in his book &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;,
  although latest observations point to an unlikely prospect for its coming true
  (scientifically). (See reference 13 at the end for links to this book). As
  mentioned before, the question of Life after death is rooted in the human
  refusal to accept death as the ultimate termination of their identity. This
  fear of death and urge for immortality results from Self-Awareness, a
  necessary attribute of human consciousness which makes us distinct from other
  species, whose primary instincts are propagation, and avoiding dangers so as
  to successfully pass their genes to net generation. A conscious anxiety due to
  awareness of death is not present in other animals. Now If life is defined as
  the genetic code (Which after all directs growth of our body and brain), the
  program of our living body then yes there is life after death, just as a
  software program exists independent of the physical computer and after the
  program has stopped running. Our bodies die, but our genes (and thus genetic
  code) live on through propagation. And if one does not leave any offspring,
  one can preserve his/her life by doing a complete genome sequence and saving
  it for eternity as an information in a database. Someday if biotechnology is
  sufficiently advanced, a resurrection may not be that far fetched an idea.
  Although the resurrected human will not be an exact replica of the original,
  since the brain wiring is shaped principally by environmental stimulus, which
  can never be the same in every rerun of the program of life. That's why we say
  that human nature is part(mostly) genetic, part environmental. A similar
  analogy of software running on a hardware is a nuclear bomb. The spectacular
  mushroom cloud, the blast, the destruction is just nothing but a
  materialization of an information or code (The laws of nuclear physics and
  relativity) with some hardware ingredients (uranium etc). Behind any natural
  or artificial wonders are nothing but some code (ultimately reducible to the
  laws of Physics) at work. Some programs need human intervention to run (Like
  nuclear bomb), others (like life, snowflakes, stars etc) are initiated by
  nature itself through chaotic effects. But it is only a matter of perspective.
  If we take the big picture of humans as being part of nature obeying laws of
  physics then every materialization of code in nature is spontaneous, and human
  intervention is also a result of natural laws at work. The ultimate example of
  materialization of physical laws is the Big Bang which created the entire
  universe together with all its life forms and other structures. The Big Bang
  was the materialization of the Physical laws (Software) using the hardware of
  tiny quantum bubble created through fluctuations of quantum vacuum. Thus a
  tiny Quantum Bubble ended up as the observable universe we wonder at today,
  thanks to the laws of Physics. Big Bang is certainly a speculation, albeit a
  scientific one. It is predicted by the same principles of Physics that
  predicted nuclear bomb which was also successfully tested(Any doubter?). Do we
  dare question the reality of nuclear bomb? We cannot question the validity of
  the laws of Physics while placing complete unquestioning confidence in the
  reality of a nuclear bomb whenever one is built, since the latter is nothing
  but a materialization of the former. So Big Bang, or some possible variation
  thereof in future (As dictated by Physics), which is predicted by the same
  laws of Physics that gave rise to nuclear bomb cannot be dismissed using
  non-scientific reasoning. Back to the main theme. The questions of life, death
  and immortality have intrigued humanity since the dawn of civilization when
  consciousness evolved to a mature state in the human brain from the more
  primitive reptilian brain. This is a question whose complete answer has not
  and will not be answered in one sweeping breakthrough or by one human in a
  finite time. Neither should this profound question of humanity be curtly
  dismissed with &quot;It is God's miracle, its beyond human comprehension&quot;
  type of answers. The fundamental fact is that the answer lies in an
  incremental approach to THE truth rather than a complete grasp of it. Like the
  geometric idea of an asymptote, to which a curve gets closer and closer to but
  never quite reaches it, truth about the nature of life and death is a slowly
  unravelling secret/insight. One can get closer and closer to the truth. A lot
  has been learned already. Very few of us laymen actually are aware of the
  rapid increase in understanding that has been going on. We only get a jolt
  when a flash of news are thrown at us, for example, cloning of the sheep
  Dolly, the completion of the human genome project, continued development of
  gene therapy etc. First of all it must be understood that saying that Life is
  the miraculous work of a Divine creator does not &quot;explain&quot; life, it
  only puts a closure to the quest for the answer and allows human to go about
  mundane pursuits so as not to be distressed by the failure to understand it.
  It is a common human instinct to put a closure to any unresolved questions.
  one feels uneasy living with mysteries and unanswered questions. A scientific
  inquiry must go against this instinct and strive for further insights,
  incremental advance being the goal, not a closure necessarily. That was then,
  millennia ago when our intellects were primitive that such simplistic answers
  were put forth. But humanity have come a long way since then. Engaging in
  vague metaphysics does not get us much further in the quest for truth. Now a
  genuine understanding should involve a scientific study spanning across a host
  of disciplines. Although we don't know the full answer to these questions we
  do know that a lot of insight into life has been gained and also know where to
  look for them. And it is in the sciences. As I said before, the complete
  answer will never be known but we can certainly get the best answer available
  at the current time. And science provides that. One has to look into the
  sciences with all its modern insights. Every day a new insight is being added
  to the knowledge base and getting us incrementally closer to the final
  understanding. Quantum jumps of insight do occur in history. For example
  Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Mendel's theory of heredity and most importantly
  the almost legendary discovery of DNA and deciphering of the genetic code in
  1953. The experiments of Urey and Miller showed how chemical and physical
  process can create the ingredients of life if not life itself(as yet). These
  are facts of life that are universal and crosses all religious boundaries,
  unlike religious &quot;explanations&quot; of life. Although Darwin explained
  beautifully how life evolved from simple to the complex but only vaguely
  mentioned about a possible mechanism of the origin of life itself (The
  primitive pond). The first scientific attempt to understand the origin of Life
  was by the Russian scientist Oparin in his 1929 classic &quot;The Origin of
  Life&quot;. He extended the Darwinian theory of evolution backward in time to
  explain how simple organic and inorganic materials might have combined into
  complex organic compounds and how the latter might have formed the primordial
  organism. The first attempt to understand life in a more fundamental way was
  by the nobel laureate physicist none other than the founder of quantum physics
  Erwin Schroedinger in his epoch making book &quot;What is Life? The Physical
  Aspect of the Living Cell With Mind and Matter&quot; written more than fifty
  years ago. He anticipated DNA in that book even before its discovery (He
  called it some kind of aperiodic crystal). Although now dated, it is a mark of
  amazing insight for its time. This book was the inspiration for all later
  generation biologists and physicists interested in life's mystery like Watson
  and Crick who materialized their inspiration into discovering the
  &quot;DNA&quot;, Schrodinger's aperiodic crystal. About fifty years later
  another physicist from Princeton, Freeman Dyson improved upon Schrodinger's
  idea and wrote the book &quot;Origins of Life&quot;. His ideas have been based
  on much more insights gained in Biology and Physics since Schrodinger and
  others. There has been a continued increase in our understanding of life and
  its origins by scientists all around the world. One of the most creative of
  them all was the Sri Lankan born American chemist/biologist Ponnamperuma, who
  was the director of the laboratory of the chemical evolution of life at the
  University of Maryland until his premature death in 1995. He along with Carl
  Sagan and Ruth Martiner was able to produce ATP, one of the fundamental
  building block of DNA, and thus life. His insights into the chemical nature of
  life's evolution signifies a quantum jump from the days of Schroedinger and
  Oparin. Incidentally, Ponnaperuma was also the founder of the Third World
  Foundation, an organization dedicated to the promotion of scientific minds of
  the third world countries. Ponnamperuma said if God exists then he must be a
  organic chemist. He called HCN molecule &quot;GOD molecule&quot; because the
  intriguing way this molecule gives rise to more complex molecules of life. A
  nice article on the origin of life with some description of Ponnamperuma's
  work can be found at the site: http://www.rit.edu/~flwstv/biology.html.
  Another pioneer in life research is Nobel Laureate Eigen. He was able to
  induce (chemically) RNA molecules to replicate in the lab. This is very close
  to producing a virus. Viruses are in between living and non-living. Two more
  pioneers that should be mentioned are Stuart Kauffman (A Biochemist) and Nobel
  Laureate Ilya Prigogine (A physical chemist) both of whom have shown how order
  can spring out of chaos. At the base of it all is the most profound aspect of
  life which is the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the law of increase of
  entropy. In fact the purpose of life if one has to find one is to satisfy the
  second law and to maximize entropy production as I said before. The main
  attribute of life is autopoiesis, a tendency of aggregate molecules of matter
  to maintain its identity through metabolism and replication/reproduction. And
  autopoiesis is the inevitable result of a dissipative system trying to
  maintain its far from equilibrium (thermodynamic) state to maximize entropy
  generation. A dissipative system is one that requires continuous input of
  energy to maintain itself. The more advanced life becomes the more it will
  have to generate entropy (through waste products). This is the mystery of
  life. Our desire to live, lust, hunger is nothing but a very advanced
  manifestation of the laws of physics at work at the cell level. About death,
  biologists have found that death is the result of sex. As Richard Dawkins,
  author of the legendary &quot;The selfish Gene&quot; says, death is the first
  sexually transmitted disease. Bacteria are not sexual. They reproduce
  asexually. They never die. They are truly immortal. When the primitive
  unicellular bacterial ancestor of all animals (protists) first switched to
  sexual mode of reproduction death was an inevitable consequence. We have
  traded immortality for sexual pleasure. While current insight from molecular
  bilogy do suggest that longevity may be controlled by the telomerese in
  chromosomes, but deat cannot be completely prevented. Life is not simply an
  entity created from scratch from conception to birth. Life is an evolving
  process that has been going on over billions of years in an incremental way.
  Our body may have been formed in matter of years after conception, but the
  program (our genome sequence) that builds us (our body+mind) has taken
  billions of years to perfect. The most insightful discovery by Darwin was that
  natural selection and mutation can give rise to a complex life form as human
  through a prolonged and cumulative action of those laws. The complicated body
  and brain of ours are not just a creation from our birth to date. We have
  inherited the blueprint of life (the genetic code) that has evolved and
  perfected through billions of years of evolution. That's why life is so
  precious. It contains huge information collected over an incredibly long span
  of time. Our genome sequence will take thousands of pages to write down in
  paper. Like a complex software that starts with few simple lines but
  eventually is perfected into a sophisticated program of millions of lines with
  contributions from many people over a long time, the genetic code of life took
  billions of years to be developed and is still evolving. Life will look
  different and more advanced in another million years. We can never understand
  life without understanding the history of how life has evolved from the
  primordial earth with single cells becoming more and more complex by
  incremental steps. But the process of this evolution of life from simple to
  complex is purely natural. Down at the bottom it is nothing but physics.
  Natural selection and mutation is nothing more than a manifestation of the
  laws of Physics at work on cell/gene level. As Nobel Laureate Watson of DNA
  fame said &quot;In the last analysis, there are only atoms. There's just one
  science, Physics; everything else is social work&quot; in his lecture at the
  London Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1985. This view is also echoed by
  Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg. Hawking nicely summarizes this view as:
  Biology-&gt;Chemistry-&gt; Physics. Steven Weinberg says in his book
  &quot;Facing Up&quot;, p-22-3: &quot;No biologist today will be content with
  an axiom about biological behaviours that could not be imagined to have a more
  fundamental level. That more fundamental level would have to be the level of
  Physics and chemistry, and the contigency that the earth is billions of years
  old&quot; Biologist Richard Dawkins (in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;)
  states that Physicists have to come into the scene at the end of the long
  chain of reasoning to explain evolution of life to complete the last but not
  the least significant step. (In this context also refer to reference 7 at the
  end ). Renowned biologist Earnst Mayr wrote in his book &quot;The growth of
  Biological Thoughts ('82)&quot;: &quot;Every biologist is fully aware of the
  fact that moleculr biology has demonstrated decisively that all processes in
  living organisms can be explained in terms of Physics and chemistry&quot; (As
  cited in Weinberg,&quot;Facing Up&quot;, p-19) Physicist Heinz Pagels wrote in
  his book &quot;The Dreams of Reason&quot;,p-49: &quot;Biological systems are
  extremely complex Qunatum mechanical entities functioning according to
  well-defined rules.&quot;</p>
  <p>A caveat must be issued that it is never implied that Physics is complete
  and all that can be known is known already. There will certainly be insights
  gained in Physics in future and current concepts and laws may be revised or
  subsumed under a more comprehensive scheme of laws (Theory of Everything). But
  it will not at least invalidate what is certainly known and tested today, like
  nuclear Physics and relativity since nuclear bomb is the litmus test of its
  validity, among many others. We are misled by apparent beauty and complexity
  of a product to immediately conceive of a designer with a human attribute. But
  it is nature which is the designer. Sure, humans as yet cannot create life,
  but that does not automatically imply life must be a direct product of a
  divine act. Humans cannot make a naturally beautiful snowflake or a natural
  gemstone with beautiful patterns either. But we know these are all results of
  the Laws of Physics. Similarly, life, in all its complexity, impossible for
  humans to create, is nothing but the result of the laws of Physics, although
  acting over a long (billions of years) period of time, unlike snowflakes where
  it acts over a much shorter time span. If there has to be a divine designer
  for life then it is the Laws of Physics. A beautiful snowflake with its
  artistic and symmetric pattern is just a result of the laws of thermodynamics
  and Quantum mechanics. So is life. Life is an EMERGENT behaviour of matter.
  Life is a result of self organization of matter driven by the requirements to
  maximize entropy and reduce the gradient of temperature difference between sun
  and earth. What is the origin of the laws of physics? Here we reach the wall.
  Nobody knows. If one really has to contemplate a designer, then its the law of
  Physics that one has to wonder who is the designer of. But at this primal
  level it hardly matters whether one postulates a grand designer that exists
  necessarily without itself(himself?) requiring a creator, or postulates that
  the the Law of Physics exists necessarily without a creator. The former just
  provides a consolation to mortals in the form of a promise of a personal God
  looking after each human who will resurrect him someday and bestow eternal
  life along with the fulfillment of all desires unfulfilled in this life. So
  this question of the designer of the Laws of Physics has no answer, or better
  yet, it is not a meaningful question even. Just saying &quot;God&quot; made
  these laws is another way of saying we don't know. It sounds better than
  admitting ignorance. But it does not increase our insight by phrasing it that
  way. Its a pretentious cop out. We can &quot;label&quot; the unknown as
  &quot;GOD&quot;, but that's an affirmation of our ignorance, not a deep
  realization. But we as human can still spend our lifetime learning and
  discovering just the natural laws that exist and understand how it (Natural
  Laws) works and give rise to the marvelous phenomena of evolution, formation
  of stars, galaxies, snowflakes etc and try to understand life in an
  incremental way. There is no reason (other than faith, which does not require
  reason) to assume that the phenomenon of life cannot be ever understood in
  terms of natural laws. The fact that we do not completely understand it now
  does not imply that it is not understandable in physical terms. We don't
  understand weather too, in spite of all the technical advances. This lack of
  understanding is rooted in the complexity of weather and life. The chain of
  reasoning based on laws of physics that links a simple molecule to a living
  organism is broken in the middle due to the enormous complexity of cumulative
  effects of over billions of years of evolution. In weather, it is the enormous
  number of air molecules that is at the root of complexity preventing an exact
  understanding. Trying to understand life however in itself is no trivial a
  task. After all, its the journey, not the destination that is fulfilling. If
  there at all one has to find any meaning of this finite life then the best
  candidate for meaning is the search to find the answers to how life has
  evolved and will evolve. This is the best use humans can make of their
  &quot;gift&quot; of consciousness, a gift since it was after all not required
  by evolution for survival, but came as a by product. If one has to speak of
  teleology then I think it is best to say we have acquired consciousness so
  that we can ask how we came about and answer it by understanding the very laws
  of nature that are at work behind all this marvelous creations (including
  ourselves) and evolution. Even if one insists on believing in a personal God,
  what could be a better pursuit than to try to understand and discover the
  wonderful Laws of nature, reading the mind of God in the words of Stephen
  Hawking? Surely its a more appropriate tribute to &quot;God&quot; than
  worshipping. The most intriguing thing about consciousness is that it
  satisfies a consistency loop (Here &quot;-&gt;&quot; means gives rise to or
  explains):</p>
  <p>Physical laws -&gt; matter -&gt; Life -&gt;Consciousness -&gt; Physical
  Laws.</p>
  <p>In other words our minds and consciousness have discovered (through
  scientific search) the very same physical laws that created it(consciousness)
  in the first place through creation of matter, life and evolution! Many top
  physicists, biologists, chemists (some Nobel laureates) are in the forefront
  of the research into the origin and evolution of life. Now they are being
  joined in this search by computer scientists (specially artificial
  life/intelligence people who view life as a software running on the hardware
  of human body. Some even believe that one day a fully conscious machine can be
  built!). We are witnessing an amazing synthesis of human knowledge and
  insights in the dawn of 21st century. Gone are the days when arm chair
  philosophers were idly talking about their pet theories of life, consciousness
  etc. Without the new language of genes, DNAs, entropy, Second Law,
  autocatalysis, autopoiesis any talk of life would now sound like childish
  babble, trapped in words going in circles, getting one nowhere. It would
  require a super philosopher today (There are a handful, Paul Davies, Daniel
  Dennett to name a couple) well versed in all these disciplines to pool
  together all these separate insights into a coherent story of life. Thousands
  of pages of results of scientific research into consciousness, mind, life are
  being published monthly in journals of evolutionary biology, evolutionary
  psychology, biomathematics, biophysics, molecular genetics, artificial
  intelligence, quantum consciousness etc. The best approximations to date of
  the truth of life are distributed among these separate database of knowledge
  that is rapidly expanding. Some of the key words vital to the understanding of
  life are: COMPLEXITY, EMERGENT PHENOMENA, CHAOS, SELF ORGANIZATION,
  DISSIPATIVE SYSTEMS, AUTOPOIETIC SYSTEMS, AUTOCATALYTIC PROCESS. etc. For us,
  not actively engaged in this quest, the only way to learn about the insights
  that have been achieved in the search for the answer to the question of life
  is through reading. Its frustrating to realize that despite reading enough in
  one's life time one will only get to know only a fraction. But again, learning
  the truth is a journey, and its the journey, not the destination that should
  give meaning to our finite life. I will suggest the following books as a start
  in addition to the the two books above by Schrodinger and Dyson. All these
  books are written by top scientists (Some Nobel laureates)in the forefront of
  research. Even reading all these books will only provide the tip of the
  iceberg (sigh).</p>
  <p>1. What is Life? - Lyn Margulis and Dorion Sagan [A book of incredible<br>
  insight in to life. A very appropriate title]</p>
  <p>2. What is Sex? - Lyn Margulis and Dorion Sagan [This is not a book<br>
  on ordinary sex as most understand it. But an evolutionary explanation<br>
  of how sexual reproduction evolved from bacteria to higher organisms over<br>
  billions of years and how genders became separated over time. Lyn Margulis<br>
  is a distinguished scientist with hundreds of publication and is affiliated<br>
  with many Nasa projects in exobiology. She has original ideas in biology<br>
  and is also in touch with Dyson and other physicists about the latest research<br>
  in life and evolution. By the way she was married to Late Carl Sagan. Dorion<br>
  Sagan is her son]</p>
  <p>3. The Selfish gene - Dawkins. (An eye opener, take a gene's eye view<br>
  of life)</p>
  <p>4. The Blind Watchmaker - Dawkins (Clearly shows how complex life can<br>
  evolve from simple through small natural steps)</p>
  <p>5. Climbing Mount Improbable - Dawkins (up todate and more convincing<br>
  than above)</p>
  <p>6. Vital Dust: Life as a Cosmic Imperative - Christian De Duve(Nobe<br>
  laureate) . Written both in a scientific and philosophical way</p>
  <p>7. Life's Other Secret: The New Mathematics of the Living World - Ian<br>
  Stewart Below is a summary of a talk by Ian Stewart with the same title<br>
  as the book above ( Given on 4/23/98 at the Univ. of Minnesota):</p>
  <p>What is life? Why is the world of living creatures so different from<br>
  the inorganic world? The discovery of the first secret of life, the molecular<br>
  structure of DNA, in the middle of this century, showed that Life is a<br>
  form of chemistry - but chemistry unlike any that ever graced a test tube.<br>
  Some secrets, however, lie deeper that the genetic code. It is the
  mathematical<br>
  law of physics and chemistry that control the growing organism's response<br>
  to its genetic instructions. That is Life's OTHER Secret. Its full
  understanding<br>
  will come only when we combine the mathematical and physical sciences with<br>
  biochemistry, genetics, and developmental biology. One of the most exciting<br>
  growth areas of twenty-first century science will be biomathematics. The<br>
  next century will witness an explosion of new mathematical concepts, of<br>
  new kinds of mathematics, brought into being by the need to understand<br>
  the patterns of the living world.</p>
