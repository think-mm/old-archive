  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is a response to the article &quot;<a href="http://www.bangladesh-web.com/news/jul/23/gv4n635.htm#A1">Islam
    Bashing – favorite pastime for some</a>&quot; written by Mr. K. Rahman
    which published in NFB on July 23, 2001. In his article,&nbsp; he made some
    brutal comment against the atheists in general,&nbsp; which led me to
    response accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">What is morality? Morality refers to the
    human propensity to judge certain forms of behavior as good and deserving of
    admiration, encouragement, and reward, and to judge other forms of behavior
    as bad, not to be imitated, and worthy of punishment. Morality also includes
    the systems of rules which particular societies develop to codify these
    judgments. These systems of rules are developed gradually over many
    generations and represent the judgment of many individuals about exactly
    what sorts of behaviors are right, what sorts are wrong, and what rewards
    and punishments should accompany each form of behavior. Humans have not only
    a propensity to judge various forms of behavior as morally right or wrong,
    but also a propensity to be sensitive to the judgments of their community
    and to be strongly influenced by the particular rules of their own
    communities. This propensity to conformity is also a part of morality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;Now, Saying that without God, not
    everything is permitted, is not the same as saying that our complex ethical
    systems are possible without God. Such systems exist. Are they evidence of
    God? Or did they come about in some other way?</font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800080">Mr. K Rahman </font><font face="Arial" color="#800080" size="3">traditionally
    wrote in his article - &quot;Godless person can do anything without fear of
    consequences.&quot; and eventually Mr. Rahman&nbsp; concluded by saying -
    &quot;The apparent innocence of the atheists is hypocrisy and once they get
    to the point of authority, they will be the worst murdered and ferocious
    creature I can think of!&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If we focus on historical evidences without
    being emotional we would have perceived that for a long time, devotion
    towards god has been the sanction for moral conduct. Our deshi culture
    promotes prayer, ritual customs, worship and devotion towards spirituality
    as an effective tool for constructing moral behavior. We have heard such
    statements from our parents, relatives, teachers for thousand times -&nbsp;&nbsp;
    “<font color="#0000FF"><b><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6413">Beshi
    korey Namaj porille Allah Sha’ab mapp kare divey</a></b></font>” (If you
    pray devoutly, Allah will forgive you for all sins). On the other hand, It's
    quite surprising to me how many people remarked, <font color="#0000FF"><b>&quot;Tumee
    Nastik ? Tobe to tumee ja khushi korte paaro - tomar choritro bole to kichu
    naai.&quot;</b></font> (You're an Atheist? You must have no conscience about
    committing crime then.) Despite the attempt of making our society peaceful
    through namaz, roza, haj, jakat, krishna-lila, the spread of war, hate,
    poverty and prejudice shows that the belief in god has not proved any
    effective sanction. The reason is very clear. Faith in god has been the
    indirect method to ensure moral conduct. For religious belief tells that god
    blesses those that are moral and punishes the immoral. <font color="#ff0000"><b>&quot;If
    a believer could obtain god's blessings by means other than morality, he
    could afford to ignore morality with impunity. Prayer, worship, ritual and
    sale of Indulgence are methods to gain god's favor without caring to be
    moral. They pray loud who fleece fellow-men.&quot; [ -Gora]</b></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Further, the growth of rationality and
    advancement of science reveals beyond doubt that god is an illusion.
    Therefore, by and large, faith in god is neither useful nor possible to keep
    man moral.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Atheism, in my opinion,&nbsp; takes a
    realistic appraisal of morality. Moral values, like truthfulness and
    compassion, are social imperatives. One should do what he says and say what
    he does in social relations. Otherwise common understanding is not possible.
    <b><i>Hence morality is a social necessity and not a passport to heaven.</i></b>
    As believers of god do not understand the social significance of morality,
    war and inequality have prevailed in theistic civilization, despite ages of
    belief in god. Look at the examples of the activities of our famous
    Razakar-bahini in 1971. They killed thousands of innocent Bangalee people,
    raped, murdered, destroyed, liquidated, slaughtered --everything they did by
    the name of Islam. Take the example of the activities of stubborn
    fundamentalist &quot;Shiva Shenas&quot; during the period when they
    destroyed Babri mosque. But atheism encourages the people to insist on
    truthfulness, because the untruthfulness of any disturbs the happiness of
    others in a social milieu. Thus social checks and counter-checks are real
    and affective to keep up morality. Atheism never produce vindictive Shiva
    Shena or Razakar Bahini. Atheism encourages to be a real man free from
    dogmatism and fundamentalism. <b>As long as a belief in god lingers in the
    society, man's mind is divided between obedience to god and obligations to
    fellow men. When faith in god is wholly dismissed, social checks grow strong
    and the level of morality rises.</b></font></p>
    <p><b><i><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="3">Not belief in god, but
    the disbelief makes man moral.</font></i></b></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial" color="#800080" size="3">Mr. Rahman also mentioned
    in his article, &quot;You bet a Muslim (who practices faith)&nbsp; will not
    be a thief or liar. The same cannot be said for a devout atheist who will
    work only for his material interest.&quot;</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">His intention is very clear - &quot;Atheist
    people are immoral&quot; and &quot;Believers are obviously moral&quot;.&nbsp;
    Well, to evaluate whether spirituality and other religious values (I am not
    taking any specific religion in this case)&nbsp; is necessary for moral
    conduct, we should devise a test for morality. Non-killing is moral for a
    civilian but killing the enemy is the ethics of a soldier. Monogamy is a
    moral principle enjoyed by Christians, but Muslims resent interference with
    their right to be polygamous. Truthfulness is a commonly accepted axiom of
    morality, but governments administer the oath of secrecy on their officers.
    While moral values thus differ with custom and expediency, there should
    still be a standard for all humans. And that is the recognition of equality
    of all humans. Therefore, ethics of all religions and constitutions of
    governments proclaim equality as their pious objective.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Judged by the test of equality, the workings
    of religious belief through long ages of past history and the professions of
    spirituality have but failed to achieve equality.<b> On the contrary,
    religious belief has justified existence of inequality on the plea of divine
    pleasure.</b> Hindu faith attributes inequalities to the deeds of past
    birth. Islam also did the same. We get those X-rated version of heavenly
    bliss (eternal huri, wine, sex ..) described in all religious scriptures in
    afterlife. Those stories which are full of carnal gratification, sensual
    pleasures are reserved for man only should be the key for my present-life
    honesty?&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000" size="3">&quot; for them is reserved a
    definite<br>
    provision, fruit and a great honour in the Gardens of<br>
    Bliss reclining upon couches arranged face to face,<br>
    a cup from a fountain being passed round<br>
    to them, white, a pleasure to the drinkers .....<br>
    and with them wide-eyed maidens flexing<br>
    their glances as if they were slightly<br>
    concealed pearls.&quot; ( The Rangers 40: 45 )</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">How a rational person can make himself
    believe that&nbsp; he will remain honest to achieve those dishonest reward
    in afterlife ? All those &quot;haram&quot; things are cleverly, wickedly and
    dishonestly made &quot;halal&quot; in paradise, for which the believers are
    waiting so long!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While primitive people with simple thoughts
    lived equal, organized religious belief of 'civilized' life raised
    inequalities by suppressing free thought and free action and wickedly
    reconciled the faithful to their miserable lot by holding out the promise of
    heavenly bliss in after-life. <b>So it is wrong to suppose that spirituality
    and belief in god would promote morality.</b> Besides, attempts at raising
    moral standards were deemed irreligious, blasphemous, heretical or even
    atheistic by their contemporaries. Persecutions of prophets and their
    followers in every age are illustrations of the conservatism of religious
    belief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The reason for the failure of religious
    belief to sustain morality is obvious. Of course, the honest objective of
    religious faith is to make man moral through hope of heaven and fear of
    hell. And many people are restricting&nbsp; themselves to do crime because
    of &quot;Guna&quot;, I admit. But it is also true that god, heaven, hell and
    rebirth, being falsehoods, could be easily exploited by the clever people
    while the meek laity lay downtrodden. The same is the defect of all
    spiritual values. <b>Their intangibility is their weakness. They hold out
    big promise -- but prove false in fulfillment. </b>How long can people live
    in the hope of heaven after life, while the present is miserable especially
    in comparison with pomp and comfort of dishonest fellows? The present is
    real. So honest believers also are tempted to go dishonest and to reap
    immediate gains. Thus, instead of promoting morality, religious faith
    encouraged dishonesty and inequality. If only fear of &quot;Guna&quot; be
    enough to make mankind moral, then there would be no need for democratic
    rules, regulations, police forces, laws and&nbsp; courts in present life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><font color="#ff0000">Real morality is
    possible when the sanctions for morality are also tangible and real.
    Therefore, atheism shifts the basis of morality from faith in god to
    obligations of social living. Moral conduct is not a passport to heaven; it
    is social necessity. </font></b>As we are all humans, belonging to the same
    species, we should live equal. Any attempt to transgress the obligation
    should be checked and punished here and now by fellow-humans. The immorality
    of one injures the happiness of others involved in a social association.
    Therefore the checks on immorality are also social needs. There is no
    postponement of the punishment to the imaginary fires of hell or to fanciful
    faith in divine retribution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Whether people can be so conscious of social
    obligations as to check immorality here and now, is a doubt that rises in
    the minds of people who are accustomed to religious faith. Because morality
    is a social necessity, the moment faith in god is banished, man's gaze turns
    from god to man and he becomes socially conscious. <b>Religious belief
    prevented the growth of a sense of realism. But atheism at once makes man
    realistic and alive the needs of morality.</b> Atheism alone is the surest
    way to morality. Those who oppose atheism in any form betray their vested
    interests in inequality of some kind of other (from Gora).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">So, It is completely wrong for Mr. Rahman to
    judge and conclude&nbsp; that all Atheists are immoral. Yes, If you define
    morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they
    don't obey any God. But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of
    what is acceptable (&quot;right&quot;) and unacceptable (&quot;wrong&quot;)
    behavior within society. If Mr. Rahman would&nbsp; remain his eyes open he
    would have seen that many atheists behave in a &quot;moral&quot; or
    &quot;compassionate&quot; way simply because they feel a natural tendency to
    empathize with other humans.&nbsp; Many atheists are respected father or
    loving mother, sister, daughter or son in their personal life and
    contributing a lot in their professional, social and cultural life like
    others. <b>So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on
    moral behavior.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, Naturally, there are some people who
    behave &quot;immorally&quot; and try to use atheism to justify their
    actions. Polpot, Stalin may be some of the examples. Yes, Polpot may be an
    atheist and may be he is also a monster. But I am also an atheist, and I am
    NOT a monster.&nbsp; So what is the conclusion ?&nbsp; If you mean
    &quot;Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?&quot;, then the answer
    is obviously no. Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a
    person will behave. Most atheists follow many of the same &quot;moral
    rules&quot; as defined by HUMANISTS. Their view morality as something
    created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to
    work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural
    being or dogmatically following so called &quot;holy&quot; books.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However what Mr. Rahman totally ignored that&nbsp;
    like Polpot/Stalin there are equally many (actually a lot more than atheists
    ) people who behave &quot;immorally&quot; and then try to use religious
    beliefs to justify their actions. For example,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>&quot;Here is a trustworthy saying that
    deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ came into the world to save
    sinners... But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me... <b>Jesus
    Christ might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who
    would believe in him and receive eternal life. </b>Now to the king eternal,
    immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and
    ever.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The above quote is from a statement made to
    the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal
    serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It seems that for every atheist
    mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer. But what of more trivial
    morality?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Look at the interesting comment of our famous
    Razakar Professor of Dhaka University (Abdul Jabbar) who prays to god five
    times a day made an&nbsp; in 1971----<i>“The Razakars who are committing
    rape on Hindu women…are doing entirely legal…because, Islam legalized to
    get wives of enemy for the soldiers during wartime by mutaa marriage”.</i>
    (source : Ekatturer Ghatok dalalera k kothay) How can a believer define
    those trivial remarks?&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A survey conducted on hundred Indian
    prisoners in 988 by the &quot;Bharatiya Biggan o Yuktibaadi Shamiti&quot;&nbsp;
    (leaded by <b><a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/prabir/">Prabir Ghosh</a></b>)
    and was found that 100 percent all the prisoners&nbsp; are the believers of
    god [ Ref. Olukik Noy Loukik - Part 3, page 39] . If they would make the
    similar survey in Bangladesh, I am sure…they would get the same result.
    Again, According to the DOJ Bureau of Justice Statistics (National Census of
    the Jail Population 12/31/95), while 72% affirmed affiliation with religious
    institutions (determined through answers to the question on &quot;Religious
    Background&quot; on the Penal entrance form) only 54% of Federal and State
    Prisoners actually consider themselves religious, and 33% can be confirmed
    to be practicing their religion. In &quot;The New Criminology,&quot; Max D.
    Schlapp and Edward E. Smith say that two generations of statisticians found
    that the ratio of convicts without religious training is about 1/10th of 1%.
    W.T. Root, Professor of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, examined
    1,916 prisoners and said, &quot;<font color="#FF0000"><i>Indifference to
    religion, due to thought, strengthens character</i></font>,&quot; adding
    that Unitarians, Agnostics, Atheists and Free-Thinkers were absent from
    penitentiaries, or nearly so. During 10 years in Sing-Sing, of <font color="#FF0000"><b>those
    executed for murder</b></font> 65% were Catholics, 26% Protestants, 6%
    Hebrew, 2% Pagan, <font color="#FF0000"><b>and less than 1/3 of 1%
    non-religious</b></font>. Where does the religious morality stand then? It
    could be that the above statistics merely indicate that religion has no
    effect on moral behavior, or insufficient effect to result in an overall
    fall in immoral behavior. The same study also demonstrated that the
    believers are generally, less educated than the atheists. Therefore the same
    researchers believe that the reason the atheists are less likely to commit
    crime is because they are more enlightened&nbsp; than those who believe in a
    god.</font></p>

    <p>It is the common claim of religious believers that sense of right and
    wrong can only come from religion/God/spirituality and that anyone secular
    is devoid of any moral virtue. So by their criterion it follows that
    scientists/philosophers who hold secular beliefs or are atheists have no
    virtue at all and&nbsp; virtues are monopoly of religious believers only. It
    must be emphasized that Theists declare it as a rule that &quot;Morality
    cannot be enforced/defined without religion&quot; whereas Humanists/
    rationalists never declare it as rule that &quot;morality can ONLY be&nbsp;
    defined/enforced WITHOUT religion. They only affirm that morality is
    POSSIBLE&nbsp; independent of religion, and that immorality is also possible
    WITH religion. So even&nbsp; if there exists immorality among some atheists
    or some secular society&nbsp; that does not change the fact that morality in
    some other non-religious&nbsp; society/individual&nbsp; can also and do
    exist, and similarly even if there exists morality in some religious
    society/ individual that does not change the fact that immorality in another
    religious individual/society can and do exist despite religion. Let me
    summarize my points as follows:</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp; One exception breaks a rule.<br>
    2.&nbsp; Theists declare it as a rule that &quot;Morality cannot be
    enforced/defined<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without God of the religion&quot;<br>
    3. There are moral&nbsp; societies (e.g societies based on Buddhism) and<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals&nbsp; not based on God of the religion.
    Thus&nbsp; rule 2 is broken.</p>
    <p><b>First let me state an incontrovertible fact - that there are theists
    who commit immoral acts and there are conscientious non theists who behave
    morally</b>.<font color="#ff0000"> This fact already shows a basic weakness
    of the view that religion has monopoly on morality. </font>Theists might say
    that &quot;if a person was a TRUE follower of religious belief, then he/ she
    would not have committed any immoral act and the fact that a
    &quot;theist&quot; committed an immoral act only proves that his/her
    conviction in religion is not strong or sincere.&quot; Whether or not they
    were true believers in religion the fact still remains that they were not
    &quot;non-theists&quot;. And since there are &quot;non-theists&quot; who
    also behave morally so the immediate conclusion is that religious belief is
    not a necessary prerequisite for being moral. There are those who say
    &quot;Only strict adherence to religious injunctions/scriptures can
    guarantee a peaceful society, free from crime, oppression, injustice etc.
    And any violent and extreme acts of radical followers of the religion is
    discounted by saying that they are not true followers of religion and true
    followers of religion would never have engaged in such acts. The flaw in
    these assertions is that<font color="#ff0000"> it can be simply argued that
    strict adherence to the law of the land is adequate to ensure peace. And if
    everyone followed the rule of law then that would suffice to make a society
    free from crime and injustice</font>. The fact that a strict theocratic
    state has less crime is not because people are so conscientious through deep
    belief in the true spirit of religion that they refrain from wrong doings
    but because severe punishments by the theocratic state machinery are
    enforced and serve as powerful deterrents. In other words it is not
    primarily a fear of God that<br>
    helps to prevent crime in a theocratic state, but a fear of human. Had there
    been any slack in the enforcement of law or if left to the people's
    religious conscience then those societies would be full of crimes and all
    sorts of immoral acts. The theocratic system of laws did not succeed in
    eliminating the evil instincts in the heart of the followers, only succeeded
    in putting a lid on it with the potential for that lid to rupture any time
    as is sometimes reported in those societies. On the other hand those secular
    non- theocratic states who have managed to enforce the civil laws
    effectively also are free from crimes, example is Singapore, communist China
    ( Before the openness). In fact it is ironically true that, autocracy in any
    form helps to enforce law in any society. Since theocracy is a form of
    autocracy it tends to give one an illusion that it is religion that is
    ensuring the peace in the society, where in fact it is the draconian<br>
    enforcement by humans of a (theocratic) authoritarian rule which which is
    responsible.</p>
    <p>If one thinks carefully It will be evident that religious injunctions
    actually REAFFIRM what humans already intuitively know to be wrong or right
    through the faculty of conscience. CONSCIENCE is as much a part of inherent
    human instinct like any other . Like all human instincts it is rooted in the
    evolutionary biology of human over millions of years. Natural selection
    (acting on the profound laws of Physics over a long span of time) gives rise
    to those human instincts that help in its survival and propagation as a
    species. In more modern biological language, conscience is the inhibiting
    effect of our cerebral cortex on the primitive impulses coming from our
    reptilian part of the brain ( limbic system). <b>It has been observed quite
    extensively by psychologists and neurologists that a serious damage to the
    cerebral cortex impairs the judgment faculty of humans and a conscientious
    person can become less conscientious while still functioning normally
    otherwise</b>. These primitive instincts are also biologically rooted and
    are traced to the biological imperatives of aggression, dominance, mating
    and propagation needed for evolutionary survival. For lower animals only
    these baser instincts are necessary for their survival and they didn't
    evolve conscience (no highly developed cerebral cortex). Only humans evolved
    this faculty as evolution &quot;chose&quot; (randomly of course) humans to
    the most evolved species. Human species has the highest Encephalization
    Quotient (E.Q = 7) which is a measure of how large the brain is compared to
    the size that is required for a basic survivial. Humans are not limited to
    the basic survivial impulses of lower animals, but have memory, experience
    and knowledge all aquired through the extra amount of brain (mostly cerebral
    cortex) that helps him to judge his surroundings and make informed
    decisions, sometimes in contradiction to the basic urges.</p>
    <p>So the assertion that morality is not rooted genetically is also not in
    accord with the contemporary view of biology. Our instinct of conscience
    developed long before the the relatively recent arrival (in evolutionary
    terms) of revealed religions, so stating that conscience (or sense of right
    and wrong) is a result of God's revelation is an anachronism. <b>The
    revealed religions of Islam and Christianity came long after the Greeks
    already were familiar with and discussing the concepts of morality</b>. All
    aspects of morality that religion preaches had been taught by Confucius,
    Buddha, and other ancient sages in different civilizations independent of
    divine<br>
    preaching of morality. Besides it contradicts simple common sense that if
    indeed God was the only source of morality then the complexity of human
    brain and its evolution and its well known role in judgment faculty would be
    totally redundant and unnecessary. After all God could just instill that
    faculty without this unnecessary structural complications in our brain which
    is known to affect our judgement faculty and hence sense of morality.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;We can see there is an inherent fallacy in basing right and wrong
    on a divine entity. For example the usual explanation of religion declaring
    some action &quot;X&quot; as wrong (X= rape/stealing/murder etc) is that
    God, as the source of all righteousness cannot allow such an evil act
    &quot;X&quot; to be committed. Why is &quot;X&quot; evil? Here a
    satisfactory answer is not possible. Any attempt to explain why
    &quot;X&quot; is evil will defeat the premise that an evil is what God
    decrees as evil. So according to the religious believers, ultimately an evil
    is what God &quot;decides&quot; to be evil (criterion for such decision is
    supposedly unknown to human). There is no human criterion that can explain
    why something is evil. In other words to be consistent they have to admit
    they cannot explain in human terms why rape/murder/theft etc are evil other
    than saying that it is only evil because it is declared so by God. By the
    same token if these acts were allowed and declared moral then to be
    consistent a blind follower of revelations could not have challenged that
    and accepted them blindly to be moral as declared by God, he/ she would not
    need any justification/explanation in human terms as to why these acts are
    allowed or declared moral. <b>But in reality if an apologist of religion is
    asked as to why these &quot;evils&quot; are not allowed, invariably the
    answer will be &quot;God can never allow such acts since they are
    evil&quot;. So unwittingly they engage in circular reasoning and betray
    their own instinctive human perception of right and wrong in defending why
    these acts are not allowed by God</b>. if things are neither right nor wrong
    independently of God's revelations, then God cannot choose one thing over
    another because it is right. An apologist might argue, for example, that God
    would never condone such killing, raping, stealing, and torturing, for God
    is all good. But if goodness is a defining attribute of God, then God cannot
    be used to define goodness, for, in that case, the definition<br>
    would be circular - the concept being defined would be doing the defining -
    and such a definition would be useless. Hence at the root of all these
    conceptual contradictions is the deeply rooted human instinctive notion of
    right and wrong (conscience) independent of God's revelation which a theist
    invariably appeals to when arguing about morality and its divineness as we
    saw above. <b>So this instinctive notion of morality must be more
    fundamental and precede any belief in revelations and thus debunks the claim
    of theists that concept of morality can only be rooted in religion</b>.</p>
    <p>Religion seems to provide a deterrent by the threat of punishment in hell
    and reward of heaven to naive minds. But the same can be and is achieved in
    any civilized society by the civil laws. The reason a person with no strong
    conscience does not commit a rape in public is NOT because it is forbidden
    in religion BUT because he will be arrested immediately and thrown to jail
    or sent to death row. In old days, in some societies, laws and penal codes
    were not established or effectively enforced and integrated as part of
    Government/State machinery as it is now. So in those societies religious
    injunctions were the only deterrent against such uninhibited acts of
    &quot;wrong&quot; . In societies where there were other human methods of
    checks and balances this concept of divine arbiter to settle morality was
    not relevant or necessary. For example a large population of the world are
    Buddhist society. Buddhism is based on Godless morality. Even before
    Buddhism the morality of ancient Chinese was based (and to a great extent is
    still based) on the teachings of Confucius which in turn is based on human
    values, not divine. Even the ancient Incas and Mayas had evolved a highly
    organized society without the help of a revealed religion. Good people do
    good because they want to do good - not because they will personally benefit
    from it or because someone has forced them to do it. People who do good
    solely for personal gain or to avoid personal harm are not the ideal good
    people. Someone who saves a drowning child, for example,<br>
    only because he was offered a reward or was physically threatened does not
    deserve much praise. Thus, if one's only reason for performing good actions
    is his/her desire to go to heaven or his/her fear of going to hell - if all
    his/her actions are motivated purely by self interest - then ideally it
    should not qualify him/her for heaven because he/she acted out of pure
    self-interest and hence not a good person worth the reward, since heaven is
    for truly good people, who would be selfless. Thus the the religious concept
    of heaven/hell and morality leads to a contradiction. Besides, the threat of
    divine punishment cannot impose a moral obligation, for might does not make
    right. Threats extort; they do not create a moral duty. Thus, if our only<br>
    reason for obeying God is the fear of punishment if we do not, then, from a
    moral point of view, God has no more claim to our allegiance than Hitler or
    Stalin. Morality then literally becomes an unquestioning compliance of
    divine commands.</p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier religious believers assert that a secular/Godless
    person has no sense of virtue or right or wrong. Hence according to their
    views, followers of philosophies (Buddhism, Confucius, Shamanism, Shintoism,
    Bahai etc, none of which believes in God or divinity of any kind) do not
    have or are capable of forming the judgment of right or wrong. <b>But in
    reality these people do indeed show sense of right and wrong. and are just
    as capable of private moral behavior as theists</b>. Thus belief in a
    certain God does not seem to be a prerequisite. It is true that some
    universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of
    society. But it is incorrect to assume that God/ religion is the ONLY or
    BEST possible source of such standards. Early and medieval Philosophers such
    as Plato, Kant, John Stuart Mill, George Edward Moore, and John Rawls did
    make convincing arguments that it is possible to have a universal morality
    without God and we see this is true in practice in any societies not based
    on revealed religions. Morality/virtue etc is an evolving personal and group
    code of conduct that seem to reflect the most efficient way of maintaining
    personal and group stability and peace in a community of people with clash
    of interests and values. It is a product of the natural selection, through
    trial and error. After all, human species itself is a product of evolution
    via natural selection, so morality also has to be part of that natural
    selection. It is part of simply being human, whether or not one believes in
    a higher personal God of the religion or spirituality.</p>
    <p>We should realize that the notion of right and wrong exist because humans
    are being with needs, and that human beings have proven themselves capable
    of devising and then abiding by their own rules independent of religious
    decrees ( As the examples I have cited earlier show), within which an
    individual or society can pursue their varied interests with differing
    values yet maintain general peace and stability, then there is no longer any
    need to posit any perceived higher moral authority. The Universal
    Declarations of Human Rights is one such example of the reflection of the
    common shared moral values of humanity. <b>Only when someone posits a law
    higher than what is already agreed to by humanity solely on the basis of
    common sense perception of what is good and effective for humanity, need any
    questions be raised --for it is only THEN that an explanation or
    justification of such a moral base is necessary. The burden of proof belongs
    on the one who steps outside the ordinary and common sense way in which
    morals are derived, not on the one who continues to keep his or her morals
    and values in conformity with that democratically established.</b></p>

    <p align="justify">Recently in NFB, Mr. K. Rahman has made several despotic
    comments that are utterly ridiculous, unfounded, illogical and deserve
    strong rebuttals. <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/morality_atheist_perspective.htm">Avijit</a>,
    <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/does_religion_define_morality_aparthib.htm">Aparthib
    Zaman</a> and Shabbir Ahmed did splendid job of rebutting those hilarious
    logic of Mr. Rahman. Because of the ridiculous writing style of Mr. Rahman (<i>not
    putting quotations inside</i> <i>inverted coma</i>), readers had difficulty
    in understanding, as to, who was talking what in his article. However, it is
    a well-known fact that there is an erroneous common perspective in general
    that religion makes human beings perfect, kind hearted and impeccable
    person.</p>
    <p align="justify">This is only a century-old hypothesis, which has no
    practical impact at all. Sometimes ago, Mr. Aparthib Zaman wrote an
    excellent article in this forum with strong inconvertible logic and
    philosophical arguments to prove that religion has no strong basis to make a
    human being moral. But, Mr. Rahman is telling us completely a different
    story. According to him, all religious persons are good humans and
    conversely, non-religious persons are bad humans. In this essay, I shall use
    some historical facts to prove that Mr. Rahman’s theory has flaws and
    incongruity.</p>
    <u><b>
    <p align="justify">As Mr. Rahman says:</p>
    </b></u><font color="#008080">
    <p align="justify">&quot;<i>I was not talking about any tom, dick or harry.
    I was talking about two institutions, i.e., atheism and theism [strictly
    speaking: ISLAM]. Islam in its institutional form of authority in ISLAMIC
    EMPIRE simply did not commit any genocide or demonstrate murderous behavior.
    Atheism appeared in institutional form in COMMUNISM and was a deadly blood
    thirsty institution</i>&quot;.</p>
    </font>
    <p align="justify">Let us examine how Mr. Rahman is right in his assertion.
    According to his theory of institution—all communist countries are grouped
    into one institution-<b>COMMUNISM</b>. On the other hand, all religious
    countries are grouped into one institution-<b>THEISM. </b>Let me take first:</p>
    <b><i><u>
    <p align="justify">THE INSTITUTION OF COMMUNISM</u> (ATHEISTS):</p>
    <font color="#008080">
    <p align="justify">The following were the communist countries: USSR, Poland,
    Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, China,
    Vietnam, North Korea, Cambodia, Cuba etc. were ruled (some are still ruling)
    by the constitution/doctrine of the Communism. As per I know the
    constitution or doctrines of the Communism is the best possible pro-people
    constitution in the whole world. Even the most pro-people constitution of
    USA is of no comparison with the constitution of Communism. Truly speaking,
    in theory, constitutional decrees of Communism are much more pro-peoples
    than the constitutional decrees of Capitalist America, although practically
    it has been proven quite opposite.</font></i> </b>Nevertheless, the book of
    the Communist Constitution never ever contains any order to: kill, hate,
    oppress, subjugate and punish any believers, non-believers or other race and
    creeds.</p>
    <p align="justify">According to Mr. Rahman communism means an institution of
    atheists and this institution therefore should commit killings and every
    countries under communism must have killing fields throughout the country,
    because they are atheists. Now world knows—<b>only some particular leader
    (not every leaders) in USSR, China and Cambodia</b> had committed some
    political killings, again those killings did happen only under certain
    particular dictators like Stalin, Palpot, Mao Tse-tung, etc. Even in
    Russia—other rulers like Nikita Khrushchev, Gorbachev and others did not
    commit mass killings. Therefore, we did not see any general trend of
    killings in every Communist country.</p>
    <p align="justify">A vast majority of Communist countries (mentioned above)
    never had any such political mass killings. Cuban President Fiddle Castro is
    ruling Cuba for forty some years by strict Communist constitution. Was there
    any evidence that Fiddle Castro did mass killings in Cuba? Certainly not! So
    where does stand the very ludicrous theory of Mr. Rahman that, Communism
    must commit mass killings?<b> </b>Besides, mass killings in communist
    countries were never documented like the killing fields of two World Wars;
    hence most of them were simply propagandas by Capitalist world during the
    Cold War period<b>. </b>Now let us draw our attention to the history of
    those countries ruled by theists.</p>
    <u><b>
    <p align="justify">THE INSTITUTION OF THEISM (BELIEVRS</b></u>):</p>
    <i><b>
    <p align="justify">Let us take some prominent Strict Islamic Countries</b></i>:
    Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Sudan whose constitution is Islamic
    Shariaat (Quran and Hadiths). <b>In the constitution (Quran and Hadiths) of
    these Islamic countries—there are plenty of scriptural (constitutional)
    orders to: kill , oppress, subjugate, punish all non-believers, other
    believers. Also there are plenty of orders to suppress/oppress/subjugate
    women and minorities (Dhimmis). <font color="#800080">So what have we seen
    in these three countries of strong believers? Let us check one at a time:</p>
    </font>
    <p align="justify">In Iran</b>: After the Islamic revolution Ayatollah
    Ruhulollah Khomeni immediately killed (by execution) half a million
    so-called anti-revolutionist Iranians. He killed another million young boys
    during the eight years of war with Iraq. After that this Islamic regime of
    strong believers continued endless killings and tortures to tens of
    thousands of innocent Iranians in the name of saving Islam and Allah.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">In Saudi Arabia</b>: A total despotic tyrannical
    dictatorship with sporadic killings by beheading, maiming, tortures of its
    citizen is routine. Oppression and subjugation of women and minority (of
    course no minority exists) are rampant.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">In Afghanistan</b>: Needless to mention that this true
    Islamic country is the reminiscent of modern day Caliphate of 7<sup>th</sup>
    century Arab. Killings, tortures, subjugating, suppressing people’s
    rights, suppressing women’s and minority’s rights are routine. In short
    one can say that—no civilized people can live in Afghanistan today. This
    country is the most black spot of the Islamic world today!</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">In Sudan: Since </b>the inception of Islamic Govt. in
    Sudan, sectarian fights between Muslims and Christians are rampant, which
    had taken the life of tens of thousands of innocent human beings.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">SO WHAT ARE WE OBSERVING IN THESE THEISTS RULED COUNTRIES
    MR. RAHMAN?</p>
    <u><i>
    <p align="justify">Let us take some prominent countries ruled by the rulers
    who is a believer or theist</i></u></b>:</p>
    <p align="justify">Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Pakistan, Uganda, etc., are
    some countries ruled by believers (and not by an atheist).</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Germany</b>: In the Second World War, Adolph Hitler
    killed an estimated 20-30 million peoples. Hitler was a Christian and strong
    believer (<b>not an atheist</b>) yet Hitler was a demon diabolic killer.
    When he became the glorious leader of Germany, Adolph Hitler thought that
    God’s invisible hands were behind his success. He incited his young
    followers to kill all Jews and Communists to please Christian God. (<i><b>Personal
    diary of Adolph Hitler by: Adolph Hitler—Translated by Rukhsini Proshad
    Battacherji</b> ).</p>
    </i><b>
    <p align="justify">Indonesia<i>:</i> </b>A Muslim Country having rulers who
    believed in God’s existence unlike an atheist who does not believe in
    existence of any personal God. What have we seen there? Does any body
    remember Indonesian Military coup in 1965?</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In October 1965, more than one million Communist workers and peasants
    were brutally slaughtered in the name of saving democracy and Islam by a
    organized army coup led by General Suharto, which swept aside Indonesia and
    simply wiped out Communist Party (PKI) within a few days of massive
    killings. In this cruel ordeal—Indonesian Mullahs gave full hand supports
    to General Suharto. These were all THEIST PEOPLE INDEED WHO DID THE KILLINGS
    IN Indonesia. Where stands the theory of Mr. Rahman?</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Pakistan: </b>In 1971, during the glorious Independence
    struggle of Bangalees, Pakistani soldiers who were theist/believers killed
    three million innocent peoples (Adam Santaan), raped 250,000 women and
    destroyed Billions of dollars worth property. All most 98% percent of all
    Mullahs, Maulanas, Madrassah students of Bangladesh helped Pak army in this
    brutal killing, and raping of Bangalees. <b>Tikka, Niazi, Yahya</b> they all
    were Muslims and believers indeed. So, where lies your theory Mr. Rahman?</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Iraq: </b>President Saddam Hussein who is known as a
    diabolic killer is a true believer. To many a Muslims, he is a Islamic hero
    who fought, or fighting infidels for the cause of Islam. This demon,
    diabolic Muslim killed tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi peoples. He used
    weapons of mass destruction (Chemical weapons) to kill several Kurd villages
    where he annihilated thousands of human beings. He even killed his own
    son-in-laws, nephews and other nearest relatives, and still continued
    assassinating peoples who opposes him. Where lies your theory, Mr. Rahman?</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Uganda</b>: Dada Idi Amin of Uganda was a true
    Muslim/believer who slaughtered tens of thousands of peoples. It was told
    that, he was a diabolic terrorizing ruler who was also a cannibal who loved
    to eat human liver and flesh. So, where lies your theory, may I ask you Mr.
    Rahman?</p>
    <b><u><i>
    <p align="justify">Now let us deal with the Institution of the Prophets:</p>
    </i></u>
    <p align="justify">Prophet Moses: </b>was a blamed for killing human beings
    who fought wars and killed peoples at war and also killed people who
    surrendered to him.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Jesus: </b>Jesus was an extremely kind-hearted forgiving
    Prophet. This prophet asked to forgive all sinners, love all sinners, never
    kill any body, never take any revenge, and love your archenemy. Even love
    and forgive thieves and prostitutes. He used to advise his disciples to
    conquer enemy’s hearts by love and forgiveness.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Muhammad: </b>This Prophet of Islam<b>, </b>though in his
    early life was a peaceful, honest guy, begun his venture of establishing his
    new religion Islam by force. From the very early period he started a
    collision course with the pagan Arabs and used his sword to overcome all
    resistances from his rivals. In many wars, and in many secret conspiracies
    he killed tens of thousands of peoples who opposed Islam. He hired killers
    to annihilate his rivals by luring peoples with the dazzling heavenly
    pleasures and happiness. He even killed surrendered unarmed war prisoners in
    the Khyber war.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Buddha:</b> was a Prophet who never killed any life
    (Humans, Animals, Insects etc.). He asked his followers to love, forgive and
    never kill even a Mosquito.</p>
    <p align="justify">So what should be our honest and sincere conclusion by
    the above survey of world’s history? Here in the Prophetic institution
    also we have seen no consistency at all. We neither can claim that anybody
    who is a Prophet should be a killer/demon, nor can we say that anybody who
    is a Prophet should be a merciful, kind hearted benevolent human being!</p>
    <p align="justify">When Aparthib Zaman and others pointed their fingers
    towards Yahya and Tikka khan’s cruelties then Mr. Rahman said, &quot;<i>Yahya
    or Tikka khan did not represent any Islamic institution. They represented a
    traditional power institution&quot;. </i>Well Mr. Rahman, could you tell us
    why Stalin, Polpot and Mao Tse-tung could not be considered just as the
    likes of Tikka khan, Yahya who also represented a traditional power
    institution?</p>
    <p align="justify">In his flip-flop sidetracking of real answer to those
    questions asked by Shabbir Ahmed, Aparthib Zaman and others, Mr. Rahman
    tried to get excused by saying: &quot;well, Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan is
    not the real Islam!&quot; <b>Now the question is what is real Islam? And</b>
    <b>where lies the real Islam?</b> Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia are being
    ruling by pure Islamic Shariaat (Quran and Sunnah). <b><font color="#ff0000">My
    fervent request to Mr. Rahman or any other Islamists -- please, could you
    give us just </font><font color="#0000ff"><u>FIVE good reasons/criteria</u></font><font color="#ff0000">,
    as to why, we should not call Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia a true Islamic
    Country? Your FIVE reasons must have supports from Quran and hadiths.</p>
    </font><u>
    <p align="justify">Conclusion:</p>
    </u></b>
    <p align="justify">Truth of the matter is — to be a tyrant killer, one
    does not have to be either an atheist, nor theism is the prerequisite
    qualification for a killer. More or less, people of both camps (atheism and
    theism) could turn into a despotic tyrant killer anywhere and everywhere in
    this world. Modern science has proved with well-founded theory that, killer
    instinct of a human being lies in his genetic make-up. And this genetic
    predisposing factor may get even stronger/worst by political strength and
    dictatorship. Nevertheless, a careful survey of world history will tell
    exactly the opposite of what Mr. Rahman asserted in his first essay that
    atheism insist killing spree in human minds.</p>
    <p align="justify">To the contrary, the world history will tell us that it
    was the THEISM incited killing spree among the people for thousands of
    years. THEISM vehemently divided the human race for thousands of years
    causing tremendous harms to humans. Religions or belief systems of various
    types are the most prominent cause of blood shed in the mankind’s history.
    <font color="#800080"><b>No other single factor killed so many peoples than
    the total number of peoples killed by the religion, for the religion and of
    the religion in the whole mankind’s history</b></font>. Even today,
    religions are the main factor of sectarian killings in Pakistan, Sudan,
    Philippine, Indonesia and many other countries of the world.</p>
    <p align="justify">Even the social oppressions and economic corruption runs
    high in those countries ruled by theist person (Pakistan, Bangladesh,
    Nigeria, India, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, etc.), but social
    oppressions/corruption are much less in those countries ruled by atheists
    rulers (Singapore, Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand etc.). I have a bitter
    personal true observation that tells me that the <b>THEIST</b> people are
    more inclined to commit crime than <b>ATHEIST</b> people, which I will bring
    in this forum sometimes next. Let me conclude this essay with a famous
    quote:</p>
    <i><font color="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or
    without it, you would have good people doing good things and evil people
    doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes
    religion</b></font>.<font color="#ff0000">&quot;</font>-- <b>by Nobel
    Laureate physicist Steven Weinberg</b></i>:</p>
