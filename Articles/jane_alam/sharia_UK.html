	</b><span style="color:#333333">It is quite an awful, unexpected, 
	disappointing, heartbreaking and finally disgusting phenomenon to the 
	enlightened people of the modern age to hear the news of the institution of 
	Sharia court, in a secular-democratic state, like UK, for adjudicating the 
	family disputes of the Muslim. In the epoch of such utmost culmination of 
	science &amp; rationalism, when the rationalism, as scientific values, 
	encroaching all time-bared backward &amp; tradition-trodden superstitious values 
	&amp; ideas of the societies gradually, as the inevitable order of the day, then 
	this perpetration of the UK government is nothing but obviously a pitiful 
	acquiescence of a secular-democratic state to the religious bigots, 
	upholding the banner of medieval thoughts. Or it may be a ploy of some 
	hidden agents to refuel the ongoing insurgence of fundamentalism throughout 
	the world. </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><b><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><b><span style="color:#333333">What are the Sharia 
	Court &amp; law: </span></b><span style="color:#333333">The court, which will 
	adjudicate all the disputes placed before it as per the provisions of the 
	Sharia laws is the Sharia court. The<b> </b>Sharia laws are the collection 
	of all religious rules &amp; regulations, which the Muslim are bound to follow. 
	The Holy Scripture Quran is the primary source of these rules &amp; regulations. 
	And then Hadith- the sayings of prophet Mohammed and his performance, called 
	Sunna is the next vital source&nbsp; &amp; finally some consensus of the Muslim 
	scholars &amp; legal analogy made by them may be termed as the derived source of 
	some of these rules &amp; regulations. In these rules &amp; regulations, there are 
	some, which are to be followed only at the time of religious ritual &amp; 
	worship, which have nothing to do with the society.&nbsp; But there are some 
	rules &amp; regulations originated from the above-mentioned sources, which laid 
	down provisions to regulate the relation amongst the members of the family &amp; 
	with their society, their mode of inheritance, attitude &amp; behavior towards 
	other religious group, economic transaction &amp; business etc., which have a 
	vital role to play in the socio-economic formation of the societies. </span>
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Hence, now to adopt the 
	Sharia laws for a society in this modern era, the most fundamental question 
	we have to meet, is not where these laws have come from or what are the 
	sources of these laws, but whether all these rules &amp; regulations 
	collectively known as Sharia are still competent to cope with the present 
	need of the modern societies? Let us try to examine it.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><b><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><b><span style="color:#333333">In regards to the 
	competence of Sharia law: </span></b><span style="color:#333333">First of 
	all, we can have an investigation in general, about the competence of the 
	customs &amp; canons of all the religions. There is no denial the fact that, a</span>ll 
	the religions, still followed by the different groups of the people in 
	different countries of the world, had come in to existence in the ancient 
	Dark-Age, much more earlier then the commencement of the modern 
	civilization. Then in fact, the people were very much vulnerable before the 
	mystical nature for their very primitive weapons &amp; means of production and 
	lack of knowledge and hence there was no any dominant social-conscience in 
	the ancient society of that Dark-Age. Religions then began to emerge as the 
	belief in super-naturalism of those innocent, ignorant &amp; helpless people. In 
	course of time, that religious philosophy had become to be the main 
	social-conscience in the medieval age. Reasonably the entire religious 
	creeds had been preached being based on faith and belief of the contemporary 
	people to address the need of that contemporary time and hence all those 
	canons could not surpass the knowledge &amp; belief of the contemporary people. 
	But due to gradual development in the weapons and means of production, 
	capitalist mode of society had begun to emerge in the womb of the feudal 
	society, science had begun to occupy bit by bit the role of 
	social-conscience, of course not spontaneously, but through the severe 
	struggle of knowledge &amp; reasons against the belief &amp; ignorance. In the 
	consequences, after thousands of years, almost all customs &amp; canons of all 
	religions hopelessly became obsolete, absurd and ineffective to address the 
	need of the modern society-much more advanced, complicated &amp; diversified 
	than the ancient one &amp; rather have become to be detrimental to the liberties 
	&amp; human rights of the modern people in all respect &amp; also ridiculous in 
	comparison to the values &amp; ideas of the modern societies. At present, we 
	cant think of a modern society without some basic principles, such as,<span style="color:#333333"> 
	democracy, secularism, liberalism, fundamental rights, freedom of speech, 
	thought, conscience &amp; religion.</span>&nbsp; <span style="color:#333333">It is 
	uncalled for to mention that, no religious customs or canons -whether 
	Islamic, Christian, Buddhist, Hindus or of any other religion, can cope with 
	these basic concepts of modern civilization. Rather, it is not an 
	exaggeration to say that, all of those religious customs or canons have 
	already become to be repugnant to the essence of these entire modern 
	concepts which modern society is based on. </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Verdana">This is the same case in 
	respect of religion Islam. The canons or rules as set in the Sharia, are not 
	now in conformity with the present need of the man. Today, Sharia has become 
	a potent tool in the hand of Islamic Jihadist for the violation of human 
	rights, oppression and exploitation in the name of Allah. Sharia has become 
	a weapon for Islamic inquisition in some Islamic countries of Africa and 
	Asia, especially in the Gulf countries. Sharia does not recognize equal 
	rights of all human beings regardless of religion or belief. Sharia accords 
	second-class status to non Muslims. The Sharia laws clearly do not place 
	men and women on level ground in seeking justice, acting as witness, in 
	inheritance and divorce. Hence, in the then Pakistan, in 1961, Muslim Sharia 
	laws had been modified by an ordinance named, the Muslim Family law 
	Ordinance 1961 in spite of the vehement opposition of Islamic mullah, which 
	is still in vogue in Bangladesh. And set of laws stipulated in that 
	ordinance obviously is not in compliance with the Sharia law. Subsequently 
	some more ordinances had been promulgated in the decades of 80s in 
	Bangladesh, laying down the provision of family court, prohibition of dowry, 
	prevention of cruelty to women, modifying a little bit in the law of 
	inheritance in Bangladesh, also not in compliance with the so-called Sharia 
	laws. Rather, many customs, such as Ella marriage (intercepting marriage to 
	allow a divorcee to remarry her divorcing husband) has been prohibited in 
	that ordinance. As per sharia law, a Muslim can divorce his wife at any time 
	without assigning any reason, only by uttering the word Talak three times 
	consecutively.&nbsp; But in the above-mentioned ordinances, it is not so easy now 
	to divorce ones wife without following a legal procedure, such as giving 
	her a written notice of divorce, sending it to a council of arbitrator and 
	having positive consent from this arbitration council, after a hearing. As 
	per Islamic Sharia law, a Mohammedan can have four wives at a time, but 
	according to new ordinances, no one can marry a second wife without written 
	permission from the arbitration council, to get which, one is to submit a 
	prayer before it and convincing the council his genuine necessity of second 
	marriage, which is also repugnant to the provision of the Sharia law. 
	Besides, the modern law of evidence is not allowed in the Sharia act. Rather 
	to combat the testimony of a male witness, testimony of two female are 
	necessary which is contrary to the provision of the modern civil law and 
	severely detrimental to the rights of woman and also discriminatory to the 
	concept of gender equality. It is due to the so-called sharia act, that the 
	man &amp; woman are still being executed to death by stoning after putting 
	him/her in to the ground up to the armpits for their alleged adultery, which 
	is still running in the country like Iran, Nigeria and other Arabian 
	countries. Strangely enough, the allegation of adultery of a husband against 
	his wife is enough to execute the wife. Can it be endorsed by any civilized 
	nation?<b> </b>So, it may be concluded that all out attempt of bringing the 
	Sharia laws &amp; establishing Sharia court is the last though not least 
	endeavor to erect the uncross-able impediment on the way to secularism &amp; 
	modernism for the Muslim community at least. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Verdana"><b>Its objects &amp; consequences:
	</b>&nbsp;It is very much mysterious and paradoxical as well, to find a secular 
	country like UK, dominated by Christian majority in number, to comply with 
	the irrational &amp; dogmatic urge of Islamic bigots by instituting a Sharia 
	Court, a judicial system of medieval age, to adjudicate the disputes of 
	modern age in its land creating a parallel judicial system. It is dubious 
	that there may have a deep-down scheme of fundamentalist hiding within the 
	administration of the UK government to blow the wind- speed in the sail of 
	fundamentalist campaign or it may be a willful contemplation to keep the 
	Muslim community, already backward in all respects of life to lagging behind 
	forever or it may be a modest but determined beginning of the deviation 
	towards fundamentalism.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Now, the institution of 
	Sharia Court in UK, in any form, with whatsoever jurisdiction, in the epoch 
	of an unprecedented insurgence of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the 
	world and their massive campaign and pressure to implement so-called Islamic 
	laws in their native countries, obviously will inspire and encourage 
	fundamentalist to boost-up &amp; refuel their blood-thirsty Jihad (Religious 
	war) &amp; it will exert more pressure upon the Muslim countries, still fighting 
	for democracy with all their limitation, making very difficult for them to 
	sustain it. Furthermore, this phenomenon will create confusion amongst the 
	innocent peace-loving majority of the moderate Muslims, in all Muslim 
	dominated countries about the necessity &amp; competence of Sharia court as 
	demanded by the fundamentalist.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><b><span style="color:#333333">What is to be done:
	</span></b><span style="color:#333333">It has now become to be the 
	historical obligation of all secular progressive forces, regardless of 
	political, social, cultural &amp; human rights organisatons to launch a massive 
	propaganda and campaign like a vigorous cultural movement against this 
	perpetration of UK government, withstanding with the essence of its own 
	constitution and to make to raise the collective voices of the general 
	masses of UK along with the voices of international secular-progressive 
	forces, throughout the world. As because, this is not only the question of 
	establishing Sharia court in UK, Canada or somewhere else, but it is the 
	question whether the fundamentalism will win over the secularism.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">These sorts of attempt to 
	institute Sharia court in Some American &amp; European countries like Canada &amp; 
	UK are not separable from the fundamentalist uprising. Vigorous seminar, 
	discussion meeting, debate, mass-rally and demonstration be organised as the 
	prime tactics to boost up the propaganda with the slogans-fundamentalism 
	anywhere, is a severe threat to liberalism, democracy and human rights every 
	where, Humankind cant go back to the medieval age, Let there be light, 
	light, light, more light. Civilized progressive people of the world have 
	no scope to combat a bombardment of the terrorist with a counter 
	bombardment, but only to begin a philosophical &amp; psychological warfare, much 
	more persuasive then the bloody war,&nbsp; against their ardent belief &amp; 
	philosophy inspiring them to commit suicide in the fake hope of eternal 
	peace &amp; happiness in the heaven. Perhaps, this is the only way out to subdue 
	them, not the aggressive &amp; imperialist warfare of President Bush, which has 
	already proved to be futile.</span></font></p>
