    <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">“Only the civilized people 
    know the art of war” Generalissimo Chiang Kai Sek expressed during Chinese 
    civil war. It looks like tens thousands years of civilizing process is 
    nothing but fighting, killing, maiming, injuring, damaging to dominate, 
    impose, exploit.<br>
    <br>
    If it is so, I think the time has come to say goodbye to civilization, it’s 
    time for humanization. <br>
    <br>
    Humanity is suffering immensely all around the globe; divided, pitted, 
    fragmented. Bleeding like Jesus Christ as shown in the movie, “The passion 
    of Christ.” All of us subjected to the merciless ancient art of survival, 
    the law of animal kingdom is persistent at every label of societies at every 
    corner on earth. Human dignity is not pursued; the moral standard has been 
    set on course to accommodate severity, cruelty, and barbarism. <br>
    <br>
    We are living with thousands of years of old legacies, invented by man who 
    didn’t have the slightest idea about earth and the universe, and the modus 
    operandy of nature. Men were tremendously battling to survive in a world 
    they understood little. With their little knowledge and understanding they 
    did perceived pictures, and set on course guide lines to run whole 
    societies, states, empires; which eventually engulfed continents as the 
    centuries ticked. Unfortunately enough, those immature perceptions still 
    remain as the prime models to regulate billions of lives around the glove.
    <br>
    <br>
    To, state it bluntly, human civilization still crawling like an immature 
    child, with no clear picture about the purpose and the ultimate destiny of 
    our existence. Practically we’re living around elusions. We’re at a 
    merciless war with ourselves, and with everything that surrounds us. <br>
    <br>
    It seems there is no freedom from those legacies. No one is capable of 
    thinking other wise, thinking of a global human society, based on the right 
    perceptions derived from the knowledge of scientific discoveries. Along with 
    the right conceptions of our temporary existence on earth, and living it 
    reasonably, logically for the better of all, eliminating all the ego 
    factors, sense of superiority, excessive and unnecessary consummation. <br>
    <br>
    We are here to live it, not to use our existence as a platform to fight, 
    shed blood, advocate violence or any other dubious means to establish one 
    man or a group of man over others. This bickering, feuding, unnecessary 
    spoiling of precious resources is a fact of shame, a crime. We must 
    understand and accept the fact that entire humanity shares a common past, a 
    common dilemma of subsistence, and a common future in a grave. We must break 
    free from the legacies of faiths, lies, and imaginations for the common good 
    of all. <br>
    <br>
    Faiths of the masses always played central role in forming and deforming of 
    political structures in many parts of the world. In fact religions and 
    politics ran hand in hand in close collaboration still the trend is ongoing. 
    Religious affiliation of a certain population is still the central 
    ingredient of a state. The state of Israel is the latest most influential, 
    and embarrassing debacle of all time. <br>
    <br>
    This single event of inception and the subsequent struggle to preserve and 
    enlarge this entity influenced the entire world in a way never seen in 
    history. Jews arrogance, random use of superior military might, and mindless 
    manipulation of US political circus through monopolized influences pitted 
    the civilizations at collision course, Islam as a whole is being victimized 
    as the odd man around. One fifth of humanity has been unfairly portrayed as 
    bloodthirsty villains through unjust manipulation of Jews controlled mass 
    media in the USA. <br>
    <br>
    Unfair Jews behavior fueled anger among Muslim communities around the world, 
    and subsequently helped to raise militancy. Islamic militancy helped in 
    promoting other religious militancy’s; among these most notable is the Hindu 
    militancy, the rise of Christian right in the USA. Creation of Israel in 
    fact reversed the progressive march of civilization away from religions, 
    into religious militancy. Liberalizing ideals of seventies and eighties were 
    reversed into demoralizing religious militancy around the glove, including 
    in the USA.<br>
    <br>
    Instead of progression of civilization in line with the advances of science 
    and technology toward a more universal culture of tolerance, sympathy, and 
    humanness, religions influencing to instill militancy, separation, violence, 
    blood bath, militarism, and barbarism. After the fall of communism, all most 
    all the major owes of today’s world is directly or indirectly has been 
    created by the religious hypocrisy. An unnecessary element in societies, 
    it’s creating misunderstanding, grievances, intolerance, division, and 
    destruction. <br>
    <br>
    If there were no religions, there wouldn’t have been any Israel, any 
    militant violence; a lot of warfare would have been avoided. People would 
    not be dieing in the Middle East, Sri Lanka, Philippines, India, and in many 
    other parts of the world. There wouldn’t have been any Sep. eleven, Bali and 
    Madrid train bombings, or might any terrorism at all. <br>
    <br>
    These trends should have reversed a long time ago to adjust with the 
    evolving enriched knowledge and understanding about life, nature, and the 
    universe. But some thing went wrong in course of history. It seems 
    explorative human minds have been arrested and kept captive by a tremendous 
    social pressure group under the umbrella of religious organs and 
    collaborative state machineries. <br>
    <br>
    Humanity lost at least a thousand plus years since the arrival of the latest 
    life style formula of Islam. Logic seems to have lost out to rhetoric’s, and 
    the trend is still continuing to rack havoc on all living human souls, 
    captivating their inspirations, reason to live and die. <br>
    <br>
    The knowledge is there, the explanations are there, the evidences are there, 
    and these are universally accepted, practiced, propagated, studied. But 
    alas, these affairs are contained with in a range of a few fortunate 
    scholars, intellectuals, academicians, scientists, and researchers. The rest 
    are living hopelessly around the same old wall of ignorance, thick and 
    impenetrable.<br>
    <br>
    In this laser camp no one seems to bother about the facts and discoveries. 
    Thousands of years of painstaking efforts of many have gone nuts. Why? Why 
    humanity can’t come to terms with the reality? Because of our existing 
    socio, religious, political, economic and educational systems. All these are 
    running hand in hand as complementary to one another. A thick, impenetrable 
    wall has been raised around human psyche over many millenniums of ignorance. 
    It could not be erased overnight by any revolution; it is deep in our 
    psyche. <br>
    <br>
    Science is advancing with mind-boggling speed, driven by a few man to 
    generate profit and domination. Besides enjoying the benefits of new 
    products and facilities, essentially most of us remain imprisoned to the 
    old, out dated, destructive ideals and faiths. Recently Bush junior 
    envisioned of sending man to Mars, What a mind-blowing vision! But 
    unfortunately he still every morning starts with crossing his dirty fingers, 
    bowing to the legacies of an era long rendered as useless fantasy. His march 
    to Mars is to extend the technological superiority of a state over other. 
    His ideas are an act of war; his very existence is a disgrace to humanity.
    <br>
    <br>
    The president of the mightiest nation on earth is as much ignorant and ego 
    centric as any other man plying the streets. Poor civilization! Civilization 
    housed it self inside a huge wrestling ring, inhuman, barbaric, filthy, 
    stinking, nauseating. But very few realize this. All are trigger-happy 
    living with these discrepancies. In fact whole societies are designed to run 
    around fighting, blood bath, war, atrocities. All that matter is victory, 
    imposing of one’s will against another, exploit others to enrich some. We’re 
    all playing natures game of survival of the fittest. <br>
    <br>
    Nobody is capable of thinking that we can live humanly, rationally with out 
    fighting, blood shedding, killing, maiming, torturing, exploiting. In an 
    ideal world state with out police, armies, trained dogs. Live together, live 
    with each other, and live in peace and harmony. Live for the sake of living, 
    not for the sake of seeking superiority. Not to impose one over another, 
    living an equally benefiting life for all. As a community of humanity, 
    living together in harmony. <br>
    <br>
    All we need is to understand the working of nature, break free from the 
    shackles of religious affiliations to think logically-reasonably. Sweden is 
    far ahead in this direction than the rest of the world. There even the prime 
    minister walks around among masses with out any guards. If Sweden can 
    achieve this why rest of the world can’t? It’s not a pipe dream, or a 
    utopia, its achievable. Humanity has to go far beyond present Swedish model.
    <br>
    <br>
    Evolutionary evidences are there over hundred plus years, and the skies have 
    opened up a long time ago to see through the thick glasses of telescopes. 
    Scientists, archeologists, biologists arguing with evidence of modern human 
    beings arrival at about seventy to eighty thousands of years earlier. But 
    the oldest legacy of faiths doesn’t have a life span of more than five 
    thousands of years. So, before that time I suppose, Gods were taking rest in 
    the heavens, waiting for the appropriate time to descend and capture human 
    minds. Silly enough to be Tom kids fantasy. We have to be brave and face 
    squarely the facts of our emergence from the nose of science. This will 
    remove the mask of ignorance.<br>
    <br>
    After evolving from apes humanity survived the onslaught of natural odds, 
    and progressed; thrived by the aid of superior brainpower and physical 
    abilities. But still lived in nature, along with all the other animals in 
    nature. Surviving on natural food chain, no shelter overhead to avoid sun, 
    rain, storm, and no security measure against the attacks of other mightier 
    animals that lived along side them in nature. Natural odds and dangers 
    taught them to live together in groups, these groups eventually increased in 
    number. Human communities started to shape up. <br>
    <br>
    The start of real progress starting from Stone Age to community-based 
    societies took many thousands of years of evolution. Community based 
    societies are the starting point of modern history, from where feudalism 
    started to emerge in to organized societies with political structures of 
    governance. It took several thousands of years to loose free from feudalism 
    into the age of science and industry, and the eventual emergence of 
    democratic form of governance. <br>
    <br>
    Even though communism made a century of experimentation, it lost ground due 
    to immaturity of human civilization, not because it was inaccurate, even 
    though it was certainly incomplete. Unfortunate Karl Marx was born long 
    before Freud, so, he missed the point of understanding human psychology. Any 
    way, democracy and capitalism won the day, which fits perfectly with the 
    make up of present day human psychology. This state of human psychology is 
    really in a state of concern, as it is exclusively preoccupied with the age 
    of feudalism, or the age of darkness. This is hugely disturbing, 
    denigrating, conscious depleting factor.<br>
    <br>
    It’s time that human civilization takes a deep look at it self, and try to 
    reinvent to adjust with the persistent time, and the advances made upon 
    since the beginning of civilization. We did accumulated at least five 
    thousands years of knowledge, as history propelled us from Stone Age to 
    space age; from here we have to move up to the age of reason. But 
    unfortunately, the reason is in recession, human mind is irrationally bonded 
    by the ideals of feudal era, the era of darkness. It’s time that humanity 
    breaks free from yesterday and start to live with today’s realities. <br>
    <br>
    It’s a small world, recent scientific advances made it even smaller into a 
    virtual village, the global village, at least theoretically. Many in the 
    east and west alike fondly call it to identify the miracles of technology, 
    and the way it is bringing together people from different parts of the 
    world. But it’s only an illusion, sweet mouthful of a word. In fact the 
    world is squarely divided into lines of continents, religions, languages, 
    states, tribal areas, clans. <br>
    <br>
    First world, second world, third world and the fourth world; Whites, blacks, 
    browns, yellows, mixed. Wars, famines, malnutrition’s are daily fares in 
    some parts of the world. People are dieing in war, war of nations, in 
    sectarian violence, in war of independence, so called liberation, secession, 
    and autonomy. <br>
    <br>
    People are fighting for race, religion, and linguistic identity. People are 
    dieing in famine, in civil war; hundreds of thousands of children die in 
    malnutrition, another millions go to bed with the burning sensation of 
    hunger. Latest sad example is Darfur, Sudan. <br>
    <br>
    Man is out rooted from their own houses, denied their rights to cultivate 
    their own land, murdered, maimed simply because of different race and 
    religion. In this earth of plenty, hundreds of millions did never have the 
    chance to attend a school, couldn’t receive any enlightening touch of 
    knowledge. Human children struggle to survive in street corners, fight with 
    animals for rotten foods. Should not we be ashamed of these facts? <br>
    <br>
    All this is huge indignity, and monumental shame to all of us. It is time 
    that humanity wake up and realizes all of us share the same roots of origin. 
    We are the product of earth and the universe, natural process of 
    evolutionary law, and we are not indebted to any entity greater than our own 
    existence. We must understand all those thousands of years of history were 
    based on plain imaginary and ignorance. All those legacies we are so proud 
    about were squarely based on cruelty, indignity and imagination, and on our 
    insecurity, and on not being able to understand the workings of nature. <br>
    <br>
    Since humanity came out from the wilderness, and started to live apart from 
    the rest of the animals, along with the pace of time we started to loose 
    relation with our roots to nature. Man started to feel superior over other 
    animals due to the fact of superior capabilities. So, man started to look 
    for a different identity. Humanity lost the sense of belonging, the true 
    identity. So, they were confused, and hugely insecure amid natural settings, 
    which they understood little. They were helpless in natural surroundings. 
    The rains, storms, floods, rivers, sun, moon, the stars, and the near by 
    animals, vicious, mightier, at times attacking and killing man. They did not 
    have the slightest idea from where did they emerged. They were capable of 
    thinking and exchanging thoughts in between them selves, but they did not 
    have the required knowledge, or any explanation of these phenomena’s. <br>
    <br>
    Their insecurities and helplessness drove them into believing that those 
    natural phenomena’s and the mightier, vicious animals are some how more 
    powerful than themselves. They reasoned when these forces are angry they 
    become destructive. Some imaginative people came out with the idea of 
    soothing and appeasing these forces, so they don’t become angry and 
    destructive. How to appease them? Animals were provided with food, some of 
    the animals were contained and eventually domesticated. This modest success 
    drove the point of appeasing beyond. The legacies of faith took root. <br>
    <br>
    The process of appeasing seen, unseen, unexplained, unknown power began to 
    take place. As the human journey of progression from natural set up to so 
    called civilizing process advanced, the fears of unknown natural phenomena’s 
    remained intact and increased by the day. <br>
    <br>
    The color and extend of appeasing these forces increasingly began to take 
    abstract forms, early human societies put a lot of emphasize on these 
    matters. So with the aid of rest of the society a powerful and revered 
    special class emerged exclusively to perform the duties of appeasing 
    destructive, imagine boggling natural phenomena’s. Insecurities borne out of 
    fear and lack of understanding set up human destiny to live forever 
    surrounded by walls of myth, religions emerged through these practices of 
    appeasing the power full and destructive elements in nature, which 
    eventually took shape in organized forms. <br>
    <br>
    Of course with the active help of ruling classes all along. Aztec-Inca, 
    Hinduism, Buddhism, and the Chinese faiths emerged through these practices 
    of appeasing natural phenomena’s. The ruling classes were also ignorant; 
    fear griped, mortal human beings and they needed those religious guidelines 
    and disciplines to keep their empires on course, and these also gave them a 
    sense of moral duty to administer through war, slaughter, and barbarism. 
    This trend is still driving our civilization.<br>
    <br>
    The first group of organized religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and little 
    known Aztec-Inca faiths were based more on nature; these faiths didn’t put 
    up a single figure as all empowering entity. Instead they aimed at soothing 
    the various entities of nature, and emphasized more on self-realization, 
    improvement and nonviolent practice in the arena of life subsistence. So, 
    among these first wave of religions, Buddhism still remains the most 
    progressive of all faiths in substance as it relied more on self-improving 
    practices, rather than prescribing any all mighty power. Buddha didn’t, 
    couldn’t see any single creature, or creatures at all two thousands and five 
    hundreds years ago. <br>
    <br>
    The second wave of religions starting from Judaism, and later successive 
    Christianity and Islam, based in the deserts of middle east, where the 
    natural diverseness were minimal, progressed into abstract orientation, and 
    successfully alienated nature all together from faith and man. Man was cut 
    off from nature all together in these religions.<br>
    <br>
    Faiths were elevated in to the regions of unreachable heights, abstract 
    ideas as apostles or messengers were brought in to facilitate the 
    propagation of imaginations of individuals. In Islam it went up even more 
    one degree, as it was from the very beginning based on political power to 
    survive. Politics and subsequent violence were legitimized for the first 
    time in a religion. But it doesn’t mean it’s a violent faith. It was born 
    and breed through violence but professed peace. <br>
    <br>
    Since than a millennium and a half passed by. Natural phenomena’s were 
    explained, origin of life was discovered. But man remained attached to the 
    past.<br>
    <br>
    Charles Darwin for the first time in history explained in elaboration how 
    all this happened over hundreds of millions of years, the true fact of 
    emergence of life was explained. This is now almost two hundreds years. 
    Since than science and scientific knowledge of universe proved it beyond any 
    doubt that religions are pure imagination, invented by the insecurities, 
    fears, and helplessness of man.<br>
    <br>
    This is amazing, unbelievably disturbing, mind boggling how humanity is 
    being kept imprisoned by these faiths, and actually controlling the lives of 
    all most every one around the glove. The truth is out there in entirerity, 
    but we are still not capable of accepting, appreciating the true facts about 
    lives on earth. <br>
    <br>
    Even though these discoveries are elaborately taught in educational 
    institutes. Students study these hardly to pass the exam. And than go back 
    to temples, Churches, mosques to pray. They learn, but they don’t accept, or 
    can’t accept due to close psychological bond with these faiths. It’s like a 
    man walking on the street wearing a dark glass as not to see the 
    surroundings.<br>
    <br>
    Our knowledge has matured, but the problem is, this knowledge is kept 
    exclusively a reserved territory of a few people with exclusive education 
    and understanding. And this minority has no bearing on the rest of the 
    people. Science and knowledge has a different course, and rest of the 
    society running on the other side of the fact. Only accepting the fruits of 
    knowledge in every day life as different products to facilitate a better and 
    easier living, driven by the capitalist practices whose sole motive is 
    profit. <br>
    <br>
    Science and knowledge has been enslaved by an economic system to enrich 
    individuals. Science and knowledge has been all along kept captive to 
    accommodate the prevailing religious dogmas, political systems also played 
    all along the lines of these faiths.<br>
    <br>
    It seems like all those thousands of years of labor to know the truth about 
    life and nature were sacrificed to accommodate reigning philosophies, but 
    not to enrich the minds to accept the fact that we are the product of an 
    evolutionary process of universal dimension taking place since billions of 
    years. There are absolutely no gods and prophets. And human lives are no 
    different than any other animals on earth, except the higher brainpower and 
    maneuverability. Animals don’t pray, don’t have any gods, don’t have any 
    religion. Basically animals are our ancestors, and we are exclusively 
    related to them by blood and flesh. We are not indebted to any unseen power 
    for our existence, and that we don’t have to pray to any entity, fear any 
    entity. It is us who are our own masters.<br>
    <br>
    The acceptance of truth will free us from our insecurities, fears, and help 
    us to understand that all human beings are same in essence. That we all 
    share the same heritage, and no one is superior to another except in 
    physical proportion, capabilities of understanding different things. But our 
    feelings of sadness, happiness, and pains are same. Isn’t it shame full that 
    the people of various races still fighting for religions, and gods, which is 
    no more than pure imagination. <br>
    <br>
    It is essential to eradicate the hypocrisies of faiths to instill the sense 
    of commonness, erase the divisions in line of religions. Civility can’t 
    afford to loose any time any more, humans has suffered an enormous lot by 
    now of general ignorance and understanding of working of nature. Civility 
    now should take the most tantalizing, most important next step of jerking it 
    self off from the legacies of ignorance.<br>
    <br>
    In the past a few rogue communist states tried from top to impose the 
    scientific version of life, but failed miserably as just after the fall of 
    these political systems old thoughts emerged overnight. This shows the gross 
    immature nature of our civilization. So, it should be a systematic culture 
    of washing out the rubbish inherited through thousands of years, which are 
    firmly instilled in our psyche. <br>
    <br>
    Prevailing political, economic, social, religious systems are running hand 
    in hand. (But there is scope with in prevailing political institutions to 
    take necessary bold decisions to separate faiths from state machineries, 
    educational systems. Educational systems should be reorganized to educate 
    pupils from an early age about the true scientific explanation about life 
    and universe. What we initially require is rightly educated people to run 
    our political institutions, state machineries. Religions and religious 
    institutions should be denounced logically by the states as unnecessary 
    element.) <br>
    <br>
    Human psyche is implicitly influenced by these religious stigma over 
    thousands of years. This couldn’t be eradicated overnight by any revolution, 
    other than free propagation of scientific knowledge in all available media 
    and educational systems. It’s going to be very slow and tedious task. <br>
    <br>
    Civilization has to opt for a new direction based on pure knowledge of 
    science to truly understand the working of nature and universe to seek 
    freedom from all those bankrupt ideas of faiths. Men have to accept the 
    truth about the origin of life, accept the fact of evolution. That man was 
    not created by any single super power, but evolved through hundreds of 
    millions of years of natural process, through inter-action, reaction of 
    natural elements residing on this planet. We’ve to accept the fact that 
    animals now living in nature, in water or on earth are directly related to 
    our past, that we were not invented by any unknown supreme power, and that 
    this planet of ours is a very small part of an unimaginably huge universe. 
    Which man only recently started to explore.<br>
    <br>
    Scientific truth is the answer to the enormous owes that mankind suffering 
    from the unjustified association with bankrupt ideologies invented by 
    ancient thinkers in order to discipline, organize, instill justice among 
    people who did not understand, or understood very little about the 
    mysterious functioning of nature. <br>
    <br>
    These men were certainly the greatest in contemporary time, and sure they 
    meant to do well out of men. We should appreciate the efforts of these faith 
    builders as revered thinkers, philosophers, whose ideas has become 
    irrelevant long ago by advances made by science, and the relevant knowledge 
    or understanding about the works of nature and universe. But we have no 
    reason to follow them any longer.<br>
    <br>
    Humanity is suffering enormously around the glove due to our association 
    with these faiths. Basically these faiths are at the core of most miseries 
    suffering man today. All the wars, national inspirations, sectarian 
    violence, hunger, poverty are directly or indirectly associated with faiths.<br>
    <br>
    Just imagine what will happen once all the man on earth understands and 
    accepts the truth of our origin, that we all share the same roots. That all 
    of our ancestors emerged from the marshes of Africa, that we all share the 
    fact of relation to Apes. That we die only to be absorbed by nature, that 
    there are no resurrection, no life after death, no answering to nobody. All 
    we got is our living days on earth; we are perishable like any other 
    elements on earth. That there is no difference between Christians, Muslims, 
    Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists; or any other religions. We all share the same 
    roots of origin, and we all will one day vanish into the same vacuum of 
    nature. Life is a small game of few decades out of billions of year’s 
    evolutionary and recycling process.<br>
    <br>
    There is no justification to fight for religious identity, or association. 
    We all share the same roots to great Apes, and that there will be no 
    different heavens or hells to be punished or praised. We have only one 
    identity, and that is we are all human beings, and we are perishable 
    products of a great game of nature.<br>
    <br>
    This simple understanding of truth could wipe out a whole lot warfare, 
    unnecessary warfare spending, violence, jealousy, and intolerance. And the 
    trillions of dollars spent on religious institutions, practices, and 
    festivities. There will be no terrorism, no fight between Jews and the 
    Muslims, Muslims and Hindus, Tamils and Singhalese. Two hundreds plus states 
    will loose appeal of existence, and slowly will emerge in to a single 
    administrative affair of international proportion. Peace and harmony will 
    take place as religious, racial, national feelings give way to the fact of 
    single roots, single identity, and single destiny.<br>
    <br>
    Understanding and acceptance of the true facts of life will also free man 
    out of many egos, psychological dilemmas as there will be no burden of fear 
    of answering after death, as there will be no prejudice about other people, 
    other races. Simple understanding that we all born once and we all will die 
    once; it’s a single entry and single departure game. This will free us from 
    a whole lot of prejudices; we will all be free for the first time in 
    mankind’s history. Man will start to live with truth, for a common destiny. 
    The age of reason will come into effect. <br>
    <br>
    It should be clearly understood by every one concerned about this writing 
    that I’ve no intention to hurt any one’s feelings, even though a few 
    illogical fanatics ultimately will feel disturbed. What I’m trying is to 
    talk aloud a taboo no one dares to confront. And it is also my democratic 
    right to be able to express freely what I feel is right. If any one doesn’t 
    agree with my views are also entitled to the same rights of freedom of 
    expression and disagreement. <br>
    <br>
    There is no need to feel hurt and angry, just disagree with this view and 
    freely express it. We do live at a time advanced enough to act with in the 
    boundary of reason and logic, leave behind emotions, egos, anger, violence, 
    animal instincts. We’re human beings, far superior in thinking, rationality, 
    reasoning, and understanding. Tomorrows are for reason. I take full 
    responsibility for this writing.) <br>
