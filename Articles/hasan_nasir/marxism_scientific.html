    <p><br>
    Dear Mr. Avijit Roy,<br>
    <br>
    I read your response to Ms. Hashem and felt that you had made certain
    scientifically incorrect claims in your essay. You say that Marxism is
    “unscientific”. I will try to prove to you that it is the only
    scientific basis of social science. But before I begin to do so, let me
    introduce myself briefly. I am with the Communist Workers and Peasants Party
    in Pakistan and we have been using your excellent article on the myth of
    Quranic science to educate people about religious propaganda. Our website is
    at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cmkp_pk" target="_blank" eudora="autourl"><font color="#0000ff"><u>www.geocities.com/cmkp_pk</u></font></a>
    and our yahoogroups is at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cmkp_pk" target="_blank" eudora="autourl"><font color="#0000ff"><u>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/cmkp_pk</u></font></a>.</p>
    <p><br>
    I won’t discuss some points in your original essay which were specific to
    the response to Ms. Hashem but get straight to your scientific inaccuracies.<br>
    First, your entire claim of Marxism being unscientific has ignored a vital
    component of Marxism as a science. Engels claimed in “Socialism Utopian
    and Scientific” that Karl Marx made not one but two scientific
    discoveries. The first was “The Materialist Interpretation of History”
    and the second was “The Theory of Surplus-Value”. Engels says “These
    two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the
    revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value,
    we owe to Marx. With these discoveries, Socialism became a science. The next
    thing was to work out all its details and relations.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm">http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch02.htm</a></u></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000ff"><u><br>
    </u></font>In your entire response, you only dealt with the Theory of
    Surplus-Value, thereby ignoring a crucial aspect of the argument that
    Marxism is a science. Would you care to comment on the scientific validity
    of the materialist interpretation of history? You can read it in the German
    Ideology at:</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/index.htm" target="_blank" eudora="autourl">http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/index.htm</a></u></font></p>
    <p><br>
    Now let us look at your arguments in relation to the Theory of Surplus
    Value. You wrote “The essence of Marxist economics consists of showing
    that worker does not get a return in pay equal to the full 'value' which his
    labor contributes to the product, since part of the profit is retained by
    the capitalist. This had been pointed out by all the great economists.
    Marx's new point was to declare this retention of 'surplus value'
    illegitimate. The novelty was, therefore emotional (ethical) and social
    rather than economic/scientific.”</p>
    <p><br>
    This is completely inaccurate. No economist before Marx had pointed out that
    “the worker does not get a return in pay equal to the full 'value' which
    his labor contributes to the product”. Please quote any economist before
    Marx who had proven this point. It follows that you are entirely incorrect
    in saying that “Marx's new point was to declare this retention of 'surplus
    value' illegitimate.”</p>
    <p><br>
    In fact, in Capital Vol 1 Marx points out that the worker does get the value
    of the product he sells. The exchange-value of the product he is selling is
    approximated in his wage and the product he is selling is labour-power. What
    Marx pointed out was that exploitation was concealed within the “exchange
    of equivalents” (i.e. equivalent values).That the worker gets the worth of
    his commodity (i.e. labour-power). But the crucial discovery was that labour-power
    as a historically specific commodity (which results from “freeing” the
    labourer from the means of production) and determined in accordance with the
    “law of value” is a commodity that in turn produces value (the labour
    theory of value). And the value produced by labour-power is greater than the
    value of labour-power. The difference between the two is surplus-value.</p>
    <p><br>
    This is indeed a profound scientific discovery that you have misrepresented.</p>
    <p><br>
    You continue:<br>
    “…in first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i>, he argues that since profit
    accrues solely from the surplus value extracted from labor, the rate of
    profit will depend upon the proportion of the labor to fixed capital in the
    form of machinery and will therefore tend to fall as technological
    improvements lead to the employment of proportionately less labor.”</p>
    <p><br>
    Just a small correction, actually Marx spoke about the tendency of the rate
    of profit to fall in Capital Volume III. In Capital Volume I he only defines
    the organic composition of capital and looks at its relation to necessary
    and surplus labour-time and therefore necessary and surplus-value. He also
    looks at the rate of exploitation and the rate of profit but he only
    explains the law of declining rate of profit in Capital Vol. III.</p>
    <p><br>
    You continue “This was plainly untrue even at that time, and Marx himself
    finally noted the difficulty but set in aside for later treatment, which he
    never gave it.”</p>
    <p><br>
    I don’t think you have looked at Capital Vol. III. If you just look at the
    Table of Contents you will see that Marx goes into painstaking detail over
    all the “difficulties”. Marx calls these “Counteracting tendencies”
    and looks at them in detail in Part III. These counteracting tendencies are:</p>
    <p><br>
    1. Increasing intensity of exploitation<br>
    2. Depression of wages below the value of labour-power<br>
    3. Cheapening of elements of constant capital<br>
    4. Relative overpopulation<br>
    5. Foreign trade<br>
    6. The increase of stock capital</p>
    <p><br>
    There has been much empirical study on this law and among best works that I
    can think of have been produced by people like Paul Sweezy (Monthly Review).
    Sweezy quite convincingly proves the continuing validity of this law and
    exposes the inaccurate statistical techniques of leading anti-Marxist
    theoreticians who attempt to disprove the tendency of the rate of profit to
    decline.</p>
    <p><br>
    You continue: “Again let's focus on the second 'law' Marx deduced. Marx
    concluded that the number of capitalists would contract, and as a country
    advanced economically under capitalism, it would increasingly polarize the
    into fewer and fewer capitalists and more and more proletarians. This too,
    fails completely as recognizable account of real evolution of the west and
    east Europe.”</p>
    <p><br>
    A more inaccurate statement could not have been made. First, what you are
    attempting to describe is called “The Law of Concentration of Capital”
    and it is statistically easier to verify than the falling rate of profit.
    Here are just a few statistics to prove the growing concentration of capital
    in the world today.</p>
    <p><br>
    · Monopolise of trade: Monopolisation of trade levels out fluctuations and
    creates a more stable rate of profit for the monopoly capitalists. We live
    in a world today where the top 1 percent of all Multinational companies
    account for 70 to 80 percent of global trade (40% of which is merely trade
    between different MNC’s). The top 15 multinational companies control the
    world market in 20 key commodities: 90 per cent of the world’s trade in
    iron ore, wheat, timber, cotton, tobacco, pineapples; 80 per cent of the
    world’s trade in copper, tea, and coffee; 70 per cent of the world’s
    trade in rice; and 60 per cent of the world’s trade in oil. The top 5
    multinational companies account for 70 per cent of consumer durables, 58 per
    cent of cars, trucks, and airlines, 55 per cent of aerospace, 53 per cent of
    electronic components, and 50 per cent of oil, steel, personal computers and
    media industries (Brar, 1997)</p>
    <p><br>
    · Monopolise Production and Investment: The picture that emerges in the
    realm of production and manufacture is not too different from that of world
    trade. A mere 1 percent of all multinational companies own half the total
    stock of foreign direct investment (FDI)<font color="#0000ff"><u>[1]</u></font>,
    80 percent of all international investment, and account for 30 per cent of
    the world’s output.<font color="#0000ff"><u>[2]</u></font> The top 200
    multinational companies employ less than 0.05 per cent of the world’s
    population but control over a quarter of the world’s Gross Domestic
    Product<font color="#0000ff"><u>[3]</u></font> (Brar, 1997).<br>
    Figures of global income and consumption show that the world’s richest 20
    percent control approximately 80 percent of income, trade, lending, saving,
    and investment.<br>

    </u></font>Even bourgeois economist has ever denied that the development of
    capitalism results in the concentration of capital. It has been
    scientifically verified to the extent that it cannot be considered a
    controversial point anymore.
    <p><br>
    You continue: “It is obvious that Marx deduced his famous &quot;<i>law of
    increasing misery</i>&quot; emotionally (hypothetically), not scientifically
    - in which the more the capital invested and the greater the production the
    less will be the wages paid for labor. This has also proven to be false.”</p>
    <p><br>
    Please show me where Marx uses the _expression the “law of increasing
    misery”. This is an _expression from third rate sociology books that
    incorrectly ascribe to Marx the theory of the “iron law of wages”. In
    fact, Marx was a critic of the iron law of wages and the law of increasing
    misery. His own theory bears nothing in common with these views. What he
    asserted was that the relative gap (as opposed to the absolute conditions of
    the proletariat) between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will continue
    to widen. Here is my evidence:<br>
    “Let us suppose the most favorable case: if productive capital grows, the
    demand for labor grows. It therefore increases the price of labor-power,
    wages.</p>
    <p><br>
    A house may be large or small; as long as the neighboring houses are
    likewise small, it satisfies all social requirement for a residence. But let
    there arise next to the little house a palace, and the little house shrinks
    to a hut. The little house now makes it clear that its inmate has no social
    position at all to maintain, or but a very insignificant one; and however
    high it may shoot up in the course of civilization, if the neighboring
    palace rises in equal of even in greater measure, the occupant of the
    relatively little house will always find himself more uncomfortable, more
    dissatisfied, more cramped within his four walls.</p>
    <p><br>
    An appreciable rise in wages presupposes a rapid growth of productive
    capital. Rapid growth of productive capital calls forth just as rapid a
    growth of wealth, of luxury, of social needs and social pleasures.
    Therefore, although the pleasures of the laborer have increased, the social
    gratification which they afford has fallen in comparison with the increased
    pleasures of the capitalist, which are inaccessible to the worker, in
    comparison with the stage of development of society in general. Our wants
    and pleasures have their origin in society; we therefore measure them in
    relation to society; we do not measure them in relation to the objects which
    serve for their gratification. Since they are of a social nature, they are
    of a relative nature.”</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#0000ff"><u>http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch06.htm</u></font></p>
    <p><br>
    Thus, it is crystal clear from this passage that Marx is talking about the
    relative poverty of the working class. After an elaborate discussion about
    the relationship between capital and labour-power Marx concludes:</p>
    <p><br>
    “We have thus seen that even the most favorable situation for the working
    class, namely, the most rapid growth of capital, however much it may improve
    the material life of the worker, does not abolish the antagonism between his
    interests and the interests of the capitalist. Profit and wages remain as
    before, in inverse proportion.<br>
    If capital grows rapidly, wages may rise, but the profit of capital rises
    disproportionately faster. The material position of the worker has improved,
    but at the cost of his social position. The social chasm that separates him
    from the capitalist has widened.”</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#0000ff"><u>http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch08.htm</u></font></p>
    <p><br>
    Thus, as you can clearly see from this passage Marx is concerned about the
    “social chasm” and not the absolute standard of living of the worker.
    Thus, capitalism will not perish owing to a moral imperative, or owing to an
    economic crisis, but owing to the increasing social antagonism between the
    interests of capital and the interests of labour.<br>
    Avijit continues: “He thought Capitalism is bound to collapse, not because
    it was undesirable but because the 'iron laws' of economic development
    proved that it was already - over century ago - a brake on the productive
    forces, so that under it the economy would be unable to expand. But facts
    proved other wise despite Marx thought it right. And his basic failure has
    naturally involved those Shetara Hasems who still call themselves Marxists
    in a cycle of errors.”</p>
    <p><br>
    Show me the passage from Marx that states that there would come a point in
    capitalism when the rate of growth would become zero. What Marx said was
    that capitalism has become a brake on the further development of the
    productive forces in relation to more advanced relations of production (i.e.
    socialism). Even Feudalism did not stop developing the economy at the point
    that it was overthrown by capitalism. It was just that in relation to
    capitalism it was a brake on the further development of the productive
    forces, just as capitalism today has become a break on the further
    development of productive forces in relation to socialism.</p>
    <p><br>
    Avijit Roy concludes from the various disagreements among Marxists that
    Marxism is not a science. What he neglects is that the in order to prove
    that Marxism is a science it is not necessary for communists to agree on
    everything. It is only necessary for them to agree on two things: The
    Materialist Interpretation of History, the Theory of Surplus-Value. All the
    tendencies within the Marxist movement that you have pointed out uphold
    these basic scientific discoveries of Karl Marx. Therefore, their
    disagreements are over the best course of action in the creation of a
    socialist society and not over the fundamental scientific basis of Marxism.</p>
    <p><br>
    Mr Avijit says “…calling Marxism is scientific, leads us to bizarre
    extreme, because not all the leading Economists view it as scientific, not
    all prominent philosopher accepts this philosophy as scientific.”</p>
    <p><br>
    There was a time when not all the leading scientists of the world accepted
    that the world was not flat. That didn’t change the fact that the flat
    Earth theory was utterly incorrect. There was a time when scientists were
    burnt at the stake, it did not change the laws of motion of celestial
    bodies. In the Muslim world today most people think that God exists. Does
    that mean it is scientifically correct? Obviously not. What matters is to
    what extent does an independent scientific examination reveal the validity
    of Marxism in relation to the objective world. (Bertrand Russell who was
    opposed to the liberation of the African colonies and was a known
    aristocratic racist—aside from also being a great mathematician and
    writer—was not beyond his own class prejudices). But certainly anyone who
    has read Marx in relation to Bertrand Russell cannot help but feel the
    infinite superiority of Marx as an intellectual.<br>
    You write “Again, leading Marxist and Communist leaders had mostly been of
    bourgeois origin. Marx here admits that their motivations are not those
    normally provided for by Marxism. But what is it that determines that some
    bourgeois intellectuals should become Marxists while others do not? Shetara
    Hasem might want to come with a scientific explanation, perhaps?”</p>
    <p><br>
    Please quote where Marx says that the “motivations” of the bourgeois
    intellectuals who become Marxists are not “provided for by Marxism”? In
    fact, Marx talks about the development of the revolutionary intelligentsia
    in many of his works. To start with here is a quote from the Communist
    Manifesto:</p>
    <p><br>
    “Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the
    progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the
    whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that
    a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the
    revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as,
    therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the
    bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the
    proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who
    have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the
    historical movement as a whole.”</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#0000ff"><u>http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm</u></font></p>
    <p><br>
    You wrote: “In fact, Marx's idea of a society which would ensure for
    everyone fair shares of the goods produced has not a &quot;new&quot; one,
    and had long been a unfulfilled dream in human insight. In some country,
    particularly Britain, has produced a large socialist party without much
    reference to special doctrine of Marx. Even, Dialectic Materialism, for
    which Marx will be remembered, is not his own creation. Ancient Greek
    Philosopher, Hiraclitas preached the same philosophy long time ago. Marx
    describes his system as arising from three sources - the philosophy of
    German Hegel, the economics of Richardo, ando other British economists, and
    the social theories of French Socialists like Saint-Simon.”</p>
    <p><br>
    Is it so hard to understand that Marx made a scientific contribution
    distinct from Hiraclitas or the utopian socialists? His scientific discovery
    was not Dialectics. It was not even socialism. It was the foundation of
    socialism on a scientific footing by discovering two things 1) the
    Materialist interpretation of history 2) the Theory of Surplus-Value. Find
    me one person in history that elaborated these ideas as complete theories.
    Bits and pieces of insight do not prove that these discoveries were made
    before Marx.</p>
    <p><br>
    Mr. Avijit goes onto the favorite hobbyhorse of the bourgeoisie: The
    atrocities of Stalin.<br>
    First, one should read “Another View of Stalin” by Ludo Martins to clear
    ones mind of all the bourgeois propaganda against Stalin. <a href="http://www.plp.org/books/Stalin/book.html" target="_blank" eudora="autourl"><font color="#0000ff"><u>http://www.plp.org/books/Stalin/book.html</u></font></a>.<br>
    Second, even if you proved that Stalin committed atrocities, how does that
    disprove the materialist interpretation of history or the theory of
    surplus-value? From a strictly scientific point of view one has to disprove
    these theories do not accord to the objective world. If X made a mistake on
    Y occasion it has no bearing on whether A corresponds to B. Stalin’s real
    or alleged atrocities have no impact on the scientific validity of
    materialism or the theory of surplus-value. The fact is that you just
    couldn’t help taking the support of popular prejudice created from years
    of US propaganda to attempt to win your argument (i.e. proving that Marxism
    is not a science).</p>
    <p><br>
    There is no need for me to answer all the slanderous accusations you have
    hurled against the communist leadership or the Soviet Union. Because
    frankly, none of this has any impact on the real debate that is going on: Is
    Marxism a science.<br>
    Last you assert that, “In my view, attraction of Marxist views among his
    followers is not because it is scientific but for the belief that western
    capitalist society is either inherently evil, or at least incapable of
    satisfying human needs.”</p>
    <p><br>
    You are ascribing motives to people purely subjectively. I can tell you that
    I was attracted to Marxism because it is the most scientific explanation of
    history and critique of capitalism that I have read to date.</p>
    <p><br>
    I hope that clarifies some misconceptions and inaccurate statements that you
    were ascribing to Marxism. I do not check this website regularly, therefore,
    if you write a response please notify me.</p>
