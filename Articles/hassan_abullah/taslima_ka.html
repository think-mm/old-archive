					Nasrin’s Ka: A Cry Against a Book</b></font> </p>
					<p align="center">&nbsp;<b><font face="Verdana" color="#000080">HassanAl Abdullah</font></b> </p>
					<p align="center">
  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on
	July 31, 2005</font></b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The third volume of 
					her autobiography has also been banned in Bangladesh, as it 
					happened to the first and the second volumes. This time the 
					court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, the well-known 
					literary figure Syed Shamsul Huq. He filed a lawsuit of five 
					hundred thousand dollars against Taslima Nasrin since she 
					wrote an episode in which Mr. Huq was involved. Though I 
					believe, this volume, Ka, would have eventually been banned 
					by the present government as the other two volumes, since 
					Ms. Nasrin criticized both the Islamic fundamentalist and 
					Islam itself, but Mr. Huq served an important roll for the 
					government. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only Mr. Huq, 
					but many other poets and writers from Bangladesh and India 
					have also been criticizing the book. They are upset because 
					Ms. Nasrin widely explored on her private life where some of 
					the writers were involved in it. A poet, novelist and the 
					Professor of the Bangla Department at Dhaka University, Dr. 
					Humaun Azad said, &quot;I did not read the book. I heard Taslima 
					criticized me a lot, but she could not include me in her sex 
					life, since I never responded her.&quot; Dikondito (Bisected), 
					the Indian edition of the book, has also been banned and 
					seized by the police from bookshops in West Bengal, since 
					another lawsuit was filed there by a young poet with whom 
					Taslima mentioned to have sexual relationship. One of the 
					writers, Shamoresh Mojumder, even called her &quot;a whore&quot; in a 
					newspaper interview and compared her with a prostitute, 
					Nandibala, of Sonagachhi. Sunil Gangopadhay, poet and 
					novelist who visits the US at least twice a year, said, &quot;The 
					book would upset Muslim people here.&quot; About his previous 
					relation with Taslima, he assured his readers by saying, &quot;I 
					am not afraid of Taslima, because I had no sexual relation 
					with her.&quot; It reminds me of President Clinton’s statement 
					about Monica though I still believe that it was not a big 
					deal. Any way, the feminist writer Taslima again became a 
					hot issue in Bengal. Newspapers and magazines are publishing 
					commentaries about the book; people are talking about it in 
					the street corners and in the tea parties, and the Bengali 
					tabloids from New York City are reprinting various chapters 
					of the book without asking permission either from the writer 
					or from the publisher. Some are commenting on it without 
					even reading what Taslima actually wrote in the book, some 
					are commenting on it by grabbing the knowledge from the 
					tabloids, and a few who have read the book are saying that 
					it’s well written. Such a shopkeeper in Astoria told me that 
					he read the book in three consecutive nights and he liked 
					it. He also talked about an episode how a young man burned 
					his cigarette on Taslima’s hand and how she kept silent 
					thinking that the society would blame her instead for being 
					involved with a man. While talking with the shopkeeper, a 
					gentleman who was enjoying our conversation, asked me, 
					&quot;Since you are a writer too, tell me how much of her sex 
					life she expresses is true.&quot; I replied, &quot;It is her life and 
					she wrote about it. I believe all of it is true.&quot; The 
					questioner got a little upset, &quot;So you believe all the 
					writers are like this!&quot; &quot;Like what?&quot; I said. &quot;They seek for 
					women’s beauty whenever they get a chance!&quot; &quot;Well, it 
					depends on the writer. But she did not mention all the 
					writers of the country. She only mentioned the ones she was 
					aquatinted with. Moreover, I believe she did not dishonor 
					anyone, not even Mr. Huq. She actually disappointed the 
					fundamentalists which Mr. Huq, Dr. Azad and Mr. Gangopadhay 
					ignored, though, I know, all three of them are fighting 
					against fundamentalism.&quot; The man was not happy with the 
					answer and the shopkeeper asked me to stop the conversation 
					and leave the store, since more of his customers were 
					getting interested on the topic. While all of this is 
					happening I could see the Muslim fundamentalists of 
					Bangladesh who once offered 50,000 taka for her head and the 
					Hindu fundamentalists of India, who used one of her books, 
					Lajja (Shame) during the election campaign, are the ones 
					being happy. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In her book, Ka, 
					Taslima Nasrin showed how a freedom-seeking-woman, even 
					educated like her, would struggle in every step of her life. 
					Not only her own, she also mapped out the sufferings of all 
					the women as a whole, and dug her pen into the root of 
					problems. As a physician in Bangladesh, she experienced how 
					the poor women of the villages were brought to the hospital 
					for ligation for only a sari and a 100 taka (less than 2 
					dollars), even though many of them did not want to do it at 
					the young age. She says, only the very old men of the 
					society, who don’t even need it, come for vasectomy. Since 
					women have no say in any part of their lives, they do 
					whatever the men want. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the mid-eighties, 
					while I was a student of the University of Dhaka, I first 
					read Taslima’s work in a weekly magazine, Khaborer Kagoj, 
					which I used to subscribe. I immediately noticed that she 
					was exploring the horrible lives of many women of the 
					country. She did not forget to criticize the religion for 
					the fact that it gave women a very marginal role in the 
					society. Islam says, &quot;A woman’s heaven is beneath her 
					husband’s feet.&quot; Even if her husband tortures her, she would 
					have no right to say anything. &quot;If you are busy cooking in 
					the kitchen, and your husband wants to have sex, you must 
					respond to fulfill his wish.&quot; This is also the part of the 
					religious teaching. Well, when this is the ‘rule,’ the 
					country provides a sister one half of what a brother would 
					get of the parental property. Moreover, women are widely 
					discouraged to go to school. It is widely understood that 
					they are born to cook and bear children. Also, a man can 
					marry up to four women, but a woman does not even have the 
					right to choose her own husband. The family would decide her 
					marital fate. While this was the case, Ms. Nasrin’s writing 
					was getting a lot of attention. People wanted to stop her 
					voice. Many tabloids started making stories about her 
					private life. She married three times and got divorced 
					because, as she wrote in the book, those men wanted to 
					control her. She wanted to do things on her own, but none of 
					them allowed her to do so. She says even her father, who was 
					also a physician, did not like her doing things on her own. 
					After she got divorced from her first husband, a poet and an 
					addict, she married the editor of the weekly Khoborer Kagoj. 
					But soon after their wedding, the editor did not show much 
					interest in publishing her work. He started giving her 
					advice on what to write and what not to write. He even 
					started to control her movement, which Taslima did not like. 
					So one day she went to the court and ended her second 
					marriage. She asked her publisher to look for an apartment. 
					But no homeowner wanted to rent out the apartments to a 
					single woman, as women must live with men. Finally she got 
					an apartment promising that she would stay with her mother. 
					She was working in a hospital nearby. Her father lived in 
					her city of birth, Maymonshingh. One evening while her 
					mother was away in Maymonshingh, her father came to her 
					apartment with her older brother. She was surprised on their 
					surprising visit. They surprised her even more; they neither 
					ate diner nor went to sleep. They spent the whole night 
					sitting in chairs. She did not know what was the matter with 
					them. In the morning when she was about to go to work, her 
					father stopped her and said, &quot;You have to go with us. You 
					don’t have to go to hospital.&quot; She said, &quot;But patients would 
					be waiting for me. I have to go to work.&quot; Her father 
					immediately pushed her down to the floor and kicked her in 
					the stomach. She was stunned on the situation. While she 
					managed to stand up, she got another push and a kick in the 
					back. She fell on the refrigerator and cut her lips. Her 
					brother, who was standing by, threw a tabloid on her face. 
					&quot;Look, what they wrote about you! This is what you do here!&quot; 
					yelled her father. This was a fundamentalist paper. Since 
					she was criticizing them, they finally wanted to illuminate 
					her private life to the public with exaggerations. Her 
					father read it and got upset. It obviously hurt his prestige 
					too. So he immediately came to rescue it. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She was forced to go 
					the Maymonshingh and was locked in a room, where she was 
					given food and a portable commode to respond to the natural 
					call. One morning while her mother brought breakfast in, 
					there was a sudden noise in the kitchen. She ran back to the 
					kitchen, thinking of something bad done by the housemaid. 
					Since she was rushing she forgot to lock the room. So, 
					Taslima got a chance. She ran, ran and ran out of the house. 
					She took a detour to get to the Dhaka City, so that when her 
					father would know that she fled, he would not be able to 
					catch her. The local bus took almost 10 hours to get to 
					Dhaka instead of usual 4 hours. At 11 in the night, standing 
					in the bus station, she did not know what to do and where to 
					go. Her father gave up the apartment she rented, and her 
					furniture was taken to Maymonshingh. So, she even did not 
					have a place to sleep. Luckily she remembered the phone 
					number of a friend, who was also the editor of a weekly 
					magazine. She told her situation and asked if she could stay 
					with his family for the night. The guy gave her a ride home 
					and a bed in their living room to sleep, where she stayed a 
					couple of days. She got her job back and married the guy. 
					She did not actually wanted to marry the man, as she 
					mentioned, but she had no where to stay and the editor said 
					if she had to stay in his house she had to marry him. He 
					mentioned that he was under pressure from the family. Once 
					she got married she started to know the editor a little 
					better. He was coming home late and drunk, started to beat 
					her up, pushed her out of the door and locked it from 
					inside. She spent many nights with the landlord’s wife. On 
					one night, while thrown out of the apartment and staying 
					with the landlady, Taslima thought it was enough. She 
					decided not to stay with a man anymore, no matter how much 
					the society would blame her. She said to the landlady, &quot;If 
					you could get them out of the house I would rent it for me 
					instead.&quot; She moved to a hotel for the time being. Since she 
					had already made a soft side with the landlady, the landlady 
					managed his husband to get the editor and his family out of 
					the apartment, and Taslima rented it. Besides her life, in 
					this biographical novel, she discussed about the women’s 
					problems in the society, the political unrest and the 
					religious suppression. The socioeconomic situation and the 
					uprising of the Muslim fundamentalism were also been 
					illustrated. She wrote, &quot;Religion is such a destroyer, even 
					if you don’t believe in it, you are bounded by it…. It is 
					almost like a kind of cancer that has no medicine.&quot; </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At times, the 
					government seized her passport and asked her to get the 
					government’s approval if she had to publish anything. She 
					said she never heard of that kind of rule before. The 
					authority replied that every government employee had to go 
					through the censorship. So she quit the Hospital job and 
					became a full time writer. But very soon, the Mullahs 
					declared 50,000 taka for her head. They accused her of 
					writing against Muhammad and Koran. The government first 
					overlooked the Mullahs demand and refused to give her any 
					security. There were rallies against her in every city 
					demanding her death sentence. They called her a murdat 
					--apostate. She was continuously being threatened for live 
					over the phone. She wrote, &quot;I was staying at home holding my 
					life in hand.&quot; Well, she was right. One day, there was a 
					knock at her door. A couple of guys were knocking and 
					kicking at the door and shouting to open it. She wrote, &quot;My 
					young housemaid and I went to the writing room and hid. I 
					felt death was walking towards me. I imagined they broke the 
					main door and come to me with a long sword. Two of them held 
					my hands and the other two my legs. One held my head a 
					little aside while another, with the sword, slicing it off 
					my body to give it to the Mullahs for 50,000 taka to save 
					Islam. Sweat dropped down from my whole body. I felt sleepy. 
					Yes, I did fall in asleep. When I woke up I saw they were 
					gone.&quot; After the incident, she went to the court for 
					security. The judge said, &quot;Why won’t they ask for your head 
					if you write against Islam?&quot; But the judge ordered two 
					police met in front of her apartment. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The story went on. 
					The Mullahs numbered her days. Each day passed, she thought 
					it was an extension for her. The International Writers 
					Groups, PEN, and the Amnesty International kept on 
					pressuring the government for her safety. Finally, her 
					passport was given back to her and she was thrown out to 
					Europe in 1994. She is now living in the United States, 
					where she is doing a fellowship at Harvard on the 
					possibility of secularism in the Islamic countries. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The book is 
					heartbreaking, horrifying, disputable, and extremely moving. 
					It shows if an educated woman like her had to go through so 
					much problems for independence and writing about woman, then 
					how the sufferings of the general villagers, ninety percent 
					of whom are illiterate, would actually be. The writer did 
					not fear to criticize the government, the Mullahs, the 
					political situation, the rajakers—the collaborators of 1971 
					who are now in power. She also wrote about the good and bad 
					sides of the well-known writers of Bangladesh and West 
					Bengal. But I did not experience any literary dishonesty. 
					Taslima illustrated the darkness of the society. Probably, 
					this is why the book was banned in both Bangladesh and 
					India. It’s a shame. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The banning of the 
					book made some Bengali booksellers happy here in the New 
					York City. They are selling Ka for 20 dollars, which is only 
					a four dollars in Bangladesh. One of the storekeepers from 
					Jackson Heights happily mentioned that he would sell about 
					500 copies. He imported the Indian edition. &quot;I was lucky. If 
					the shipment from India was delayed for only a day, I would 
					not be able to get the book,&quot; he added. I asked, &quot;How much 
					are you selling it for? Twenty?&quot; He protested, &quot;No, No. It’s 
					the Indian edition. It’s for twenty-five.&quot; He was smiling, 
					though he used a slang against Ms. Nasrin’s character a few 
					minutes earlier. He sold thirty copies in two days. 2003</font></p>
