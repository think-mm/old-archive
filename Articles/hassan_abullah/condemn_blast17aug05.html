					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Are not you going 
					to Bangladesh this summer?&quot; A BNP--Bangladesh Nationalist 
					Party, supporter asked me, while I was waiting for a friend 
					of mine in Jackson Heights. The BNP supporter was also 
					there, hanging around with some friends. We knew each other, 
					and so after exchanging the greetings he asked me the 
					question. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No. Not this year. 
					I went there last summer. Probably, I will go there again in 
					the next summer.&quot; I replied. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;O no, no. You 
					should go there now and see how peaceful the country is! The 
					present government made it a heaven. You will enjoy it now.&quot; 
					He insisted. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I see! After such 
					an advertisement from you, I believe I should go there. But, 
					for some internal problems I cannot keep your request.&quot; I 
					politely supported my position. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It's not an 
					advertisement, it is real. The country is a heaven now. You 
					people always talk against the country. But I was born in 
					there. Bangladesh is my mother land.&quot; He got excited. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Don't forget that I 
					was born in there too. And I watch TV regularly, I read 
					Papers. The real situation is very different from what you 
					are suggesting. And I am not talking against the country. I, 
					too, want the country to be peaceful so that I could go 
					there with my family to spend my summer vacations.&quot; I 
					explained. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I read your work, I 
					understand what you wanted to say. The country was much 
					worse in the Awami League period which you can't see.&quot; He 
					got so excited that it was almost impossible to continue 
					with him. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;But I am not even 
					mentioning any party. I am interested in the real situation 
					of the country.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The present 
					government made it a heaven. Try to see it in your own eye 
					and write about that. Try to write as Nazrul did, don't 
					follow the Tagorean way.&quot; He suggested. But he understood 
					neither of the poets, I thought. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At this point my 
					friend, for whom I was waiting, arrived. I shook the BNP 
					supporter's hand and departed. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a few hours 
					later, I got the news of the series of bombing throughout 
					the country. More than 350 hand made bombs were blasted from 
					10:30 am to 11:30 am on Wednesday. After getting the news 
					from CNN and Reuters I made a several phone calls to my 
					relatives in different parts of the country. I heard the 
					persistent fear in their voices over the phone. No one had 
					any idea what was really going on. A bomb was blasted right 
					in front of the 20-bed clinic of my uncle, Dr. Nasir, in 
					Gopalgonj. He resides in the second floor while the first 
					floor of the same building is used as a clinic. &quot;I am lucky 
					that I got out of home a few minutes earlier than the 
					blast,&quot; said his wife. She was sill panicking. I know that 
					not only my relatives, but every citizen of the country is 
					now in a deep shock. They are panicking because they don't 
					know what is coming up next. Bombs have been blasted, people 
					have been killed, and secular poets and writers have been 
					tortured for years. But the culprits are not being brought 
					to justice. The government is always in a state of denial. 
					But, we, the secular people--living in the country or 
					outside, could see that there has been a serious problem 
					going on within this small nation of the World. The Muslim 
					fundamentalists have already captured the whole nation and 
					they are working in favor of the government. Otherwise this 
					type of bombing throughout the whole country is not 
					possible. Probably, the government still have a little time 
					to realize that the country is going to a wrong direction. 
					The government might make it a heaven, that would not be for 
					the general people, but for the fundamentalists. We do not 
					want that. So, on behalf of the international poetry 
					journal, Shabdaguchha, I condemn the bomb blasts. </font>
