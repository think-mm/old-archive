					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well, the name of 
					the cartoonist is Arifur Rahman(20) and the title of his 
					cartoon is Name. In the cartoon he wrote: </font></p>
					<p align="justify"></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--What's your name? 
					[Asked the illiterate Mullah] </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--My name is Babu.

					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--Mohammed Kitty. 
					[Answered the boy] </font></p>
					<p align="justify"></p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cartoon was 
					published in the Daily Prothom Alo in its supplement, 
					Alpine, on September 17, 2007. After seeing it and knowing 
					about the protests against it, I wanted to measure the 
					seriousness of the cartoon by a person who did not know the 
					story. So, I've presented the story to my mother, who is a 
					very religious person, and who is fasting in this month of 
					Ramadan. Hearing the story from me, she burst out in 
					laughter. I, too, would laugh like her if the Bangladeshi 
					Mullahs would not find this cartoon religiously offensive 
					and would not say that it was an insult to their prophet 
					Mohammed. Moreover, the law advisor (Ministry of Law) of the 
					present caretaker government said that the publishing of the 
					cartoon was a conspiracy against the country's stability 
					while a group of Mullahs went to him demanding the immediate 
					arrest of the cartoonist, the editor and the publisher of 
					the Daily. The government banned this particular issue and 
					the further publication of the magazine, Alpine. 
					Surprisingly, the Daily Prothom Alo took similar steps by 
					firing, Sumonto Aslam, the journalist who was in charge of 
					the magazine, and sending an open letter to the public 
					saying that it was a great mistake to publish that offensive 
					cartoon and they would never publish any more contribution 
					from the cartoonist, and they would also make sure nothing 
					that denounce the religious sentiment would ever be 
					published in their Paper again. So, the cartoonist, Arifur 
					Rahman, was arrested and the next day he was sent in jail by 
					the honorable judge. There was no lawyer for the cartoonist 
					to defend his freedom of thinking. On the other hand, 
					thousands of Mullahs are protesting in the streets against 
					the Daily and asking the government to cancel its license, 
					so that the Mullahs can keep their ignorant activities 
					freely alive. </font></p>

					<p align="center"><b><font size="5" face="Verdana">2. </font>
					</b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Neither the Mullah 
					nor the boy in the cartoon looks like an Arab. So, how would 
					that be an insult to their prophet? Many of the Islamists 
					would say, well, the usage of the name Mohammed is an 
					insult. But, how many Mohammeds are there in the world now? 
					Probably about a billion or so. And how many of them are 
					thieves, hijackers, murderers, and hypocrites? (Here I am 
					not talking about the Mohammeds who are engineers, doctors, 
					poets, writers and good people like me(!)--since I am also a 
					Mohammed named by another Mullah some 40 years ago--for the 
					sake of the argument.) Are not these people then an insult 
					to the prophet Mohammed, since they are all using his name? 
					Why do the Mullahs then push everybody born in a Muslim 
					culture to have the first name, Mohammed? Probably, now is 
					the time to rethink about the tradition. At least, the 
					20-year-old cartoonist pointed it out through his cartoon 
					characters, by criticizing not the real Mohammed but the 
					ignorant Mullahs of our society. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"></p>
					<p align="center"><b><font size="5" face="Verdana">3. </font>
					</b></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was not only 
					surprised by the government's response to the issue, but the 
					decision by the Daily Prothom Alo to not to defend even the 
					cartoonist and firing the Alpine editor immediately made me 
					think deeply about what's going on in the poorest country of 
					the world, Bangladesh. I know, the fundamentalists would 
					find anything, even a laughable matter like this, to make an 
					issue for their own political gain. But, what happened to 
					our so called intellectuals and 'freethinkers' who are 
					running Papers like the Prothom Alo? I strongly condemn 
					their cowardice decisions. And I urge the fundamentalist and 
					the military backed government, please open your eyes before 
					you even pronounce that you are blind. I also demand the 
					immediate release of the innocent cartoonist, who can think 
					better than many lawmakers and politicians of the country. I 
					am worried because I don't want to see Bangladesh turning 
					into another Afghanistan which the Muslim fundamentalists 
					are trying to do for a long time. When I see that the editor 
					of the Daily, Motiur Rahman, goes to the Mosque to beg 
					pardon from the Mullahs, I do not understand who the people 
					are actually running the country, the Mullahs or the 
					Government. How many steps are there to make Bangladesh a 
					new Afghanistan ? </font></p>
