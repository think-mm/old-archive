		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the results of the Cosmic 
		Microwave Background Explorer (COBE) satellite first became public in 
		1992, mission scientist George Smoot remarked, &quot;If you're religious, 
		it's like looking at God.&quot; The media loved it. One tabloid front page 
		showed the face of Jesus (as interpreted by medieval artists, of course) 
		outlined on a blurry picture of the cosmos. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reporting on the conference 
		&quot;Science and the Spiritual Quest&quot; held at the Center for Theology and 
		Science in Berkeley this summer, the July 20 cover of
		<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/"><cite>Newsweek</cite></a> announced: 
		&quot;Science Finds God.&quot; The several hundred scientists and theologians at 
		the meeting were virtually unanimous in agreeing that science and 
		religion are now converging, and what they are converging on is God. 
		South African cosmologist and Quaker George Ellis expressed the 
		consensus: &quot;There is a huge amount of data supporting the existence of 
		God. The question is how to evaluate it.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <cite>Newsweek</cite> story 
		noted that, &quot;The achievements of modern science seem to contradict 
		religion and undermine faith.&quot; However, &quot;for a growing number of 
		scientists, the same discoveries offer support for spirituality and 
		hints at the very nature of God.&quot; We learn that, &quot;Physicists have 
		stumbled on signs that the cosmos is custom-made for life and 
		consciousness.&quot; Big-bang cosmology, quantum mechanics, and chaos theory 
		all are interpreted as &quot;opening a door for God to act on the world.&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Surveys, however, do not confirm 
		the contention that &quot;a growing number of scientists&quot; are finding support 
		for spirituality in their scientific studies. A recent poll of U.S.
		<a href="http://www.nas.edu/">National Academy of Science</a> members 
		indicated only 7% believe in a personal creator, down from 15% in 1933 
		and 29% in 1914. If anything, most scientists seem to be moving away 
		from spirituality rather than toward it. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Apparently, what we are hearing 
		is not the voice of a growing majority of scientists, but the 
		well-funded, growing voice of a decreasing minority. The Berkeley 
		meeting was a kind of &quot;Premise-Keepers&quot; rally for academics seeking to 
		keep alive their premise that God exists, while science continues to 
		operate successfully with no need for that premise. </font></p>
		<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Stepping Over the Line </font>
		</h2>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a commentary on the Berkeley 
		meeting, George Johnson of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><cite>
		New York Times</cite></a> noted that &quot;religious believers seem more 
		eager than ever to step over the line, trying to interpret scientific 
		data to support the revealed truths of their own theology.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To most theistic believers, 
		human life has no meaning in a universe without God. Quite sincerely and 
		with understandable yearning for a purpose to existence, they reject 
		that possibility. Thus only a created universe is possible, and the data 
		can do nothing else but support this &quot;truth.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, good science practice 
		demands that everything be open to question, including the premises that 
		are used when interpreting data. While some assumptions are always 
		present in the scientific process, all are subject to change as more 
		powerful and economical assumptions become evident. The Premise-Keepers, 
		pure as their motives may be, practice bad science when they confine 
		their interpretation of scientific observations to a designer universe.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To the Premise-Keeper, the big 
		bang provides &quot;evidence&quot; that creation took place in time - just as in 
		the biblical (that is, Babylonian) myth. Something cannot come from 
		nothing, and so the universe needs a creator. That the creator must have 
		come from nothing is finessed away. God is a different &quot;logical type&quot; 
		than the universe - a type that does not require creation. Theologians 
		do not make clear why the universe itself cannot be of this logical 
		type. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Premise-Keepers recognize 
		that they cannot prove the existence of God. They simply express the 
		strong feeling that intelligent design is demonstrated by the very order 
		of the universe. Unfortunately, science has little sympathy for feelings 
		and desires no matter how sincere their intent. The universe is the way 
		it is, regardless of what anyone might want it to be. If humanity is in 
		fact a grain of sand in an infinite Sahara, as our telescopes 
		increasingly indicate, then we cannot wish it otherwise. We should 
		accept the fact and learn to live with it. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nonbelievers recognize that they 
		cannot prove the nonexistence of God. They simply argue that a universe 
		without a creator is the most economical premise consistent with all the 
		data. An uncaused, undesigned emergence of the universe from nothing 
		violates no principle of physics. The total energy of the universe 
		appears to be zero, so no miracle of energy created &quot;from nothing&quot; was 
		required to produce it. Similarly, no miracle was needed for the 
		appearance of order. Order can and does occur spontaneously in physical 
		systems. </font></p>
		<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Universe Fine-Tuned for Life
		</font></h2>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In recent years, the notion that 
		the laws of physics are &quot;fine-tuned&quot; for the existence of life has 
		caught the fancy of believing scientists and theologians alike. Indeed, 
		probably no idea has received more attention in the latest discussions 
		on religion and science. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fine-tuning argument rests 
		on a series of scientific facts called the &quot;anthropic coincidences.&quot; 
		Basically, they say that if the universe had appeared with slight 
		variations in the values of its fundamental constants, that universe 
		would not have produced the elements, such as carbon and oxygen, and 
		other conditions necessary for life. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fine-tuning argument assumes 
		only one form of life is possible. But many different forms of life 
		might still be possible with different laws and constants of physics. 
		The main requirement seems to be that stars live long enough to produce 
		the elements needed for life and allow time for the complex, nonlinear 
		systems we call life to evolve. I have made some calculations in which I 
		randomly vary the values of the physical constants by many orders of 
		magnitude and look at the universes that would exist under those 
		circumstances. I find that almost all combinations lead to universes, 
		albeit some strange ones, with stars that live a billion years or more. 
		Life of some kind would be likely in most of these possible universes.
		</font></p>
		<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The God of the Equations </font>
		</h2>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A second, related line of 
		argument is found in the recent dialogues. The equations of mathematics 
		and physics are claimed to provide evidence for a Platonic order to the 
		universe that transcends the universe of our observations. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recent trends in Christian 
		theology and its rapprochement with science have moved Christianity 
		closer to a position where a deity is to be found in the order of nature 
		as a creative entity transcending space, time, and matter responsible 
		for that order. Indeed, the modern Western theological notion of God is 
		probably closer to Plato's Form of the Good than the white-bearded 
		Jehovah/Zeus on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or the beardless 
		Jesus/Apollo on the wall. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And here is where some 
		scientists and theologians currently seem to find a common ground - in 
		the idea that ultimate reality is not to be found in the quarks, atoms, 
		rocks, trees, planets, and stars of experience and observation. Rather, 
		reality exists in the mathematical perfection of the symbols and 
		equations of physics. The deity then coexists with these equations in 
		some realm or mathematical perfection beyond human observation. This God 
		is knowable, not by his or her physical appearance before us but by its 
		presence as that Platonic reality. We all exist in the &quot;mind of God.&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Past logical disputes over the 
		existence of God were largely confined to philosophers and theologians. 
		This type of purely logical discourse, in which little reference is made 
		to observations, is largely disdained by scientists - believers and 
		nonbelievers alike. Premise-Keeper scientists claim they are going 
		beyond the traditional theological arguments, that they see direct 
		evidence for intelligent design in their observations and equations.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Paul Davies has put it: &quot;The 
		very fact that the universe is creative, and that the laws have 
		permitted complex structures to emerge and develop to the point of 
		consciousness - in other words, that the universe has organized its own 
		self-awareness - is for me powerful evidence that there is `something 
		going on' behind it all. The impression of design is overwhelming.&quot; Note 
		the use of &quot;evidence&quot; rather than &quot;proof&quot; in this quotation. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Still, a Platonic God need not 
		have anything to do with the God of the Bible, nor any other imagined 
		deity, abstract or personal. And the equations need not actually 
		represent a transcendent deity. True that Platonist physicists view 
		quantum fields and spacetime metric tensors as &quot;more real&quot; than quarks 
		and electrons. Materialist physicists, by contrast, think that quarks 
		and electrons are more real than metric tensors or fields of any kind, 
		these simply being human inventions. But the majority from both camps do 
		not view either of these possible realities as deities. They do not see 
		that a &quot;miracle&quot; was necessary for the universe and life to exist.
		</font></p>
		<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Still Seeking the God of the 
		Gaps </font></h2>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This illustrates why the claimed 
		convergence of science and religion does not hold up under scrutiny. 
		Look at history. Science has always explained observations in terms of 
		natural (that is, nonsupernatural) phenomena. Religion has always 
		proposed supernatural explanations to fill those gaps where science 
		provided no natural explanations, or simply remained silent. Only one 
		domain of existence has ever been occupied in either case - the domain 
		of human observations. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The shamans in ancient forests 
		taught that &quot;spirits&quot; caused rocks to roll down a hill - until Newton 
		said it was gravity. Priests taught that &quot;God&quot; created humans in his own 
		image, until Darwin said evolution created us in the image of apes. And 
		now we have this new breed of scientist-theologian arguing yet again 
		that just because science cannot explain this, that, or the other thing, 
		then we still have room for God. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We cannot explain why the 
		constants of nature have the curious values they have, so maybe God made 
		them so. We cannot explain the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of 
		mathematics,&quot; so maybe God invented mathematics. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Maybe. But is this modern God of 
		the gaps any more plausible than the God of the shamans and priests? 
		Maybe one day science will fill in these gaps without the premise of 
		God. </font></p>
