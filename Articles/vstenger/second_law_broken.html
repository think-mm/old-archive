	<h1><font face="Palatino, Latin" color="#800000" size="5">Has the Second Law

	</center><center><b><font face="Geneva" size="4"><a href="index.html">Vic Stenger</a></font></b></center>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">On Thursday, July 18, 2002, 11:09 GMT the 
	BBC Online News reported breathlessly: &quot;One of the most important principles 
	of physics, that disorder, or entropy, always increases, has been shown to 
	be untrue&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;[<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_2135000/2135779.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_2135000/2135779.stm</a>].
	</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">The article, written by Online News Science 
	editor Dr David Whitehouse, described new observations by scientists at the 
	Australian National University (ANU) in which the entropy of a system of 
	microscopic beads in a water filled container was found to decrease for 
	periods up to a two seconds. [G. M. Wang et al, <i>Physical Review Letters
	</i>89 050601 (2002)].</font> <br>
	<font face="Palatino, Latin">Here's how the BBC explained the significance 
	of this result:</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;&quot;The law of entropy, or the Second Law of 
	Thermodynamics, is one of the bedrocks on which modern theoretical physics 
	is based. It is one of a handful of laws about which physicists feel most 
	certain.</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">So much so that there is a common adage that 
	if anyone has a theory that violates the Second Law then, without any 
	discussion, that theory must certainly be wrong.</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">The Second Law states that the entropy -- or 
	disorder -- of a closed system always increases. Put simply, it says that 
	things fall apart, disorder overcomes everything -- eventually. But when 
	this principle is applied to small systems such as collections of molecules 
	there is a paradox.&quot;</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">Contrast this report with one provided the 
	previous day by the American Institute of Physics in its online <i>Physics 
	News Update</i> [<a href="http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/598.html">http://www.aip.org/enews/physnews/2002/598.html]</a>. 
	The article by Phil Schewe, James Riordon, and Ben Stein stated that</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;&quot;Australian researchers have experimentally 
	shown that microscopic systems (a nano- machine) may spontaneously become 
	more orderly for short periods of time하 development that would be 
	tantamount to violating the second law of thermodynamics, if it happened in 
	a larger system. Don't worry, nature still rigorously enforces the venerable 
	second law in macroscopic systems, but engineers will want to keep limits to 
	the second law in mind when designing nanoscale machines.&quot;</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;This is a far more accurate statement than 
	the one provided by the BBC. In the nineteenth century, Lord Kelvin 
	introduced the second law to describe the observation that heat always flows 
	from hot to cold. The first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, 
	allows for energy to be exchanged in any direction. Students and patent 
	officers are taught that the second law forbids a perpetual motion 
	machine하n engine that can do work by taking energy from its environment. 
	Rudolph Claussius framed the second law in terms of a quantity called <i>
	entropy</i> which is required to remain constant or increase for any 
	isolated system. This implied that certain thermodynamic processes such as 
	heat flow are <i>irreversible</i>.</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;Toward the end of the nineteenth century, 
	Ludwig Boltzmann showed that that second law of thermodynamics is a 
	statistical statement about the behavior of particles. He proved that the 
	molecules of a system tend to approach their equilibrium distribution when 
	started off away from equilibrium. That equilibrium is characterized by a 
	certain quantity H, which is essentially negative entropy, approaching a 
	minimum. In short, Boltzmann basically derived the second law by assuming 
	that matter was composed of particulate bodies하toms and molecules하nd 
	applying Newtonian particle mechanics along with principles of statistics.</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;So, has a violation of the second law of 
	thermodynamics been demonstrated in an Australian laboratory? Hardly. This 
	minimum in H, or maximum in entropy, is just a statistical average and real 
	systems will fluctuate about this average. These fluctuations are very small 
	for the large number of molecules in common objects, but the fact remains 
	that entropy will fluctuate up and down. About the only surprise in these 
	new results is that violations can be found in a system as large as 
	micron--sized beads in water. The authors claim they are consistent with 
	their previously published <i>fluctational theorem</i>, derived from 
	established physics.</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;If the experiment is correct, the beads 
	momentarily gained energy from their environment. However, this perpetual 
	motion machine only worked for about two seconds and is not a likely 
	practical device. Over longer time periods, the average behavior will be 
	governed by the statistics of the second law. The main implication is that 
	engineers building nanoscale machines need to be prepared for them to behave 
	strangely, occasionally running backwards. Such effects may also be seen in 
	microbiology where cells and microbes are of comparable dimensions.</font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;An interesting philosophical issue is 
	raised by these results. It has long been known that a direction of time 
	cannot be found in the equations of classical physics. In modern physics, a 
	small time asymmetry is seen in very rare processes, but no known mechanism 
	provides for the stark time irreversibility of common experience. Although 
	the issue is still hotly debated, some quantum processes may even provide 
	evidence for &quot;backward causality,&quot; as I discussed in my book <i>Timeless 
	Reality</i> (Prometheus, 2000).</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Palatino, Latin">&nbsp;Sir Arthur Eddington coined the term &quot;Arrow 
	of Time&quot; to describe the direction of time provided by the second law. In 
	that case, the second law is really not a &quot;law&quot; at all but a definition of 
	the Arrow of Time. The direction of time is simply the direction in which 
	the total entropy of an isolated system increase. As such, it is useful only 
	for systems of large numbers of particles, such as those of common 
	experience. While no physicist will be astonished by the Australian result, 
	philosophers should regard it as an empirical conformation of the fact that 
	the direction of time is arbitrary. All that prevents sequences of events 
	from happening in the time direction opposite to that of common experience 
	are the laws of chance.</font> <br>
