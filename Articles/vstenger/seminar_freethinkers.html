  <h2><b><font size="+2" color="#ef1f1d">Introduction</font></b></h2>
  <p><br>
  This is not meant to be a course in the Philosophy of Religion. I am an
  experimental physicist by training and experience and think like an
  experimental physicist. For reasons I will explain, scientific responses to
  theist arguments can be among the most powerful. Furthermore, theists
  themselves are relying increasingly on science to make their case. They have
  discovered a receptive audience among laypeople who usually lack the training
  to examine scientific claims critically but have a deep respect for scientific
  authority. Recasting traditional beliefs in scientific language gives them
  greater credibility in the minds of many,
  <p>In books on the Philosophy of Religion you will find discussions on the
  arguments for the existence of God that go back to Plato and Aristotle. If you
  want a short, clear introduction, I recommend <b><i><font color="#6c18b0">The
  God of Philosophy</font></i></b> by Ray Jackson, a paperback that can be
  ordered from <a href="http://www.philosophers.co.uk/religion">www.philosophers.co.uk/religion.</a>
  This site has much useful material on the subject. I also recommend the <b><font color="#ef1f1d">Secular
  Web</font></b> at <a href="http://www.infidels.org">www.infidels.org</a> for
  many links to philosophical arguments against theism. Other useful <a href="#Links">links</a>
  are given below.
  <p>The arguments you will hear from theist acquaintances or read in letters to
  the editor were more likely learned from church sermons and religious media
  than in a secular university class room. They are based more on &quot;common
  sense&quot; than deep logic and objective scholarship and usually presented as
  obvious conclusions--&quot;self-evident&quot; truths. However, sometimes they
  may also be based on the more sophisticated argments of theistic philosophers
  and theologians. We will cover those one hears most often these days, where
  science play a much larger role in the discussion than it has in the past.
  <p>Theist arguments are usually presented in logical form. Initial statements
  are made that constitute the premises. Then, conclusions are deduced from
  these premises. We may question both the premises and the deductions made from
  those premises. The deductive process, in this case, is usually simple logic
  that anyone can follow and, by itself, is often not in error. However, even
  when the logic is impeccable, the conclusions rise or fall on the premises.
  Pure logic cannot say anything about the world outside our heads, and not much
  about what's inside either. Many of the tradition arguments for the existence
  of God, like the ontological argument, are ostensibly based on logic alone.
  But they still have premises that can be and have been challenged.
  <p>Even well-trained theistic philosophers will often declare their premises
  to be self-evidently true. However, if an argument is meant to support a
  statement about reality, then the premise must be based on some knowledge of
  that reality. Traditionally, revelation via scriptures or direct religious
  experience is asserted as the source of such knowledge. Science, on the other
  hand, while not denying revelation outright, uses only observations and
  measurements as its base of knowledge. While it may be argued whether the
  scientific theories that are developed from its empirical knowledge base have
  anything to do with ultimate reality, the great success of science makes a
  strong case that science does indeed deal with reality. Furthermore, since
  religion does make claims that have observational implications, such as the
  power of prayer, scientific method can be used to test these claims.
  <p>I will not present the arguments and responses in a formal way. Rather, I
  will envisage dialogues between a <b>theist (T) </b>and <b>antitheist (A</b>)
  which summarizes in a few words the essence of each's position. I will try not
  to use the theist as a strawperson, but present his arguments as they are
  fequently heard. During the seminar sessions we will analyze and expand upon
  these dialogues. If new arguments arise, or better responses to these
  arguments are generated, these will be incorporated on this Web page.
  <p><i>Note on the burden of proof:</i> A common debating ploy used by theists
  to try to cast the burden of proof of the antitheist, asking her to
  &quot;prove&quot; that God does not exist or to &quot;prove&quot; that the
  universe is purely&nbsp; material. When that happens, be sure to cast the
  burden back on the theist. Remember that he is making the more extraordinary
  claim--that an unseen power exists that created the universe and responds to
  human needs.

  <p><br>
  <b>Theist (T):&nbsp;</b> Where did the universe come from?<br>
  <b>antitheist (A</b>): Why did it have to come from anything?
  <p><br>
  T: Everything has to come from something.<br>
  A: Then, you tell me. Where did the universe came from?</p>
  <p><br>
  T: The universe came from God.<br>
  A: Where did God come from?</p>
  <p><br>
  T: God did not have to come from anything. He always was.<br>
  A: Then everything does not have to come from something after all. Perhaps the
  universe always was.</p>
  <p>T: Philosopher William Lane Craig has argued that the universe had a
  beginning, therefore it must have had a cause. That cause is God.<br>
  A: Quantum events can happen without cause. Perhaps our universe was a quantum
  event in a larger universe that always was.
  <p><br>
  T: You have no evidence for this.<br>
  A: You have no evidence against it. Current physics and cosmology allow for
  such a scenario.</p>
  <p>T: How could this happen? Where did the matter and energy of the universe
  come from?<br>
  A: Matter was created from energy in the early universe. Observations indicate
  that the positive energy of matter is exactly balanced by negative
  gravitational potential energy. Thus, the total energy of the universe is zero
  and no energy (or very little--just the amount allowed by quantum mechanics)
  was required to produce the universe.
  <p>T: Where did the order of the universe come from?<br>
  A: It could have been produced spontaneously by natural processes of a type
  that are now beginning to be understood in physics. One such process is called
  &quot;spontaneous symmetry breaking.&quot; It's like the formation of a
  snowflake.
  <p>T: Still, the second law of thermodynamics says that disorder, or entropy,
  must increase with time. It must have started out more orderly than it is now,
  as created by God.<br>
  A: An expanding universe allows increasing room for order to form. The
  universe could have started as a tiny black hole with maximum entropy,
  produced by a quantum fluctuation, and then exploded in the big bang.
  <p><br>
  T: You can't prove that. No one was there to see it.<br>
  A: You can't disprove it. Such a scenario is allowed by current scientific
  knowledge.</p>
  <p>T: Many prominent scientists don't think the big bang happened. What does
  that do to your scenario?<br>
  A: The data from cosmological observ ations, which has improved enormously in
  just the last few years, has left no doubt among current working cosmologists
  that the big bang happened. The remaining holdouts are a few older astronomers
  who are gradually dying out. They are like some nineteenth century chemists
  and physicists who refused to accept the atomic theory to their dying days.
  Furthermore, the big bang is used by theists such as Craig and Hugh Ross to
  support their theologies. It does not, but I caution atheists not to argue
  against theism by saying the big bang did not occur. It very definitely did.
  <p>T: But isn't the universe fine tuned for life? Isn't it true that the
  slightest change of any one of a number of physics constants would make life
  impossible? Is this not evidence for a universe intelligently designed for
  life?<br>
  A: The universe is not fine tuned for life. Life is fine tuned for the
  universe. If we had a universe with different constants, we might have a
  different kind of life.<br>
  <p>T : Doesn't life require carbon, which would not exist without a delicate
  balance of nuclear parameters?<br>
  A: Our kind of life, yes. We do not know about other kinds of life.<br>
  </p>
  <p>T: You can't prove that life is possible without carbon.<br>
  A: I do not have the burden of proof here. You are making the claim that only
  one kind of life is possible, carbon-based life. You have to prove that. I am
  simply saying that we do not know and so cannot say the universe is designed
  for life as we know it. It could have been an accident. Nothing in current
  science says that is impossible,</p>
  <p>T: So, even if everything that happens is natural, as you claim, where did
  the laws of nature come from?<br>
  A: The laws of nature are misnamed. They are not necessarily rules that govern
  the universe, that sit out there in some kind of Platonic reality. They could
  just as well simply be human inventions, descriptions we have made of
  observations.<br>
  <p>T: Then they are subjective. We can all make our own laws.<br>
  A: Not quite. We can make up different laws if we want, but they are not
  scientific unless they agree with observations. The laws of physics can be
  written in many different ways, but they agree so well with the data that we
  are confident they describe aspects of reality.<br>
  </p>
  <p>T: Well, then where did those aspects of reality come from, if not from
  God?<br>
  A: Why did they have to come from anything? But, that's how we started this
  discussion.</p>
  <p>T: Still, you have to explain why there is something rather than nothing.<br>
  A: Define nothing.<br>
  </p>
  <p>T: Nothing. No thing. No matter, no energy, no space, no time, no laws of
  physics.<br>
  A: No God?<br>
  </p>
  <p>T: God is a separate entity who created matter, energy, space, time and the
  laws of physics from nothing.<br>
  A: I won't ask you again who created God. Rather, why was it necessary for the
  universe to have come from nothing?<br>
  </p>
  <p>T: It had to come from something.<br>
  A: But you just said it came from nothing!
