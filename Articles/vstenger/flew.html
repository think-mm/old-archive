  </div>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The late-in-life &quot;conversion&quot; of philosopher Antony 
  Flew from atheism to belief in God has been widely reported in the press.[1] 
  In a recent interview with Gary Habermas, misleadingly titled &quot;My Pilgrimage 
  from Atheism to Theism,&quot; Flew explains his new position, which is based more 
  on science than philosophy.[2] Although that interview contains a discussion 
  of other topics-such as the moral argument for God, which Flew does not buy, I 
  will only comment on the science.[3] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Flew identifies his new position as Deism, but does 
  not completely reject theistic revelation. As he tells Habermas, &quot; I am open 
  to it, but not enthusiastic about potential revelation from God. On the 
  positive side, for example, I am very much impressed with physicist Gerald 
  Schroeder's comments on Genesis 1. That this biblical account might be 
  scientifically accurate raises the possibility that it is revelation.&quot; </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Flew is also impressed by contemporary design 
  arguments: &quot; I think that the most impressive arguments for God's existence 
  are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries. I've never been 
  much impressed by the kal‰m cosmological argument,[4] and I don't think it has 
  gotten any stronger recently. However, I think the argument to Intelligent 
  Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b>Schroeder's Genesis:</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><br>
  In his 1998 book The Science of God,[5] Schroeder attempts to reconcile the 
  creation story in Genesis with modern cosmology.[6] He explains that the six 
  days of creation in the Bible really span 15.75 billion years &quot;cosmic time,&quot; 
  which is a mere 2 billion years above the current best estimate of the age of 
  the universe. The cosmic time for creation is obtained by multiplying the six 
  days of biblical time by the red shift of light at a moment in the early 
  universe called &quot;quark confinement,&quot; which is about a factor of a trillion. 
  The red shift tells us how much the wavelength of a particular atomic spectral 
  line in increased because of the expansion of the universe. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">According to Schroeder, the first day of creation is 
  eight billion years long. Each succeeding biblical day is half as long as long 
  as the previous one in cosmic time so, by the magic of the exponential 
  function, we arrive at the time of Adam and Eve, at which moment conventional 
  human time takes over. The 6,000 or so years from then to now, in human time, 
  is insignificant on this scale, the last day of creation being 250 million 
  years long. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Schroeder gets the answer he wants by using the red 
  shift at quark confinement. But the universe did not begin at quark 
  confinement. It actually began about a millionth of a second earlier, at the 
  so-called Planck time, when the red shift was twenty orders of magnitude 
  higher. That calculation would have the six days of creation lasting 16x1020 
  billion years! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Actually, a more sensible red shift would be that at 
  the time when radiation decouples from matter, that is, when &quot;light is 
  separated from darkness.&quot; But in the case the six days would only be expanded 
  to fifteen years. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">When I first read The Science of God I thought it was 
  a clever spoof on religious apologetics. Come on, Gerald, admit you are 
  pulling our legs! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In fact the creation story in Genesis looks nothing 
  like big bang cosmology, no mater how you try to spin it. In the Bible, the 
  universe is a firmament and Earth is fixed and immovable. In fact, the 
  universe is expanding and Earth rotates about the sun. In the Bible, Earth is 
  created in the first &quot;day,&quot; before the sun, moon, and stars. In fact, Earth 
  did not form until nine billions years after the big bang, after the sun and 
  other stars. If Genesis reveals anything, it is that God has a great sense of 
  humor. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana">Fine-Tuning and Intelligent Design:</font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><br>
  The mathematically and scientifically illiterate are also easily impressed by 
  other two recent variations on the ancient argument from design, which can be 
  simply stated: </font></p>
  <p></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><font face="Verdana">I cannot understand how the universe and the 
    enormous complexity of living things we see around us can have come about 
    naturally. Therefore, they must have been created supernaturally. </font>
    </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In 1802, William Paley could not understand how the 
  human eye, so fine-tuned for the collection of light and formation of images, 
  could have developed naturally. So, he concluded, it had to be designed by 
  God. Now we understand how eyes evolved several times by natural selection.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Today, Antony Flew cannot understand how the universe, 
  so fine-tuned for the manufacture of the materials needed for living 
  organisms, could have happened naturally. So, he apparently concludes, it had 
  to be designed by at some kind of minimal deity. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Apparently Flew is not aware that physicists and 
  cosmologists are not as totally stumped by fine-tuning as he seems to be. 
  While slight changes in the constants of physics could make life as we know it 
  impossible, what about life as we don't know it? We have no reason to believe 
  that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, 
  modern cosmology indicates that multiple universes may exist with different 
  constants and laws of physics. So, it is not surprising that we live in the 
  one suited for us. The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned 
  to the universe. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">I am surprised that philosopher Flew does not see the 
  flaws in the design argument, as exemplified by Michael Behe's &quot;Irreducible 
  complexity&quot; and William Dembski's &quot;Design Inference.&quot; They assume that a 
  complex system can only arise out of something with high intelligence. Surely 
  such intelligence is highly complex, and so can only have arisen out of 
  something even more intelligent and complex, in infinite regress. It's 
  intelligent designers all the way down, not Aristotle's first cause as Flew 
  seems to think. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Fortunately, as we know from everyday experience and 
  scientific observations, complex systems develop from simpler systems all the 
  time in nature, with no high intelligence needed. A drop of water can freeze 
  into an ice crystal. Winds can carve out great cathedrals in rock. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">And, our relatively complex universe can have arisen 
  out of the simplest object of all-the void. </font></p>
