  <p><b><font size="+2" face="Geneva, Arial">Why I am not an Agnostic</font></b>
  </p>
  <p><b><font face="Geneva" size="4"><a href="index.html">Vic Stenger</a></font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">Many non-believers say they are 
  agnostics rather than atheists. They do not think God exists, but they aren't 
  sure and so are unwilling to call themselves atheists. A common attitude is: 
  &quot;Maybe there is something out there. After all, we don't know everything.&quot;</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">How sure of God's non-existence must 
  we be to call ourselves atheists? Obviously we can't be 100 percent certain of 
  anything. But we can be 99.9999 percent certain of a lot of things, and that 
  is usually sufficient for making the decisions of everyday life. We can't be 
  certain that we will not fall and break our necks getting out of bed in the 
  morning, but we don't stay in bed all day because of this. We travel in cars 
  and airplanes where the probabilities of survival are not 100 percent, but 
  close enough to chance it. In these cases, we do a risk-benefit analysis and 
  decide that the benefits justify the risk.</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">Some things are, for all practical 
  purposes, certain. If we jump out of a ten story window, we can be pretty sure 
  of banging ourselves up badly, not by the fall, as they say, but by the stop. 
  Now, a plane with a mattress strapped to its wing might fly by under the 
  window at just the right time to save us. Again, as they say, &quot;anything is 
  possible.&quot; But this is an example of the sorts of possible things we have 
  learned not to count on.</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">So where is the border between 
  agnostic and atheist? If we draw the line at 100 percent certainty, then we 
  are leaving no room at all for atheists. In that case, we would have no 
  atheists in a fox hole or anywhere else. Yet, some people call themselves 
  atheists, including many who have spent time in fox holes. The word must mean 
  something to them. I suggest that atheists are people who have evaluated the 
  probabilities, done a risk-benefit analysis, and found that the existence of 
  God is so unlikely that they prefer to live their lives without all the 
  baggage that such belief forces you to carry.</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">The baggage of belief is heavy. Not 
  only are you expected to donate time and money to your church, but, more 
  importantly, you are expected to turn over your mind. And, as Dan Quayle has 
  said, &quot;a mind is a terrible thing to lose.&quot;</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">When you are a member of the faithful 
  of any religion, you are not free to use your own best judgement on what is 
  best for you, your family, and society. Instead, you are expected to defer to 
  the judgement of others who claim supernatural authority. And since they can 
  offer no real evidence to support their claim but their own word, you are 
  asked to suspend your own intellect in the process.</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font>
  </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">Throughout the ages, many attempts 
  have been made to provide a rational foundation for supernatural belief. All 
  have failed. Preachers can still attract customers among the unsophisticated 
  by logical-sounding arguments, such as: &quot;How could all this - the universe, 
  life, and mind - just have happened from nothing?&quot; They then assure their 
  listeners that God made it all. But consider the absurdity of the argument: 
  Something can't come from nothing, and so it must come from God - who came 
  from nothing.</font><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial"></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+0" face="Geneva, Arial">Ultimately, belief in an undetectable, 
  transcendent reality comes down to faith rather than reason. Churches have 
  convinced the majority of the human race to believe in the unbelievable, to 
  give credit to the incredible, to rationalize the irrational. An atheist is 
  someone who can't believe in something that has no rational basis, that is 
  nothing more than a fantasy and delusion left over from the ignorant and 
  superstitious childhood of the human race.</font> </p>
