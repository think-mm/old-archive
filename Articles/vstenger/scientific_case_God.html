		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">6.&nbsp; We can conclude

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">From a modern 
		scientific perspective, what are the empirical and theoretical 
		implications of a supernatural creation? We need to seek evidence that 
		the universe (1) had an origin and (2) that origin cannot have happened 
		naturally. One sign of a supernatural creation would be a direct 
		empirical confirmation that a miracle was necessary in order to bring 
		the universe into existence. That is, cosmological data should either 
		show evidence for one or more violations of well-established laws of 
		nature or the theories that successfully describe those data should 
		require some causal ingredient that cannot be understood in purely 
		material or natural terms. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Now, as philosopher 
		David Hume pointed out centuries ago, many problems exist with the whole 
		notion of miracles. Three types of possible miracles can be identified: 
		(1) violations of established laws of nature, (2) inexplicable events, 
		and (3) highly unlikely coincidences. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">If a violation of an 
		established law of nature is observed, then we might more reasonably 
		surmise that the law was wrong rather than conclude that an occurrence 
		of divine intervention has taken place. If we simply define a miracle as 
		an inexplicable occurrence, then how can we be sure that an explanation 
		will not someday be found? If we view some highly unlikely coincidence 
		as a miracle, how can we know it still was not a random accident? These 
		pose serious questions for anyone arguing from miracles to the existence 
		of God.<sup>1</sup> </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">However, that is not 
		the task I have undertaken. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Theologian Richard 
		Swinburne, who has undertaken that task, suggests that we define a 
		miracle as a non-repeatable exception to a law of nature.<sup>2</sup> Of 
		course, we can always redefine the law to include the exception, but 
		that would be somewhat arbitrary. Laws are meant to describe repeatable 
		events. So, we will seek evidence for violations of well-established 
		laws that do not repeat themselves in any lawful pattern. </span></font>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">No doubt God, if he 
		exists, is capable of repeating miracles if he so desires. However, 
		repeatable events provide more information that may lead to an eventual 
		natural explanation, while an unexplained, unrepeated event is likely to 
		remain unexplained. Let us give the God hypothesis every benefit of the 
		doubt and keep open the possibility of a miraculous origin for 
		inexplicable events and unlikely coincidences, examining any such 
		occurrences on an individual basis. If even with the loosest definition 
		of a miracle none is observed to occur, then we will have obtained 
		strong support for the case against the existence of a God who directs 
		miraculous events. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Let us proceed to 
		look for evidence of a miraculous creation in our observations of the 
		cosmos. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Creating Matter
		</b>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
		universe currently contains a large amount of matter that is 
		characterized by the physical quantity we define as mass. Prior to the 
		twentieth century, it was believed that matter could neither be created 
		nor destroyed, just changed from one type to another. So the very 
		existence of matter seemed to be a miracle, a violation of the assumed 
		law of conservation of mass that occurred just once—at the creation.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">However, in his 
		special theory of relativity published in 1905, Albert Einstein showed 
		that matter can be created out of energy and can disappear into energy. 
		His famous formula <i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i> relates the mass <i>m</i> 
		of a body to an equivalent rest energy, <i>E</i>, where <i>c</i> is a 
		universal constant, the speed of light in a vacuum. That is, for all 
		practical purposes, mass and rest energy are equivalent, with a body at 
		rest still containing energy. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">When a body is 
		moving, it carries an additional energy of motion called <i>kinetic 
		energy</i>. In chemical and nuclear interactions, kinetic energy can be 
		converted into rest energy, which is equivalent to generating mass.<sup>3</sup> 
		Also, the reverse happens; mass or rest energy can be converted into 
		kinetic energy. In that way, chemical and nuclear interactions can 
		generate kinetic energy, which then can be used to run engines or blow 
		things up. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">So, the existence of 
		mass in the universe violates no law of nature. It can come from energy. 
		But, where does the energy come from? One of the most important 
		principles of physics is the law of <i>conservation of energy</i>, also 
		known as the <i>first law of thermodynamics</i>, which requires that 
		energy come from somewhere. In principle, the creation hypothesis could 
		be confirmed by the direct observation or theoretical requirement that 
		conservation of energy was violated 13.7 billion years ago at the start 
		of the big bang. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">However, neither 
		observations nor theory indicate this to have been the case. The first 
		law allows energy to convert from one type to another as long as the 
		total for a closed system remains fixed. Remarkably, the sum of the rest 
		kinetic energies of the bodies in the early universe seems to have been 
		exactly cancelled by the negative potential energy that results from 
		their mutual gravitational interactions. Within small measurement errors 
		and quantum uncertainties, the mean energy density of the universe is 
		exactly what it should be for a universe that appeared from an initial 
		state of zero energy. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Furthermore, a close 
		balance between positive and negative energy is predicted by the modern 
		version of the big bang theory called the <i>inflationary big bang</i>, 
		according to which the universe underwent a period of rapid, exponential 
		inflation during a tiny fraction of its first second. The inflationary 
		theory has recently undergone a number of stringent observational tests 
		that would have been sufficient to prove it false. So far, it has passed 
		these tests with flying colors.<sup>4</sup></span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In short, the 
		existence of matter in the universe did not require the violation of 
		energy conservation at the assumed creation. In fact, the data strongly 
		support the hypothesis that no such miracle occurred. If we regard such 
		a miracle as predicted by the creator hypothesis, then that prediction 
		is not confirmed. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><b>Creating Order </b>
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Another prediction of 
		the creator hypothesis also fails to be confirmed by the data. If the 
		universe were created, then it should have possessed some degree of 
		order at the creation––the design that was inserted at that point by the 
		Grand Designer. This expectation of order is usually expressed in terms 
		of the <i>second law of thermodynamics</i>, which states that the total
		<i>entropy</i> or <i>disorder</i> of a closed system must remain 
		constant or increase with time. It would seem to follow that if the 
		universe today is a closed system, it could not always have been so. At 
		some point in the past, order must have been imparted from the outside.
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prior 
		to 1929, this was a strong argument for a creation. However, in that 
		year astronomer Edwin Hubble reported that the galaxies are moving away 
		from one another at speeds approximately proportional to their distance, 
		indicating that the universe is expanding. This formed the earliest 
		evidence for the big bang. For example, an expanding universe can have 
		started in total chaos and still form localized order consistent with 
		the second law. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The simplest way to 
		see this is with a (literally) homey example. Suppose that whenever you 
		clean your house, you empty the collected rubbish by tossing it out the 
		window into your yard. Eventually the yard would be filled with rubbish. 
		However, you can continue doing this with a simple expedient. Just keep 
		buying up the land around your house and you will always have more room 
		to toss the rubbish. You are able to maintain localized order––in your 
		house––at the expense of increased disorder in the rest of the universe.
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Similarly, parts of the universe can become more orderly as the rubbish, 
		or entropy, produced during the ordering process (think of it as 
		disorder being removed from the system being ordered) is tossed out into 
		the larger, ever-expanding surrounding space. The total entropy of the 
		universe increases as the universe expands, as required by the second 
		law. However, the maximum possible entropy increases even faster leaving 
		increasingly more room for order to form. The reason for this is that 
		the maximum entropy of a sphere of a certain radius (we are thinking of 
		the universe as a sphere) is that of a black hole of that radius. The 
		expanding universe is not a black hole and so has less than maximum 
		entropy. Thus, while becoming more disorderly on the whole as time goes 
		by, our expanding universe is not maximally disordered. But, once it 
		was.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Suppose we 
		extrapolate the expansion back 13.7 billion years to the earliest 
		definable moment when the universe was confined to the smallest possible 
		region of space that can be operationally defined, a <i>Planck sphere</i> 
		that has a radius equal to the <i>Planck length</i>, 1.6 x 10<sup>-35</sup> 
		meter. As expected from the second law, the universe at that time had 
		lower entropy than it has now. However, that entropy was also as high as 
		it possibly could have been for an object that small, because a sphere 
		of Planck dimensions is equivalent to a black hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This may require 
		further elaboration. We seem to be saying that the entropy of the 
		universe was maximal when the universe began, yet it has been increasing 
		ever since. Indeed, that’s exactly what we are saying. When the universe 
		began, its entropy was the highest it could be for an object of that 
		size, because the universe was equivalent to a black hole from which no 
		information can be extracted. Currently, the entropy is higher, but not 
		maximal, that is, not as high as it could be for an object of the 
		universe’s current size. The universe is no longer a black hole.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">When, at the 
		beginning of the big bang, the entropy was maximal, the disorder was 
		complete and no structure was present. So, the universe began with no 
		structure, but has structure today because its entropy is no longer 
		maximal.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In short, according 
		to our best current cosmological understanding, our universe began with 
		no structure or organization, designed or otherwise. It was a state of 
		chaos.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We are thus forced to 
		conclude that the order we now observe could <i>not</i> have been the 
		result of any initial design built into the universe at the so-called 
		creation. The universe preserves no record of what went on before the 
		big bang. The creator, if he existed, left no imprint. </span></font>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The empirical fact of 
		the big bang has led some theists to argue that this, in itself, 
		demonstrates the existence of a creator. In 1951, Pope Pius XII told the 
		Pontifical Academy, “Creation took place in time, therefore there is a 
		Creator, therefore God exists.”<sup>5</sup> The astronomer/priest 
		Georges-Henri Lemaître, who first proposed the idea of a big bang, 
		wisely advised the Pope not to make this statement “infallible.” </span>

		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Christian apologist 
		William Lane Craig has made a number of sophisticated arguments that he 
		claims show that the universe must have had a beginning and that 
		beginning implies a personal creator.<sup>6</sup> One argument is based 
		on <i>general relativity</i>, the modern theory of gravity that was 
		published by Einstein in 1916 and which has, since then, passed many

		earlier by Penrose, proposed that a <i>singularity</i> exists at the 
		beginning of the big bang.<sup>8</sup> Extrapolating general relativity 
		back to zero time, the universe gets smaller and smaller while the 
		density of the universe and the gravitational field increases. As the 
		size of the universe goes to zero, the density and gravitational field, 
		at least according to the mathematics of general relativity, become 
		infinite. At that point, Craig claims, time must stop and, therefore, no 
		prior time can exist. </span></font></p>

		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">However, Hawking has 
		repudiated his own earlier proof. In his bestseller <i>A Brief History 
		of Time</i> he avers, “There was in fact no singularity at the beginning 
		of the universe.”<sup>9</sup> This revised conclusion, concurred to by 
		Penrose, follows from quantum mechanics, the theory of atomic processes 
		that was developed in the years following the introduction of Einstein’s 
		theories of relativity. Quantum mechanics, which also is now confirmed 
		to great precision, tells us that general relativity, at least as 
		currently formulated, must break down at times less than the <i>Planck 
		time</i>, 6.4 x 10<sup>-44</sup> second, and distances smaller than the 
		Planck length, mentioned earlier. It follows that general relativity 
		cannot be used to imply that a singularity occurred prior to the Planck 
		time and Craig’s use of the singularity theorem for a beginning of time 
		is invalid. </span></font></p>

		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Craig and other 
		theists also make another, related argument that the universe had to 
		have had a beginning at some point because if it were infinitely old, it 
		would have taken an infinite time to reach the present. However, as 
		philosopher Keith Parsons has pointed out, “To say the universe is 
		infinitely old is to say that it had no beginning—not a beginning that 
		was infinitely long ago.”<sup>10</sup> </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Infinity is an 
		abstract mathematical concept that was precisely formulated in the work 
		of mathematician Georg Cantor in the late nineteenth century. However, 
		the symbol ‘∞’ is used in physics simply as a shorthand for “a very big 
		number.” Physics is counting. In physics, time is simply the count of 
		ticks on a clock. You can count backward as well as forward. Counting 
		forward you can get a very big but never mathematically infinite 
		positive number and time “never ends.” Counting backward you can get a 
		very big but never mathematically infinite negative number and time 
		“never begins.” Just as we never reach positive infinity, we never reach 
		negative infinity. Even if the universe does not have a mathematically 
		infinite number of events in the future, it still need not have an end. 
		Similarly, even if the universe does not have a mathematically infinite 
		number of events in the past, it still need not have a beginning. We can 
		always have one event follow another, and we can always have one event 
		precede another. </span></font></p>

		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Craig claims that if

		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The kalâm argument 
		has been severely challenged by philosophers on logical grounds,<sup>12</sup> 
		which need not be repeated here since we are focusing on the science. In 
		his writings, Craig takes the first premise to be self-evident, with no 
		justification other than common, everyday experience. That’s the type of 
		experience that tells us the world is flat. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In fact, physical 
		events at the atomic and subatomic level are observed to have no evident 
		cause. For example, when an atom in an excited energy level drops to a 
		lower level and emits a photon, a particle of light, we find no cause of 
		that event. Similarly, no cause is evident in the decay of a radioactive 
		nucleus. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Craig has retorted 
		that quantum events are still “caused,” just caused in a 
		non-predetermined manner—what he calls “probabilistic causality.” In 
		effect, Craig is thereby admitting that the “cause” in his first premise 
		could be an accidental one, something spontaneous—something not 
		predetermined. By allowing probabilistic cause, he destroys his own case 
		for a predetermined creation. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have a highly 
		successful theory of probabilistic causes—quantum mechanics. It does not 
		predict when a given event will occur and, indeed, assumes that 
		individual events are not predetermined. The one exception occurs in the 
		interpretation of quantum mechanics given by David Bohm.<sup> 13</sup> 
		This assumes the existence of yet undetected sub-quantum forces. While 
		this interpretation has some supporters, it is not generally accepted 
		because it requires superluminal connections that violate the principles 
		of special relativitiy.<sup>14</sup> More important, no evidence for 
		sub-quantum forces has been found.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Instead of predicting 
		individual events, quantum mechanics is used to predict the statistical 
		distribution of outcomes of ensembles of similar events. This it can do 
		with high precision. For example, a quantum calculation will tell you 
		how many nuclei in a large sample will have decayed after a given time. 
		Or you can predict the intensity of light from a group of excited atoms, 
		which is a measure of the total number of photons emitted. But neither 
		quantum mechanics nor any other existing theory—including Bohm’s—can say 
		anything about the behavior of an individual nucleus or atom. The 
		photons emitted in atomic transitions come into existence spontaneously, 
		as do the particles emitted in nuclear radiation. By so appearing, 
		without predetermination, they contradict the first premise. </span>
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
		case of radioactivity, the decays are observed to follow an exponential 
		decay “law.” However, this statistical law is exactly what you expect if 
		the probability for decay in a given small time interval is the same for 
		all time intervals of the same duration. In other words, the decay curve 
		itself is evidence for each individual event occurring unpredictably 
		and, by inference, without being predetermined.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Quantum mechanics and 
		classical (Newtonian) mechanics are not as separate and distance from 
		one another as is generally thought. Indeed, quantum mechanics changes 
		smoothly into classical mechanics when the parameters of the system, 
		such as masses, distances, and speeds approach the classical regime.<sup>15</sup> 
		When that happens, quantum probabilities collapse to either zero or 100 
		percent, which then gives us certainty at that level. However, we have 
		many examples where the probabilities are not zero or 100 percent. The 
		quantum probability calculations agree precisely with the observations 
		made on ensembles of similar events.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Note that, even if 
		the kalâm conclusion were sound and that the universe had a cause, why 
		could that cause itself not be natural? As it is, the kalâm argument 
		fails both empirically and theoretically without ever having to bring up 
		the second premise about the universe having a beginning. </span></font>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Nevertheless, another 
		nail in the coffin of the kalâm argument is provided by the fact that 
		the second premise also fails. As we saw above, the claim that the 
		universe began with the big bang has no basis in current physical and 
		cosmological knowledge. The observations confirming the big bang do not 
		rule out the possibility of a prior universe. Theoretical models have 
		been published suggesting mechanisms by which our current universe 
		appeared from a pre-existing one, for example, by a process called 
		quantum tunneling or so-called “quantum fluctuations.”<sup>16</sup> The 
		equations of cosmology that describe the early universe apply equally 
		for the other side of the time axis, so we have no reason to assume that 
		the universe began with the big bang. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We have already seen 
		that no miracle is evident in the big bang. It follows that its 
		appearance could have been natural. Indeed, this is the more rational 
		conclusion based on the absence of any violation of known physical 
		principles. Prominent physicists and cosmologists have published, in 
		reputable scientific journals, a number of proposals for how the 
		universe could have come about “from nothing” naturally.<sup>17</sup> 
		These are speculative, to be sure, but they are speculations based on 
		established knowledge. None violate any known laws of physics. These 
		authors do not claim to “prove” that this is how it all happened. The 
		burden of proof is on those who wish to claim these scenarios are 
		impossible. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: 200%" align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In short, empirical 
		data and the theories that successfully describe those data indicate 
		that the universe did not come about by a purposeful creation. Based on 
		our best current scientific knowledge, we conclude beyond a reasonable 
		doubt that a God who is the highly intelligent and powerful supernatural 
		creator of the physical universe does not exist. </span></font></p>
