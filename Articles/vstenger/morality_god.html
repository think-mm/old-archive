	<h2 align="justify"><font color="#800080" face="Verdana">What Is Right?</font></h2>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The religions of 
	the world, especially Christianity, have laid claim to the role of arbiters 
	of human behavior. They insist that they have the right to tell the rest of 
	us what is right and what is wrong because they have a special pipeline to 
	the place where right and wrong are defined—in the mind of God.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even secular 
	societies pay tribute to this claim. Whenever a moral issue arises in 
	politics, such as stem-cell research or when to end life support, clergy are 
	called upon to provide their wisdom. On the other hand, the opinions of 
	atheists, freethinkers, and humanists are rarely solicited and frequently 
	reviled.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Society's 
	submission to religion on matters of morality is based on the widespread 
	assumption that an absolute good of divine origin exists. Of course, all 
	this depends on the definition of good. A logical problem exists in 
	associating good with divine command. In Plato's dialogue <i>Euthyphro,</i><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal"> 
	Socrates meets a young man of that name who is presented with a dilemma. He 
	is called upon to prosecute his own father for manslaughter and must decide 
	between following his conscience and supporting his father or prosecuting 
	him as the gods command.</span></font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Euthyphro 
	chooses to prosecute, arguing that he must follow the gods' will. However, 
	Socrates tells him that it is wrong to obey the gods if you think that there 
	is a <i>higher good</i><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal">.</span></font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theist 
	is faced with the same dilemma. Does God will us to do certain acts because 
	they are good or is an act good because God wills it? </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Suppose God were to appear before you and demand that 
	you kill your son, as in the biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac. Would you 
	obey God, as Abraham was prepared to do, or appeal to some instinctive 
	higher good?</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theist 
	may respond that God would never ask you to do something that was not good. 
	But he thereby admits that God does not determine what is good after 
	all—that good exists independent of God. If God solely determines what is 
	good, then he can decide that killing your son is good. </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The God of the Old Testament frequently demands that 
	atrocities be committed in his name. Let us look at some examples that are 
	rarely mentioned in Sunday school.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">After winning a large number captives in a battle, 
	Moses tells his army, who had already slain every adult male at God's 
	command,</font></p>

	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, 
	and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the 
	young girls who have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for 
	yourselves. (Numbers 31:17-18 RSV) </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At another 
	time, Moses orders three thousand men put to the sword on God's authority:
	</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">And he said to them, &quot;Thus says the Lord God of Israel, 
	'Put every man his sword on his side, and go to and fro from gate to gate 
	throughout the camp, and slay every man his companion, and every man his 
	neighbor.' &quot; (Exodus 32:27 RSV)</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Now, I am sure many Christians would dismiss these as 
	anachronisms that were eliminated with the coming of Jesus. However, in the 
	New Testament Jesus frequently reaffirms the laws of the prophets: </font>

	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians 
	like to pride themselves on their &quot;family values&quot; and their desire for peace 
	in the world. No doubt, most are devoted to their families and upright 
	members of society. But they fail to remember that Jesus said:</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Do not think that I have come to send peace on earth: I 
	have not come to send peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man at 
	against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law 
	against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own 
	household. He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; 
	and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. (Matthew 
	10:34-37 RSV)</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Where did the 
	notion arise that Jesus was the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;?</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The history of Christendom abounds with violence 
	sanctioned by the Church and thereby defined as divinely inspired &quot;good.&quot; 
	This divine inspiration is not limited to Scripture but continually 
	available to the specially anointed. Pope Urban II (d. 1099) assured the 
	medieval knights of the Crusades that the killing of infidels was not a sin. 
	And this did not apply just to Muslims in the Holy Land. The Cathar faith in 
	southern France, which was apparently based on the notion of dual gods that 
	appeared earlier in Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism,<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a> 
	was brutally suppressed in the Albigensian Crusade in the thirteenth 
	century. <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times-Roman">When the besieged Cathar 
	city of Beziers fell in 1209, soldiers reportedly asked their papal adviser 
	how to distinguish the faithful from the infidel among the captives. He 
	recommended: &quot;Kill them all. God will know his own.&quot; Nearly 20,000 were 
	slaughtered—many first blinded, mutilated, dragged behind horses, or used 
	for target practice.<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[2]</span></a>
	</span></font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">If our solution to the Euthyphro dilemma is to define 
	as good whatever God says is good, where God's word is defined as what is 
	revealed in scriptures and other holy sources, then Jewish and Christian 
	soldiers have a moral obligation to kill every enemy soldier and 
	civilian—except for the virgins, which they have a moral obligation to keep 
	for their own pleasure. </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are 
	to rely literally on the Bible for moral guidance, then Jews and Christians 
	have other obligations. For example, they are required to kill any family 
	member who tries to convert them to another religion:</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, 
	or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your 
	own soul, entices you secretly, saying, `Let us go and serve other gods,' 
	which neither you nor your fathers have known, some of the gods of the 
	peoples that are round about you, whether near you or far off from you, from 
	the one end of the earth to the other, you shall not yield to him or listen 
	to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him, nor shall you 
	conceal him; but you shall kill him; your hand shall be first against him to 
	put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. You shall stone 
	him to death with stones, because he sought to draw you away from the LORD 
	your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 
	bondage. (Deuteronomy 13:6-11 RSV) </font></p>

	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Some theologians suggest God has mysterious reasons to 
	command these awful acts that we mere humans are unable to comprehend. Does 
	that mean we are to carry them out despite what our own consciences say? 
	Even if God appeared before me and threatened me with damnation unless I 
	killed my son, I still would not do it. I suspect most other fathers and 
	mothers would act likewise. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">Obviously, few modern Jews and Christians take these 
	scriptural passages literally. But this leaves them on the horns of the

	<font face="Verdana">Of course, the Qur'an is as bloodthirsty as the Old

	noble ideals that the human race has done well to adopt as norms of behavior 
	and, where appropriate, to codify into law. But without exception, these

	that they were adopted by rather than learned from religion. It is fine that

	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The sentiments attributed to Christ are . . . already 
	found in the Old Testament. . . . They were familiar in the Jewish schools, 
	and to all the Pharisees, long before the time of Christ, as they were 
	familiar in all the civilizations of the earth—Egyptian, Babylonian, and 
	Persian, Greek and Hindu.<a title name="_ednref8" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[8]</span></a></font></p>

	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">As with the Bible, the Qur'an contains many sentiments 
	that most of us would classify as commendable. It tells Muslims to be kind 
	to their parents, not to steal from orphans, not to lend money at excess 
	interest, to help the needy, and not to kill their children unless it is 
	necessary. </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">But, again, these are not original moral principles. In 
	the scriptures and other teachings of the great monotheisms we find a 
	repetition of common ideals that arose during the gradual evolution of human 
	societies, as they became more civilized, developed rational thinking 
	process, and discovered how to live together in greater harmony. The 
	evidence points to a source other than the revelations claimed in these 
	scriptures.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font color="#800080" face="Verdana">Observing Moral 
	Behavior</font></h2>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The scientific 
	perspective is rarely invoked in discussions about morality. However, the 
	behavior of humans in both a personal and societal context constitutes 
	observable phenomena. These observations can be used as empirical data in a 
	scientific study of morals and values. Let us consider some of the facts 
	about human behavior that we can all see by simply looking around us.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The majority of human beings behave more-or-less 
	morally by a set of commonly accepted standards. While we live in a society 
	of law, much of what we do is not constrained by law but performed 
	voluntarily. For example, we have many opportunities to cheat and steal in 
	situations where the chance of being caught is negligible, yet most of us do 
	not cheat and steal. While the Golden Rule is not usually obeyed to the 
	letter, we generally do not try to harm others. Indeed, we are sympathetic 
	when we see a person or animal in distress and often take actions to relieve 
	that stress. We stop at auto accidents and render aid. We call the police 
	when we witness a crime. We take care of children, aged parents, and others 
	less fortunate than us. We willingly take on risky jobs, such as in the 
	military or public safety, for the protection of the community.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">While many people will attribute their moral behavior 
	to the teachings of their faiths, there is no evidence that people of no 
	faith behave substantially differently. They seem to apply the same common 
	set of moral principles.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Of course, this common set of moral principles is not 
	equal to the complete set of all moral principles. Not everyone agrees on 
	every moral issue. These disagreements can be very pronounced even within 
	specific religious communities, where the scriptures are often used to 
	justify contradictory actions.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">For example, consider the opposing interpretations of 
	the commandment against killing found within the Christian community. 
	Catholics and conservative Protestants interpret this commandment as 
	prohibiting abortion, removing life-support systems from the incurable, and 
	stem-cell research among other actions. However, many in this group of 
	believers do not view capital punishment as prohibited, pointing to the 
	biblical prescription of an eye for an eye. Liberal Christians, on the other 
	hand, may interpret the commandment as forbidding capital punishment, while 
	allowing abortion, the removal of life-support, and stem-cell research.
	</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">As philosopher Theodore Schick points out, both sides 
	of the abortion debate believe murder is immoral. Where they disagree is on 
	the nature of a fetus—whether or not it is the sort of entity that can be 
	murdered. In other words, moral disagreements are often not about what is 
	good or bad but about some other aspect of reality.<a title name="_ednref9" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[9]</span></a>
	</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The Bible is not clear on what may be killed and what 
	may not be. It does not explicitly sanction or forbid the killing of a fetus 
	or stem cell. And, it certainly sanctions the killing of enemies, 
	specifically those who do not worship Yahweh.</font></p>

	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For many 
	centuries, Europeans (as people elsewhere) were governed by despotic rulers 
	who lived lavish lives while the great bulk of their subjects were held in 
	miserable poverty and subject to the ruler's whim in every aspect of their 
	lives. No matter how cruel or incompetent, the ruler claimed the divine 
	right of kings. Why else would he be sitting on the throne if God did not 
	intend him to be there? Similarly, for centuries Islam was marked by the 
	rule of despots with unrestrained power. </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Christendom and Islam have a long history of

	demonstrated the power of reason.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the 
	prevailing myths in modern America is that the nation was founded on 
	&quot;Christian principles.&quot; However, God appears nowhere in the Constitution. 
	And, the &quot;Creator&quot; in the Declaration of Independence is not the Christian 
	God but the deist god of the Enlightenment and Thomas Jefferson. Most of the

	<font face="Verdana">Most believers not only reject the many atrocities 
	committed by God and the major figures of the Bible, but ignore more benign 
	rules as well. For example, hardly any Christians follow Jesus' command that 
	they pray in private: </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; 
	for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, 
	that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have received their 
	reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to 
	your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward 
	you. (Matthew 6:5-6 RSV)</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In dramatic 
	disobedience to Christ's direct and unambiguous order, Christians everywhere 
	make a great public show of their piety by loudly and visibly praying in 
	Churches, at political events, and around school flagpoles. They object 
	furiously when courts rule against prayers in public schools. How can 
	Christians morally justify this—other than by their own sense that praying 
	in public is good despite what Jesus said? </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">How many Christians of any stripe obey their Lord's 
	command to &quot;Love your enemy&quot; when it comes to Hitler or Osama bin Laden? 
	And, why should they?</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">In short, the empirical facts indicate that most humans 
	are moral animals whose sense of right and wrong conflicts with the many of 
	the teachings of the great monotheistic religions. We can safely conclude 
	they did not originate at that source.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font color="#800080" face="Verdana">Empirical Morality</font></h2>
	<p class="Manuscript" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If human morals 
	and values do not arise out of divine command, then where do they come from? 
	A considerable literature exists on the possible natural (biological, 
	cultural, evolutionary) origins of morality.<a title name="_ednref15" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[15]</span></a> 
	Darwin saw the evolutionary advantage of cooperation and altruism and modern 
	thinkers have elaborated on this observation, showing in detail how our 
	moral sense may have arisen naturally during the development of modern 
	humanity.</font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">We can even see signs of moral, or proto-moral behavior 
	in animals. Vampire bats share food. Apes and monkeys comfort members of 
	their group who are upset and work together to get food. Dolphins push sick 
	members of a pod to the surface to get air. Whales will put themselves in 
	harm's way to help a wounded member of their group. Elephants try their best 
	to save wounded members of their families. </font></p>
	<p class="Manuscript" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.2in" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">In these examples we glimpse the beginnings of the 
	morality that advanced to higher levels with human biological and cultural 
	evolution.<a title name="_ednref16" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[16]</span></a> 
	It seems likely that this is where we humans have learned our sense of right 
	and wrong. We have taught it to ourselves.</font></p>
