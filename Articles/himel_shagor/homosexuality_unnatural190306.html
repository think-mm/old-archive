			<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/31712">
			&quot;unnaturalness&quot; of homosexuality</a>] raises the question of the 
			meaning of nature, natural, and similar terms. Theologians and other 
			moralists have said that [homosexual acts] violate the &quot;natural 
			law,&quot; and that they are therefore immoral and ought to be prohibited 
			by the state. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The word &quot;nature&quot; has a 
			built-in ambiguity that can lead to serious misunderstandings. When 
			something is said to be &quot;natural&quot; or in conformity with &quot;natural 
			law&quot; or the &quot;law of nature,&quot; this may mean either (1) that it is in 
			conformity with the descriptive laws of nature, or (2) that it is 
			not artificial, that man has not imposed his will or his devices 
			upon events or conditions as they exist or would have existed 
			without such interference. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>1. THE DESCRIPTIVE LAWS 
			OF NATURE </b></font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The laws of nature, as these 
			are understood by the scientist, differ from the laws of man. The 
			former are purely descriptive, whereas the latter are prescriptive. 
			When a scientist says that water boils at 212 Fahrenheit or that the 
			volume of a gas varies directly with the heat that is applied to it 
			and inversely with the pressure, he means merely that as a matter of 
			recorded and observable fact, pure water under standard conditions 
			always boils at precisely 212 Fahrenheit and that as a matter of 
			observed fact, the volume of a gas rises as it is heated and falls 
			as pressure is applied to it. These &quot;laws&quot; merely describe the 
			manner in which physical substances actually behave. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They differ from municipal 
			and federal laws in that they do not prescribe behaviour. Unlike 
			manmade laws, natural laws are not passed by any legislator or group 
			of legislators; they are not proclaimed or announced; they impose no 
			obligation upon anyone or anything; their &quot;violation&quot; entails no 
			penalty, and there is no reward for &quot;following&quot; them or &quot;abiding by&quot; 
			them. When a scientist says that the air in a tire &quot;obeys&quot; the laws 
			of nature that &quot;govern&quot; gases, he does not mean that the air, having 
			been informed that it ought to behave in a certain way, behaves 
			appropriately under the right conditions. He means, rather, that as 
			a matter of fact, the air in a tire will behave like all other 
			gases. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In saying that Boyle's law 
			&quot;governs&quot; the behaviour of gases, he means merely that gases do, as 
			a matter of fact, behave in accordance with Boyle's law, and that 
			Boyle's law enables one to predict accurately what will happen to a 
			given quantity of gas as its pressure is raised; he does not mean to 
			suggest that some heavenly voice has proclaimed that all gases 
			should henceforth behave in accordance with the terms of Boyle's law 
			and that a ghostly policeman patrols the world, ready to mete out 
			punishments to any gases that &quot;violate&quot; the heavenly decree. </font>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, according to the 
			scientist, it does not make sense to speak of a natural law being 
			violated. For if there were a true exception to a so-called law of 
			nature, the exception would require a change in the description of 
			those phenomena, and the &quot;law&quot; would have been shown to be no law at 
			all. The laws of nature are revised as scientists discover new 
			phenomena that require new refinements in their descriptions of the 
			way things actually happen. In this respect, they differ 
			fundamentally from human laws, which are revised periodically by 
			legislators who are not so interested in describing human behaviour 
			as they are in prescribing what human behaviour should be. </font>
			</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>2. THE ARTIFICIAL AS A 
			FORM OF THE UNNATURAL </b></font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On occasion when we say that 
			something is not natural, we mean that it is a product of human 
			artifice. My typewriter is not a natural object, in this sense, for 
			the substances of which it is composed have been removed from their 
			natural state--the state in which they existed before men came 
			along--and have been transformed by a series of chemical and 
			physical and mechanical processes into other substances. They have 
			been rearranged into a whole that is quite different from anything 
			found in nature. In short, my typewriter is an artificial object.
			</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this sense, the clothing 
			that I wear as I lecture before my students is also not natural, for 
			it has been transformed considerably from the state in which it was 
			found in nature; and my wearing of clothing as I lecture before my 
			students is also not natural, in this sense, for in my natural 
			state, before the application of anything artificial, before any 
			human interference with things as they are, I am quite naked. Human 
			laws, being artificial conventions designed to exercise a degree of 
			control over the natural inclinations and propensities of men, may 
			in this sense be considered to be unnatural. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now when theologians and 
			moralists speak of homosexuality, contraception, abortion, and other 
			forms of human behaviour as being unnatural, and say that for that 
			reason such behaviour must be considered to be wrong, in what sense 
			are they using the word unnatural? Are they saying that homosexual 
			behaviour and the use of contraceptives are contrary to the 
			scientific laws of nature, are they saying that they are artificial 
			forms of behaviour, or are they using the terms natural and 
			unnatural in some third sense? </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They cannot mean that 
			homosexual behaviour (to stick to the subject presently under 
			discussion) violates the laws of nature in the first sense, for, as 
			we have pointed out, in that sense it is impossible to violate the 
			laws of nature. Those laws, being merely descriptive of what 
			actually does happen, would have to include homosexual behaviour if 
			such behaviour does actually take place. Even if the defenders of 
			the theological view that homosexuality is unnatural were to appeal 
			to a statistical analysis by pointing out that such behaviour is not 
			normal from a statistical point of view, and therefore not what the 
			laws of nature require, it would be open to their critics to reply 
			that any descriptive law of nature must account for and incorporate 
			all statistical deviations, and that the laws of nature, in this 
			sense, do not require anything. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These critics might also 
			note that the best statistics available reveal that about half of 
			all American males engage in homosexual activity at some time in 
			their lives, and that a very large percentage of American males have 
			exclusively homosexual relations for a fairly extensive period of 
			time; from which it would follow that such behaviour is natural, for 
			them, at any rate, in this sense of the word natural. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If those who say that 
			homosexual behaviour is unnatural are using the term unnatural in 
			the second sense, it is difficult to see why they should be fussing 
			over it. Certainly nothing is intrinsically wrong with going against 
			nature (if that is how it should be put) in this sense. That which 
			is artificial is often far better than what is natural. Artificial 
			homes seem, at any rate, to be more suited to human habitation and 
			more conducive to longer life and better health than caves and other 
			natural shelters. There are distinct advantages to the use of such 
			unnatural (i.e. artificial) amenities as clothes, furniture, and 
			books. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although we may dream of an 
			idyllic return to nature in our more wistful moments, we would soon 
			discover, as Thoreau did in his attempt to escape from the 
			artificiality of civilisation, that needles and thread, knives and 
			matches, ploughs and nails, and countless other products of human 
			artifice are essential to human life. We would discover, as Plato 
			pointed out in the Republic, that no man can be truly 
			self-sufficient. Some of the by-products of industry are less than 
			desirable; but neither industry itself, nor the products of 
			industry, are intrinsically evil, even though both are unnatural in 
			this sense of the word. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interference with nature is 
			not evil in itself. Nature, as some writers have put it, must be 
			tamed. In some respects man must look upon it as an enemy to be 
			conquered. If nature were left to its own devices, without the 
			intervention of human artifice, men would be consumed with disease, 
			they would be plagued by insects, they would be chained to the 
			places where they were born with no means of swift communication or 
			transport, and they would suffer the discomforts and the torments of 
			wind and weather and flood and fire with no practical means of 
			combating any of them. Interfering with nature, doing battle with 
			nature, using human will and reason and skill to thwart what might 
			otherwise follow from the conditions that prevail in the world, is a 
			peculiarly human enterprise, one that can hardly be condemned merely 
			because it does what is not natural. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Homosexual behaviour can 
			hardly be considered to be unnatural in this sense. There is nothing 
			&quot;artificial&quot; about such behaviour. On the contrary, it is quite 
			natural, in this sense, to those who engage in it. And even if it 
			were not, even if it were quite artificial, this is not in itself a 
			ground for condemning it. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It would seem then, that 
			those who condemn homosexuality as an unnatural form of behaviour 
			must mean something else by the word unnatural, something not 
			covered by either of the preceding definitions. A third possibility 
			is this: </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>3. ANYTHING UNCOMMON OR 
			ABNORMAL IS UNNATURAL </b></font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If this is what is meant by 
			those who condemn homosexuality on the ground that it is unnatural, 
			it is quite obvious that their condemnation cannot be accepted 
			without further argument, for the fact that a given form of 
			behaviour is uncommon provides no justification for condemning it. 
			Playing viola in a string quartet is no doubt an uncommon form of 
			human behaviour. I do not know what percentage of the human race 
			engages in such behaviour, or what percentage of his life any given 
			violist devotes to such behaviour, but I suspect that the number of 
			such people must be very small indeed, and that the total number of 
			man-hours spent in such activity would justify our calling that form 
			of activity uncommon, abnormal (in the sense that it is 
			statistically not the kind of thing that people are ordinarily 
			inclined to do), and therefore unnatural, in this sense of the word.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet there is no reason to 
			suppose that such uncommon, abnormal behaviour is, by virtue of its 
			uncommonness, deserving of condemnation or ethically or morally 
			wrong. On the contrary, many forms of behaviour are praised 
			precisely because they are so uncommon. Great artists, poets, 
			musicians, and scientists are &quot;abnormal&quot; in this sense; but clearly 
			the world is better off for having them, and it would be absurd to 
			condemn them or their activities for their failure to be common and 
			normal. If homosexual behaviour is wrong, then, it must be for some 
			reason other than its &quot;unnaturalness&quot; in this sense of the word.
			</font></p>

		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>4. ANY USE OF AN ORGAN OR 
			AN INSTRUMENT THAT IS CONTRARY TO ITS PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OR FUNCTION 
			IS UNNATURAL </b></font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every organ and every 
			instrument--perhaps even every creature--has a function to perform, 
			so some people argue, one for which it is particularly designed. Any 
			use of those instruments and organs that is consonant with their 
			purposes is natural and proper, but any use that is inconsistent 
			with their principal functions is unnatural and improper, and are to 
			that extent, evil or harmful. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Human teeth, they give as 
			example, are admirably designed for their principal 
			functions--biting and chewing the kinds of food suitable for human 
			consumption. But they are not particularly well suited for prying 
			the caps from beer bottles. If they are used for the latter purpose, 
			which is not natural to them, they are liable to crack or break 
			under the strain. The abuse of one's teeth leads to their 
			destruction and to a consequent deterioration in one's overall 
			health. If they are used only for their proper function, however, 
			they may continue to serve well for many years. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, they offer, a 
			given drug may have a proper function. If used in the furtherance of 
			that end, it can preserve life and restore health. But if it is 
			abused, and employed for purposes for which it was never intended, 
			it may cause serious harm and even death. The natural uses of things 
			are good and proper, but their unnatural uses are bad and harmful.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What we must do, then, is to 
			find the proper use, or the true purpose, of each organ in our 
			bodies. Once we have discovered that, we will know what constitutes 
			the natural use of each organ, and what constitutes an unnatural, 
			abusive, and potentially harmful employment of the various parts of 
			our bodies. If we are rational, we will be careful to confine our 
			behaviour to our proper functions and to refrain from unnatural 
			behaviour. According to those philosophers who follow this line of 
			reasoning, the way to discover the &quot;proper&quot; use of any organ is to 
			determine what it is peculiarly well suited to do. The eye is suited 
			for seeing, the ear for hearing, the nerves for transmitting 
			impulses from one part of the body to another, and so on. </font>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What are the sex organs 
			peculiarly suited to do? Obviously, they are peculiarly suited to 
			enable men and women to reproduce their own kind. No other organ in 
			the body is capable of fulfilling that function. It follows, 
			according to those who follow the natural-law line, that the 
			&quot;proper&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; function of the sex organs is reproduction, 
			and that strictly speaking, any use of those organs for other 
			purposes is unnatural, abusive, potentially harmful, and therefore 
			wrong. The sex organs have been given to use in order to enable us 
			to maintain the continued existence of mankind on this earth. All 
			perversions--including masturbation, homosexual behaviour, and 
			heterosexual intercourse that deliberately frustrates the design of 
			the sexual organs--are unnatural and bad. As Pope Pius XI once said, 
			&quot;Private individuals have no other power over the members of their 
			bodies than that which pertains to their natural ends.&quot; </font>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the problem is not so 
			easily resolved. Is it true that every organ has one and only one 
			proper function? A hammer may have been designed to pound nails, and 
			it may perform that particular job best. But it is not sinful to 
			employ a hammer to crack nuts if I have no other more suitable tool 
			immediately available. The hammer, being a relatively versatile 
			tool, may be employed in a number of ways. It has no one &quot;proper&quot; or 
			&quot;natural&quot; function. A woman's eyes are well adapted to seeing, it is 
			true. But they seem also to be well adapted to flirting. Is a 
			woman's use of her eyes for the latter purpose sinful merely because 
			she is not using them, at that moment, for their &quot;primary&quot; purpose 
			of seeing? </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our sexual organs are 
			uniquely adapted for procreation, but that is obviously not the only 
			function for which they are adapted. Human beings may--and do--use 
			those organs for a great many other purposes, and it is difficult to 
			see why any one use should be considered to be the only proper one. 
			The sex organs, for one thing, seem to be particularly well adapted 
			to give their owners and others intense sensations of pleasure. 
			Unless one believes that pleasure itself is bad, there seems to be 
			little reason to believe that the use of the sex organs for the 
			production of pleasure in oneself or in others is evil. In view of 
			the peculiar design of these organs, with their great concentration 
			of nerve endings, it would seem that they were designed (if they 
			were designed) with that very goal in mind, and that their use for 
			such purposes would be no more unnatural than their use for the 
			purpose of procreation. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nor should we overlook the 
			fact that human sex organs may be and are used to express, in the 
			deepest and most intimate way open to man, the love of one person 
			for another. Even the most ardent opponents of &quot;unfruitful&quot; 
			intercourse admit that sex does serve this function. They have 
			accordingly conceded that a man and his wife may have intercourse 
			even though she is pregnant, or past the age of child bearing, or in 
			the infertile period of her menstrual cycle. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Human beings are remarkably 
			complex and adaptable creatures. Neither they nor their organs can 
			properly be compared to hammers or to other tools. The analogy 
			quickly breaks down. The generalisation that a given organ or 
			instrument has one and only one proper function does not hold up, 
			even with regard to the simplest manufactured tools, for, as we have 
			seen, a tool may be used for more than one purpose--less effectively 
			than one especially designed for a given task, perhaps, but 
			&quot;properly&quot; and certainly not sinfully. A woman may use her eyes not 
			only to see and to flirt, but also to earn money--if she is, for 
			example, an actress or a model. Though neither of the latter 
			functions seems to have been a part of the original &quot;design,&quot; if one 
			may speak sensibly of design in this context, of the eye, it is 
			difficult to see why such a use of the eyes of a woman should be 
			considered sinful, perverse, or unnatural. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Her sex organs have the 
			unique capacity of producing ova and nurturing human embryos, under 
			the right conditions; but why should any other use of those organs, 
			including their use to bring pleasure to their owner or to someone 
			else, or to manifest love to another person, or even, perhaps, to 
			earn money, be regarded as perverse, sinful, or unnatural? Similarly 
			a man's sexual organs possess the unique capacity of causing the 
			generation of another human being, but if a man chooses to use them 
			for pleasure, or for the expression of love, or for some other 
			purpose--so long as he does not interfere with the rights of some 
			other person--the fact that his sex organs do have their unique 
			capabilities does not constitute a convincing justification for 
			condemning their other uses as being perverse, sinful, unnatural, or 
			criminal. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If a man &quot;perverts&quot; himself 
			by wiggling his ears for the entertainment of his neighbours instead 
			of using them exclusively for their &quot;natural&quot; function of hearing, 
			no one thinks of consigning him to prison. If he abuses his teeth by 
			using them to pull staples from memos--a function for which teeth 
			were clearly not designed--he is not accused of being immoral, 
			degraded, and degenerate. The fact that people are condemned for 
			using their sex organs for their own pleasure or profit, or for that 
			of others, may be more revealing about the prejudices and taboos of 
			our society than it is about our perception of the true nature or 
			purpose or &quot;end&quot; (whatever that might be) of our bodies. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To sum up, then, the 
			proposition that any use of an organ that is contrary to its 
			principal purpose or function is unnatural assumes that organs have 
			a principal purpose or function, but this may be denied on the 
			ground that the purpose or function of a given organ may vary 
			according to the needs or desires of its owner. It may be denied on 
			the ground that a given organ may have more than one principal 
			purpose or function, and any attempt to call one use or another the 
			only natural one seems to be arbitrary, if not question-begging. 
			Also, the proposition suggests that what is unnatural is evil or 
			depraved. This goes beyond the pure description of things, and 
			enters into the problem of the evaluation of human behaviour, which 
			leads us to the fifth meaning of &quot;natural.&quot; </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>5. THAT WHICH IS NATURAL 
			IS GOOD, AND WHATEVER IS UNNATURAL IS BAD </b></font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When one condemns 
			homosexuality or masturbation or the use of contraceptives on the 
			ground that it is unnatural, one implies that whatever is unnatural 
			is bad, wrongful, or perverse. But as we have seen, in some sense of 
			the word, the unnatural (i.e., the artificial) is often very good, 
			whereas that which is natural (i.e., that which has not been 
			subjected to human artifice or improvement) may be very bad indeed.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course interference with 
			nature may be bad. Ecologists have made us more aware than we have 
			ever been of the dangers of unplanned and uninformed interference 
			with nature. But this is not to say that all interference with 
			nature is bad. Every time a man cuts down a tree to make room for a 
			home for himself, or catches a fish to feed himself or his family, 
			he is interfering with nature. If men did not interfere with nature, 
			they would have no homes, they could eat no fish, and, in fact, they 
			could not survive. What, then, can be meant by those who say that 
			whatever is natural is good and whatever is unnatural is bad? </font>
			</p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Clearly, they cannot have 
			intended merely to reduce the word natural to a synonym of good, 
			right, and proper, and unnatural to a synonym of evil, wrong, 
			improper, corrupt and depraved. If that were all they had intended 
			to do, there would be very little to discuss as to whether a given 
			form of behaviour might be proper even though it is not in strict 
			conformity with someone's views of what is natural; for good and 
			natural, being synonyms, it would follow inevitably that whatever is 
			good must be natural and vice versa, by definition. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is certainly not what 
			the opponents of homosexuality have been saying when they claim that 
			homosexuality, being unnatural, is evil. For if it were, their claim 
			would be quite empty. They would be saying merely that 
			homosexuality, being evil, is evil--a redundancy that could as 
			easily be reduced to the simpler assertion that homosexuality is 
			evil. This assertion, however, is not an argument. Those who hold 
			that homosexuality and other sexual &quot;perversions&quot; are &quot;evil&quot; on the 
			ground that they are &quot;unnatural&quot; are saying that there is some 
			objectively identifiable quality in such behaviour that is 
			unnatural; and that that quality, once it has been identified by 
			some kind of scientific observation, can be seen to be detrimental 
			to those who engage in such behaviour, or to those around them; and 
			that because of the harm (physical, mental, moral, or spiritual) 
			that results from engaging in any behaviour possessing the attribute 
			of unnaturalness, such behaviour must be considered to be wrongful, 
			and should be discouraged by society. </font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Unnaturalness&quot; and 
			&quot;wrongness&quot; are not synonyms, then, but different concepts. The 
			problem with which we are wrestling is that we are unable to find a 
			meaning for unnatural that enables us to arrive at the conclusion 
			that homosexuality is unnatural or that if homosexuality is 
			unnatural, it is therefore wrongful behaviour. We have examined four 
			common meanings of natural and unnatural, and have seen that none of 
			them performs the task that it must perform if the advocates of this 
			argument are to prevail. Without some more satisfactory explanation 
			of the connection between the wrongfulness of homosexuality and its 
			alleged unnaturalness, the argument must be rejected.</font></div>
