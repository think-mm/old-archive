		History plays a crucial role in Bangladesh-Pakistan relations. 
		Bangladesh had won its independence from Pakistan after waging the War 
		of Liberation in 1971. Bengali who has suffered a lot during that period 
		expects an unconditional apology from Pakistan for the action of its 
		army.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><u>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">Hindus &amp; freedom fighters:</span></u></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"> 
		General Niazi who had surrendered to Joint Indian and Bangladeshi forces 
		on December 16, 1971, reportedly accepted in an interview in 1998 that 
		approximately thirty thousand Hindus were killed and many more 
		Bangladeshi freedom fighters in 1971. General Rao Forman Ali who is also 
		considered as one of the architects of the military action on Bengali on 
		March 25-26<sup>th</sup>, 1971 acknowledged that between <u>40,000 to 
		50,000</u> Bengali were killed. Though Pakistani people and leaders 
		accept this now in a roundabout way they still give the impression that 
		both sides were at fault. As army has always ruled Pakistan either 
		directly or indirectly, an apology against the acts of army has been 
		difficult to get.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><u>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">Division of assets:</span></u></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"> 
		Most important of them are division of assets of united Pakistan, and 
		repatriation of stranded Pakistanis (so-called &quot;Biharis&quot;) to Pakistan. 
		Bengali rightfully clams that Pakistan should pay at least $4 billion as 
		its share. Successive Pakistani governments have been reluctant to 
		discuss the issue of division of assets. They think that with the 
		passage of time this issue will die down. Bengali also wants Pakistan to 
		release US$200 million which was received by Pakistan as donation from 
		different countries for the 1970 cyclone victims of the then East 
		Pakistan.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><u>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">Bihari issue:</span></u></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"> 
		According to a 1992 census, there are 2,38,400 stranded Pakistanis in 66 
		camps in 13 districts in Bangladesh. These Urdu speaking people who had 
		migrated to Bangladesh from other parts of India. Bihari Muslims had 
		sided with Pakistan in the 1971 war. Since then Bangladesh has offered 
		them citizenship, but they refused, insisting on being expatriated to 
		Pakistan.</span><span class="htext1"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt"> The 
		other half of the Biharis lives outside of camps, were integrated into 
		the local community, were eligible to receive passports, to vote, and to 
		attend college, and were able to exercise most of the rights of 
		citizens. </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana">balance in 
		Pakistan. The issue of their repatriation has now become a humanitarian 
		issue. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan was the only 
		leader who agreed to take 325 &quot;Biharis&quot; in Pakistan in 1993. Other 
		leaders of Pakistan have consistently ignored the issue because of 
		fragile ethnic communities exist in the country.</span></p>

		</span></b><span style="font-family: Verdana">In 1974, the Commission, 
		after having established that numerous violations had been committed by 
		the army and auxiliary forces, came to the following conclusions: The 
		direct responsibility of the alleged excesses and atrocities must, of 
		course, rest on those officers and men who physically perpetuated them 
		or knowingly and deliberately allowed them to be so perpetuated. These 
		officers and men not only showed lack of discipline in disobeying the 
		directives of the Eastern Command and Zonal Martial Law Administrator, 
		but also indulged in criminal acts punishable under the Army Act as well 
		as the ordinary law of the land  Irrespective, therefore, of the 
		magnitude of the atrocities, we are of the considered opinion that it is 
		necessary for the Government of Pakistan to take effective action to 
		punish this [sic] who were responsible for the commission of these 
		alleged excesses and atrocities. Accordingly, the Committee recommended 
		that: [o]n the basis of the evidence coming before the Commission, we 
		have been able to indicate only in general terms the direct and indirect 
		responsibility of certain senior commanders and others, but the question 
		of fixing individual responsibility and awarding punishment appropriate 
		thereto need to be determined according to the prescribed procedures 
		available under the Pakistan Army Act and other applicable laws of the 
		land. We would, accordingly, reiterate the recommendation made by us in 
		Paragraph 7 of Chapter III of Para V of the main report that the 
		Government of Pakistan should set up a high-powered Court or Commission 
		of Inquiry to investigate these allegations, and to hold trials of those 
		who indulged in these atrocities, brought a bad name to the Pakistan 
		Army and alienated the sympathies of the local population by their acts 
		of wanton cruelty and immorality against our own people. The composition 
		of the Court of Inquiry, if not its proceedings, should be publicly 
		announced so as to satisfy national conscience and international 
		opinion.</span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">Pakistan has not officially accepted 
		responsibility for any of the crimes reportedly committed by its forces. 
		In Pakistan, responsibility for the 1971 atrocities is commonly 
		attributed to both sides, or to India. The crimes committed during 1971 
		appear to have been largely ignored in Pakistan. They do not merit due 
		attention in portraits of its history or in public discourse in general, 
		and are ostensibly seen as a shameful defeat of the Pakistani army often 
		attributed to Indian interference in Pakistani affairs. Those alleged to 
		be responsible, i.e. the politicians and army officials at the time, 
		have largely failed to acknowledge their crimes, apparently either 
		accepting only shared responsibility, i.e. pointing the blame at Sheikh 
		Mujibur Rahman and others, or claiming ignorance or lack of 
		responsibility for the atrocities. </span></p>

		Bangladesh in July 2002, Pakistans President Gen. Pervez Musharraf 
		wrote in a visitors book at the Savar War Memorial that the excesses 
		committed during the unfortunate period are regrettable. This step drew 
		mixed responses. While seen by some as a positive gesture in coming as 
		close to an apology as possible, others viewed it as falling short of 
		what they regard as overdue, namely an unconditional apology for war 
		crimes. To date, there has only been one explicit public apology issued 
		to the people of Bangladesh and it was made by a coalition of 51 civil 
		rights organisations of Pakistan.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">The military reign of terror in East 
		Pakistan was directed almost exclusively against the unarmed civilian 
		population. It was not a civil war of soldiers against a rebel army. It 
		can be divided roughly into three phases. First, there was the general 
		repression launched against all Bengalis, which began in March and 
		continued with varying intensity for nine months. The second phase was 
		the concentrated persecution of the Hindus, with the explicit intention 
		of eliminating the eight to ten million Hindus left in the country, 
		either by murdering them or driving them out. This second phase was 
		accompanied by a secondary persecution of the Hindus by their Muslim 
		neighbors with encouragement from the Army. The third phase was the 
		Collective Punitive Reprisal Program which increased tremendously when 
		the freedom fighters began hitting back.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">The first phase began in earnest on 
		March 26th. The Army simply loosed a reign of terror against all 
		Bengalis on the theory that if they were sufficiently savage and brutal, 
		they would break the spirit of the Bengali people, and not only stop the 
		rebellion but ensure that it would never happen again. In the beginning 
		this reign of terror took place in and around the cities. Prime targets 
		of the army were anyone who were or could be leaders; Awami League 
		politicians, professors, students, businessmen. But any Bengali was fair 
		game for any soldier. Although later on this general program of 
		repression of everyone was toned down, it never completely ceased. And 
		throughout the entire nine months in which at least a million died and 
		millions more fled the country, the Army remained immune from censure or 
		punishment. Rather they were highly praised by the President for their 
		activities. Justice was completely dead throughout the country.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">In April the second phase, the 
		concentrated persecution of the Hindus, began. By the beginning of May 
		it was obvious to observers that it was the Government's avowed 
		intention to kill or drive out of the country all of the eight to ten 
		million Hindus in East Pakistan. Throughout the country, the Army was 
		searching out Hindu villages and deliberately destroying them and 
		murdering the people. They would attack a village suddenly and swiftly, 
		killing any one they encountered, whether men, women or children. They 
		would then loot and burn the village to make sure that the poor people 
		had nothing to return to. Not even a pretence was made of being just. 
		The only evidence needed against these people was the fact that they 
		were Hindus. The Army would come into a new area, enquire where the 
		Hindus lived, and proceed to wipe them out. Sometimes they would claim 
		that the village was harbouring freedom fighters, but never did they 
		make any investigation to see if the charges were true. Throughout the 
		country, literally thousands of Hindu villages were destroyed in this 
		way. These people lost their homes, their possessions, their life 
		savings, their means of livelihood, and often their lives. Yet they were 
		guilty of no crime, and were not even accused of a crime. They were 
		simply marked for extermination.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">After the Army had clearly indicated 
		that they were out to exterminate the Hindu population, the lower 
		element among the Bengali Muslims began to take part in the terrorism. 
		Their motive was both hatred for the Hindus, and greed. For the 
		expulsion of the Hindus would enable them to take over their lands and 
		possessions. To satisfy their greed they stooped to drive out their 
		neighbors and let women and children suffer and starve and die. Local 
		Muslim leaders and Union Board Chairmen ordered the Hindus in their area 
		to get out within 24 hours, or they would call in the Army against them. 
		Knowing that it was not an idle threat, the Hindus had no choice but to 
		flee. In many areas, more harm was done to Bengali Hindus by Bengali 
		Muslims than by the West Pakistan Army.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">What was behind this persecution of 
		the Hindus? After a month of repression it was evident that the military 
		reign of terror was not succeeding as planned. The Muslim army resented 
		the fact that they had to kill their Muslim brothers when so many Hindus 
		were available. And there was a danger that the rebellion would succeed 
		since the savagery of the repression had angered the entire nation. So 
		the Army changed its tactics to make the Bengali revolt look like an 
		Indian instigated rebellion. They attacked the Hindus as Indian agents 
		and called on all Muslims to unite against the common enemy. They 
		succeeded in getting many Muslims to collaborate with them out of greed, 
		but the general run of Muslims were not fooled by the move. They knew 
		well who the real enemy was.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">The third phase of the Army program, 
		that of Collective Punitive Reprisals went into high gear when the 
		freedom fighters began to return from training and started their work of 
		sabotage and harassment of the military. This was the worst phase of all 
		in its cruelty and injustice toward civilians. Whenever any act of 
		sabotage occurred, the Army would immediately rush troops to the area. 
		The freedom fighters would of course be long gone, so the Army would 
		punish all the surrounding villages, burning and killing at will. No 
		effort was made to look for the guilty. The Army pattern of slaughter in 
		reprisal became so standardised that if a bridge or pylon was blown up 
		during the night, the entire civilian population of the area would 
		abandon their homes before daylight and flee into the interior. This 
		prevented the Army from killing so many, but it did not stop them from 
		looting and burning the homes. Day after day the sky was billowing with 
		smoke as thousands of homes were put to the torch. ..</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">My own personal experience underlines 
		the complete indifference of the Army to the question of innocence or 
		guilt. When a train was blown up nearby, the local doctor at first 
		refused to go to the help of the victims because if the Army should show 
		up they would immediately kill everyone on the scene. I knew it was 
		dangerous and that his fear was reasonable, so I agreed to accompany 
		him. When we were still too far from the wreck to be identified the Army 
		opened fire on us. The fact that there was no evidence of guilt was of 
		no consequence. We saved our lives only by abandoning our boat and 
		swimming to shore. In another boat in the area a man was killed and his 
		five year old son was fatally wounded. The little fellow lingered for a 
		month in our makeshift hospital, and finally died in pain and in fear. 
		During his long month of misery, every time he heard a gunshot, he 
		thought the Army was after him again and he would whimper to his 
		grieving mother, ' Mummy, will they shoot me again? Mummy, please don't 
		let them shoot me again '. These words from a five year old tell more 
		about the situation in East Pakistan, than volumes of testimony could. 
		This is what the Army created for the children of Bengal.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">The final figures on all this horror, 
		the full extent of the terrorism and of the denial of every human right 
		will probably never be known. A million may have died, or two million or 
		three. There may have been 10 million refugees or only five million. The 
		exact number is really immaterial. It is definitely one of the most 
		shameful episodes in the history of the human race; and it happened in 
		the enlightened 20th Century. And it will happen somewhere again, if the 
		Nations of the World take no steps to prevent it.'</span></p>

		men, women, and children--were all forced to line up. Young men between 
		the ages of 25 and 30 were lined up separately. 45 people were shot to 
		death on the spot. Three of Ali Akbar's brothers were killed there. Ali 
		Akbar was able to save himself by lying on the ground. But no one else 
		of that group was as fortunate. Nadanor was the Killing field. Every day 
		20 to 30 people were taken there with their hands tied behind their 
		backs, and killed. The dead bodies would be flung into the river. Apart 
		from this, a slaughter house was also readied for Bengalis. Manik, Omar, 
		and Ashraf were sent to Jessore Cantonment for training and then brought 
		to this slaughter house. Every day they would slaughter 9 to 12 persons 
		here. The rate per person was Taka ten. On one particular day, 45 
		persons were slaughtered here. From April 15 to December 10, the 
		butchery continued. It is gathered that 2,723 people lost their lives 
		here. People were brought here and bashed, then their ears were cut off, 
		and their eyes gouged out. Finally they were slaughtered... : The 
		Chairman of the Peace Committee was Moulana Solaiman. With Dr. Abul 
		Hussain and Abdul Rashid Mukhtar, he assisted in the genocide. Omar 
		would proudly say, &quot;During the day I am Omar, at night I am Shimar( 
		legendary executioner famous for extreme cruelty). Don't you see my 
		dagger? There are countless Kafirs (heretics) on it.&quot;</span></p>

		WASHINGTON: A vast proportion of information put out on Bangladesh in 
		1971 is marred by unsubstantiated sensationalism, while West Pakistan 
		and the Pakistan Army in particular have remained defensive and in a 
		state of denial about the killings, according to Sarmila Bose, a 
		Washington-based Indian academic.<br>
		<br>
		This and other findings are contained in the revised version of a paper

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">She writes, No rape of women by the 
		Pakistan Army (was) found in the specific case studies (that her 
		research involved). In all of the incidents involving the Pakistan Army 
		in the case studies, the armed forces were found not to have raped 
		women. While this cannot be extrapolated beyond the few incidents in 
		this study, it is significant, as in the popular narrative the 
		allegation of rape is often clubbed together with allegation of killing. 
		Rape allegations were made in prior verbal discussions in some cases and 
		survivors of the incidents testified to the violence and killings, but 
		also testified that no rape had taken place in these areas. While rape 
		is known to occur in all situations of war, charges and counter-charges 
		on rape form a particularly contentious issue in this conflict. The 
		absence of this particular form of violence in these instances 
		underlines the care that needs to be taken to distinguish between 
		circumstances in which rape may have taken place form those in which it 
		did not.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		According to Ms Bose, while the Bangladeshis are more voluble about the 
		birth of their country, they have done less well at systematic 
		historical record-keeping. She also found a cultivation of an unhealthy 
		victim culture by some of the pro-liberationists as people are 
		instigated at the national level to engage in a ghoulish competition 
		with six million Jews in order to gain international attention. These 
		tendencies, she points out, hamper the systematic study of the conflict 
		of 1971 and hinder a true understanding of a cataclysmic restructuring 
		in modern South Asian history. She writes that the 1971 civil war was 
		fought between those who believed they were fighting for a united 
		Pakistan and those who believed their chance for justice and progress 
		lay in an independent Bangladesh. Both are legitimate political 
		positions. All parties in the conflict embraced violence as a means to 
		the end, all committed acts of brutality outside accepted norms of 
		warfare, and all had their share of humanity. These attributes make the 
		1971 conflict suitable for efforts towards reconciliation, rather than 
		recrimination that has so far been its hallmark, she adds.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		Ms Bose writes that it was not a simple West vs East conflict. Most 
		political leaders in West Pakistan, barring Bhutto, were amenable to 
		transfer of power to the Awami League. Biharis and some Bengalis were 
		opposed to the breakup of Pakistan. Violence was not the means adopted 
		by only one side. According to her, Due to the successful emergence of 
		Bangladesh it is sometimes overlooked that in 1971, the defense of the 
		unity and integrity of Pakistan was a legitimate political position, 
		indeed the patriotic political position, as opposed to the secession 
		proposed by pro-liberation Bengalis. Pro-liberation Bengalis came to 
		see Pakistan as a foreign occupier while the loyalists were considered 
		traitors. <br>
		<br>
		Ms Bose writes, It is likely that, even after discounting 
		exaggerations, the armed forces and loyalist Bengalis may be responsible 
		for a greater proportion of casualties, due to greater fire power and a 
		longer period of holding the upper hand, following military action on 
		March 25. However, pro-liberation Bengalis also adopted violence as the 
		means to their end and their leadership did not uphold or enforce a 
		principled stand against violence towards unarmed people and political 
		opponents, presumed or real. In many areas, pro-liberation Bengalis 
		violence towards perceived opponents abated only upon arrival of the 
		army and resurfaced as soon as the war ended. The culture of violence 
		fomented by the conflict of 1971 forms the context of subsequent events 
		in Bangladesh.<br>
		<br>
		Ms Bose says that East Pakistan in 1971 was simultaneously a 
		battleground for many different kinds of violent conflict  military 
		rebellion, mob violence, guerrilla warfare, conventional battles, death 
		squads, civil war within Pakistan and between Bengalis, and full-scale 
		war between Pakistan and India. The conflict lasted for a year, 
		involving multiple combatant parties and different levels of conflict. 
		To ascertain the truth, it would be necessary to undertake an 
		institutional effort of national proportions, that Bangladesh has not 
		made, she adds. Her research is based on case studies from various 
		Bangladesh districts and accounts obtained from both perpetrators and 
		victims. The case studies, she cautions, are representative of the 
		conflict not comprehensive. She collected her data during visits to 
		Pakistan and Bangladesh during 2003-05. It has been her effort to 
		reconcile fact with fiction.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		Ms Bose writes that the movement led by Shaikh Mujibur Rehman was 
		openly and proudly armed and militant. The March 1 call for a general 
		strike by Mujib following the postponement of the National Assembly 
		session led to widespread lawlessness during that month, with the 
		government of Pakistan effectively losing control of much of the 
		province. There was a parallel government run on Mujibs decrees. 
		There was arson, looting and attacks by Bengali mobs on non-Bengali 
		people and property, some with casualties, the worst cases occurring in 
		Khulna and Chittagong. Most of these attacks were on civilians and 
		commercial properties, but some were directly on the army which remained 
		curiously unresponsive under orders. The army had difficulty buying 
		food and fuel and was being jeered and spat at while the curfew was 
		being violated. While the Awami League was unable or unwilling to 
		control a population it had incited, the regime failed to respond 
		appropriately to attacks on life and property.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		However, with the launch of Operation Searchlight on March 25, the 
		extraordinary restraint shown by the army was reversed, Ms Bose 
		writes. In the attack on Jagannath Hall at Dhaka University, the officer 
		in charge, Brig. Bobby Jahanzeb Arbab, admitted over-reaction and 
		over-kill by the troops. There was resistance but it was a very 
		unequal one. Gen AAK Niazi, whom the author interviewed, condemned Gen 
		Tikka Khans handling of the situation, comparing it with the 
		Jullianwala Bagh massacre by the British in 1919. While some soldiers 
		were gun-happy, others showed care and concern for the injured students. 
		Several faculty members and male members residing in the same buildings 
		were dragged out and shot. She found that there was no specific list of 
		Dhaka University staff that the army wanted liquidated. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		In one documented case, however, the soldiers had a name. The haphazard 
		nature of the military action resulted in certain university professors 
		being killed and political leaders either escaping to India or being 
		taken alive. She rejects as entirely false Anthony Mascarenhass claim 
		in the Sunday Times that 8,000 people were killed by the army in 
		Shankaripatti. Only 14 were killed.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		The military action was followed by a wave of mutiny by Bengali officers 
		and men in the army and police forces, but the pattern of violence 
		varied from place to place. In Mymensingh, many West Pakistani officers 
		were killed, their women assaulted and those trying to escape lynched by 
		the assembled population. Elsewhere, Bengali mobs slaughtered Biharis 
		and West Pakistanis until the army arrived to secure the area. A large 
		number of Bihari men, women and children were killed at the Crescent 
		Jute Mills in Khulna on March 27-28. This vicious cycle of 
		Bengali-Bihari ethnic violence continued even after Bangladeshs 
		establishment, she adds.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		Ms Bose writes that when the army moved to re-establish the writ of the 
		government, the initial resistance was sporadic and disorganised and 
		overwhelmed by the armys superior force. One Pakistani officer 
		confessed adopting a policy of prophylactic fire on the advice of Gen 
		Tikka Khan, though the general denied giving such advice. In this case, 
		any villages that came in the way of this particular column were burnt 
		down. Throughout April and into May, the army continued to bring 
		rebel-held territories under control. There were killings in some areas, 
		but not in others. In one village, where the moving troops had been 
		fired upon, all the men were gathered and shot. Their bodies were set on 
		fire. Another column secured a village without killing anyone. The 
		difference underlines the need for a deeper probe into the disregard for 
		human life or due process that characterised mass killings, the 
		academic writes.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		The Hindus were vulnerable during the civil war, even at the hand of 
		their fellow Muslim villagers. In Chuknagar, a Khulna village, a large 
		number of them were killed by an army patrol from Jessore. Women and 
		children were not harmed. After the soldiers left, the locals indulged 
		in rampant looting. As monsoon passed into autumn, young Bengali men 
		trained in Indian camps returned on a programme of sabotage. Many were 
		captured or killed; others survived. In the absence of any political 
		dialogue, the war dogged on at multiple levels, Ms Bose writes. She 
		narrates an incident on October 13 hear Kishoreganj in Mymensingh where 
		an army unit rounded up adult men from neighbouring villages and, for 
		reasons that remain unclear, lined them up in two queues and gunned them 
		down with mounted light machine guns. Residents from a particular 
		village were spared.<br>
		<br>
		Ms Bose writes that in the final days of the war, several professionals, 
		professors and doctors were picked up from their homes in Dhaka by Al 
		Badr loyalists of the army and were then blindfolded and killed. Several 
		of the bodies were found at a brick kiln. She states that a direct link 
		to the army is hard to establish as the men were picked up by Bengali 
		members of Al Badr. Some have held the late Maj Gen Rao Farman Ali 
		responsible, a charge he denied. There were revenge killings after 
		December 16, both of non-Bengalis and loyalist Bengalis, even a public 
		lynching before the cameras. Some were bayoneted. Another mass killing 
		of Biharis took place in Khulna in March 1972, when Mujib had already 
		taken power.</span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">I (Madhumita) was fifteen years old 
		and a student of grade VIII in 1971. Ours was a rich Hindu merchant 
		family and we lived in a composite Bengali village. On June 21, 1971, 
		local Bengali and Bihari men of the Muslim League, supporters of 
		Pakistan, came to our house. My family used to know them very well. They 
		came to arrest my father and brothers because our family was involved in 
		the liberation struggle and were supporters of the Mukti Bahini. But 
		when the Biharis approached our house, all the adult men fled. My 
		youngest brother, who was eleven years old, could not escape. I tried to 
		help him, but was apprehended by the attackers. They locked me in a 
		room; my brother was there too.</span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		After they finished their business they set the house on fire and walked 
		away. But I could not let my brother die. So I dragged myself and 
		despite the pain I was suffering, I helped my brother to escape by 
		breaking open the door. I was badly burned in the process. That night, I 
		hid in our backyard pond. Next morning, when I emerged from the pond 
		chunks of flesh started falling off my body. I had no clothes on, except 
		burned shreds to cover some parts. When I looked around, I saw some men 
		from our village returning from their morning prayers. On seeing me they 
		made funny noises and gestures. I tried to tell them I was not a 
		prostitute but so-and-so's daughter, and tried to solicit their help. 
		But they walked away. Since that day I have been a living dead. My body 
		is in pain. I have no status, job, or education. My brother now owns the 
		family business and I live in his house. I gave up my dignity, my life, 
		everything for my brother; but today I am no better than his servant. 
		This is women's lot in Bangladesh.</span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">On April 3, 1971, the Pakistan army 
		came to our town. The Biharis in our railway colony were emboldened. We 
		saw them walking around the place without fear and it made us very 
		angry. I and five other friends, who had joined the Mukti Bahini, 
		decided to punish them. We went to one of our Bihari neighbours' house. 
		I used to call him 'uncle' and his daughter was my sister's friend. She 
		used to refer to me as 'brother'. But that day all human ties were 
		broken.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 28.35pt; margin-right: 28.35pt; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-family: Verdana"><br>
		We forcibly entered the house . . . grabbed the young girl and stripped 
		her naked. She was struck with fear and shame. She ran out of the house 
		and we ran after her. The crowd pursuing her grew in size. I had only 
		one thought in my mind. 'I want to rape and destroy this girl. I want to 
		destroy the Biharis, they are our enemies.' . . . Abdul Hussain (a 
		person I did not like) saw us chasing the girl. He came out of his 
		house, wrapped the girl with a shawl and took her inside. He told the 
		crowd, 'If you want to take this girl, take her over my dead body.' We 
		all stood there. No one had the courage to enter his house and drag her 
		out. At that moment I realized I had become a criminal. The gun they had 
		given me was a tool to kill. They had taught me how to kill. They made 
		me cold like a snake. 'What have I become?', I thought. During the war, 
		I committed many crimes . . . Nationalism is corrupting; I understand it 
		only today.</span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">When I heard this confession from a 
		perpetrator of violence, I was dumbfounded. I had not expected to hear 
		such a story. Even as I listened, confusing and contradictory thoughts 
		and feelings clashed in my mind. I found myself asking: What am I 
		supposed to do? Should I tell him, as I had the victims, that I 
		empathize with his suffering? Do I tell him he is a criminal and 
		deserves the agony of his memory? Should my role as a researcher be 
		predictable, to commiserate with the victims and loathe the 
		perpetrators, even one such as Biman, whose pain, though definitely 
		different from his victim, is deep and troubling. I was confused. 
		Although I could not come up with a resolution to my own troubled 
		thoughts, I understood then, as much as I do now, that what I heard was 
		a voice from the grave, a man damned by his own memories and actions, a 
		lonely, sad figure who cannot talk about his experiences in the war 
		because he is not allowed to reveal and expose the criminal actions 
		behind nation-building and nationalism. </span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">Perpetrators appear in many forms and 
		under many guises  Pakistani, Bengali, Bihari. But there is a common 
		element that binds them within a shared framework. Driven by the spirit 
		of nationalism and nation-building, these men committed horrific crimes 
		that haunt them even today. Pakistani soldiers and their Bihari 
		supporters raped and killed to save a nation; Bengali men also raped and 
		killed in the hope of making a new nation, which they did. Who is 
		guilty? What was the power that transformed ordinary men into criminals? 
		I am not saying we should absolve the rapists and killers, but I am 
		asking who is to blame? I have come to realize from listening to the 
		stories of survivors that we need to move beyond the individual and 
		investigate larger institutions such as the state and the ideology of 
		nationalism that drove the war and used it to aggrandize power. To 
		understand the process and creation of the sovereign power of the state 
		that made citizens into agents for raping, killing, brutalizing, we have 
		to listen to both victims and perpetrators. We would be fools not to 
		listen to what they are saying, because in their stories is the evidence 
		of what happened in the Liberation War, a story that has been 
		suppressed.</span></div>
