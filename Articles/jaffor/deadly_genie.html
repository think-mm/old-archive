  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Century Schoolbook&quot;">Under this back drop when the
  news of Eid day blasts hit the airwaves, Reuters reported in one of their
  dispatches on December 7, 2002, at that was posted in the Yahoo news site at
  12:10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time that Bangladesh’s <b><font color="#000080">Home
  Minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury hinted that according to Bangladesh police
  the attacks could be the work of Osama bin Laden al-Qaeda network.</font></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></b>
  </span>Reading this report we heaved a sigh of relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We thought good sense has finally returned to our politicians’ mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They are now admitting that all is not well in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And they now see the invisible hands of al-Qaeda behind many of the
  bomb blasts that have taken place in the last couple of years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To my knowledge, no self-respecting commentators have mentioned in
  their essays that Osama bin Laden’s organization al-Qaeda is behind all
  these bombings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering which
  places were bombed in Bangladesh, some commentators have opined that perhaps
  some fringe organizations with a strong tie to fundamentalist political
  parties are behind these hate crimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
  when we first read in the Reuters report that Bangladesh’s Home Minister has
  hinted the role of al-Qaeda in these bombings, we felt relieved thinking that
  good sense has finally prevailed amongst the ruling party politicians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, how wrong we were!&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Century Schoolbook&quot;">Within hours of the first
  Reuters report in which the Home Minister’s assertion was published, we read
  the account of denial by the same minister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>On 11:00 a.m., Dec 08, 2002, we saw in the Yahoo news site an AP
  dispatch written by Mr. Farid Hossain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  was titled, “Bangladesh rules out al-Qaida involvement in bombings; toll
  rises to 18.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This time the
  minister said in a news conference, “I ... would like to categorically state
  here that there is no al-Qaida network on the soil of Bangladesh.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Home Minister’s earlier comments did not jibe with the party
  line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Century Schoolbook&quot;">The ruling BNP made an
  alliance with other Islamic fundamentalist parties in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This alliance was made before October 1, 2001, election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>After winning the parliamentary election, the government of Khaleda Zia
  included two powerful ministers from Jamaat-i-Islam party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Also, the BNP is soft on Islamic fundamentalist parties that Bangladesh
  has many operating for years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
  is precisely why whenever any journalists or commentators would bring the
  charge of al-Qaeda or any other rogue Islamic organizations’ complicity in
  minority repression or terrorist activities such as bombing incidents over the
  last 4 years, the government would steadfastly deny those allegations by
  saying that there is no al-Qaeda cell operating inside the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Century Schoolbook&quot;">When Mr. Alex Perry, a
  journalist from for Time Asia magazine wrote an article in October 2002, in
  which he mentioned that Osama bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman Al-Zawahiri,
  has been hiding in the country for many months, the government and other
  sympathetic newspaper editors in Bangladesh condemned Mr. Perry for his
  portrayal of Bangladesh a den of Taliban and al-Qaeda soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Alex Perry, South Asia Bureau Chief, Time magazine, shot back, “We're
  not saying the government is linked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We're
  saying the government simply isn't in control and al-Qaeda and Taleban are
  taking advantage of that.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  Bangladesh Foreign Ministry had denounced Mr. Perry’s report characterizing
  it as a sinister attempt by Time magazine to besmirch the country's secular
  and tolerant reputation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
  this varied backdrop, it was a surprising development that Bangladesh’s Home
  Minister, Mr. Altaf Hossain Chowdhury would now admit that Eid day bombings in
  Mymensingh may be the work of al-Qaeda terrorist group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This would also give credence to the fact that Osama bin Laden’s
  organization al-Qaeda is present in Bangladesh’s soil.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  report published in the Internet, the Home Minister of Bangladesh had to
  retract his words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
  much-publicized news conference, the Home Minister now says something that is
  180 degree opposite to what was hinted immediately after the bomb blast.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><b><font color="#000080">The minister’s earlier comments
  did not jibe with his party line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sadly,

  manmade disaster strikes, the authorities do not make any hasty comments
  without having the facts and figure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Take
  the case of 9-11 incidents that have turned this world of ours a topsy-turvy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Bush Administration only pointed out the involvement of al-Qaeda
  when it was determined that the all the hijackers of 4 commercial airplanes
  were Arabs and some evidences left in the rental car gave credence to the idea
  that the perpetrators of the crime belonged to Osama bin Laden’s hated group
  al-Qaeda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in Bangladesh,
  the PM and her lieutenants are so smart that they hardly need any
  investigative report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
  police are still sifting the debris in the rubles of demolished cinema halls
  to look for clues, the politicians have already found their answers from
  divine sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In unison, they
  said that Bangladesh has no al-Qaeda terrorists; therefore, the linkage
  between al-Qaeda and the rash of these bombings are quite absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What a simplistic thinking!&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook" lang="EN-US">The
  PM of Bangladesh is an avowed Islamist who had performed not one but three
  Umrah Hajj since October 2001.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;
  </span>She has two sworn fundamentalist ministers in her cabinet.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;
  </span>Therefore, it comes as no surprise that immediately after the bombing
  when one of her ministers hinted to the news media that the bombings could the
  work of al-Qaeda, the minister had to retract his statement.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;
  </span>The minister’s comment to media was at variance with the party line.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;
  </span>The flap over the minister's comment had embarrassed the PM and
  something drastic was needed to be done.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;
  </span>Thus, the minister in question had to call a hastily arranged news
  conference in which he simply had to retract his “damaging” statement.<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  however is sticking to theirs original story in which they said that the Home
  Mister thinks that the bombings were the works of al-Qaeda. <span style="mso-spacerun:

  Reuters report that Bangladesh ministers say that the bombings were the work
  of al-Qaeda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ministers also
  opine that the opposition parties are doing this to destabilize the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  comment is far from over even though the minister has retracted his statement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  hours after the four bomb blasts in Mymensingh, we saw a drama unfolding
  centering the blame game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><b>One
  of the powerful ministers of Khaleda Zia remarked that the bombings could be
  the work of Osama bin Laden’s organization al-Qaeda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But then, this statement was deemed very dangerous for Bangladesh
  because the party in power had been saying all along that Bangladesh does not
  have any al-Qaeda cell operation inside the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span></b>At this trying time when American president George Bush had
  declared a war against Osama’s organization al-Qaeda, Bangladesh government
  realizes the consequence of such statement by one of her ministers could be
  very damaging even though it is a much talked about topic amongst the
  intellectuals in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Century Schoolbook&quot;">One simply has to look at the
  bomb victims to realize that this hapless bunch has gone to merry-making on
  Eid day to movie theaters—that are abhorred by fundamentalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>These are undoubtedly the works of Islamic fundamentalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The sooner the government would accept this matter-of-factly
  conclusion, the better it would be to look for ways to stop these menacing
  acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <b>the way the ruling party is trying to muzzle the
  voice of one of their own, it would be light years from now that they would
  admit that some fringes of Islamists are behind all these bombings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Unless this genie is contained in the bottle right away, it may become
  a pernicious force to take the nation of 130 million into abyss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span></b>The government should do something constructive rather than
  arresting some of its critics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let
  good sense prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
