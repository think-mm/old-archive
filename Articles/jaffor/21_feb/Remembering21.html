	<p><font face="Verdana">How quick time passes by!&nbsp; It seems like the bloody the incident of 
	February 21, 1952, just happened few decades earlier.&nbsp; A page from my memory 
	unfolds when I was a little boy growing up in Tejkunipara, Tejgaon, Dacca -- 
	a place just walking distance from Farmgate area of Dhaka.&nbsp; Our neighborhood 
	was only 2 miles north of Dhaka Medical College gate, which was the 
	epicenter of the day’s activity on February 21, 1952.&nbsp; But it was a tranquil 
	day where I lived as far as I could tell.&nbsp; At the time no one thought that 
	the day’s activity would shape up the lives of millions of people even half 
	a century later. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><i>Ekushey February</i> did not happen just like that.&nbsp; Four and a half 
	year before bullets was pumped into the body of some protesters who were 
	shouting &quot;<i>Rashtro-Bhasha – Bangla Cai</i>&quot; near the gate of Dhaka Medical 
	College a new nation was created by Mohammad Ali Jinnah and his followers 
	belonging to The Muslim League of India.&nbsp; Mr. Jinnah wanted the new nation 
	Pakistan to be a secular Muslim country and not an Islamic one.&nbsp; However, in 
	the post-Jinnah days, the rulers of Pakistan in Karachi had other ideas.&nbsp; 
	The new nation was being governed by a constitution essentially handed down 
	by the British.&nbsp; The name of the new nation was &quot;Republic of Pakistan.&quot;&nbsp; 
	Nonetheless, some &quot;bright folks&quot; in Karachi had other ideas in their mind.&nbsp; 
	They were working on a new constitution for this new nation.&nbsp; The blueprint 
	of that constitution was worked out even before Pakistan was carved out of 
	India on August 14, 1947.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Jinnah only lived 13 months after the 
	day Pakistan came into being.&nbsp; To fill the Governor General’s position, the 
	Muslim Leaguers chose Dhaka Nawab Bari’s scion Khwaja Nazimuddin while 
	Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan who migrated from Karnal district of East Punjab 
	remained as the Prime Minister of Pakistan.&nbsp; Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan was then 
	gun downed by a military clique on October 16, 1951, who did not like the 
	soft approach Liaquat Ali had adopted to settle the Kashmir issue with the 
	Indians.&nbsp; After the assassination of Liaquat Ali, Khawaja Nazimuddin was 
	removed from the position of the Governor General by the work of a Muslim 
	League clique headed by the ex-Finance Minister Mr. Ghulam Mohammad, a 
	Punjabi accountant and an ex-bureaucrat.&nbsp; Mr. Ghulam Mohammad then ascended 
	to the supreme power of the Governor General of Pakistan, which was the most 
	powerful position according to the constitution adopted in August 1947.&nbsp; In 
	just over four-years after Pakistan was formed an evil Punjabi clique took 
	control of Pakistan.&nbsp; Incidentally, Khawaja Nazimuddin was sacked by Ghulam 
	Mohammad in April 1953.&nbsp; There went the dream of any Bengali to be in the 
	limelight in Pakistani politics in Karachi.&nbsp; There is a good reason for 
	bringing this clouded early history of Pakistan while I discuss the incident 
	of gunning down of students on February 21, 1952, outside the front gate of 
	Dhaka Medical College. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When police fired on agitated but unarmed students, who were protesting 
	against the status of Urdu being the only state language of Pakistan, the 
	bureaucrat turn politician Ghulam Mohammad was the chief executive of 
	Pakistan being the Governor General.&nbsp; Dhaka’s own Khawaja Nazimuddin was the 
	Prime Minister and the Pakistan Muslim League was managing the nation with a 
	stiff hand.&nbsp; In the province of East Bengal, which later was named East 
	Pakistan after march 23, 1956, too, the Muslim League was in firm control.&nbsp; 
	One local politician by the name <b>Nurul Amin </b>who represented the 
	Mymensingh town and the neighboring area was the provincial Chief Minister 
	of East Bengal.&nbsp; Therefore, the entire Muslim League organization of East 
	Bengal and Pakistan took the blame for the police’s heavy-handedness in 
	dealing with the striking students that lead to this bloody incidents of 
	February 21, 1952.&nbsp; At the time, many Bangalee politicians belonging to 
	Awami League and other political parties were rounded up by the government 
	and were sent to jails everywhere in East Bengal.&nbsp; Incidentally, Sheikh 
	Mujib was also locked up in Dhaka’s Central Gaol located on the road named 
	ironically after Khwaja Nazimuddin Road. <br>

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp; 
	</font> 
	<p><font face="Verdana">When some Dhaka University students and some unidentified people (one 
	being a rickshawalla) were killed by the police action, the Chief Minister 
	Mr. Nurul Amin was immediately identified as the chief culprit.&nbsp; Khwaja 
	Nazimuddin was&nbsp; also blamed for the incident.&nbsp; For some strange reason or 
	other, Ghulam Mohammad, the all too powerful Governor General of Pakistan 
	eluded the blame.&nbsp; Perhaps Khwaja Nazimuddin and Nurul Amin were the fall 
	guys who were squarely blamed because they were both Bangalees and the 
	protest for which the students and some innocent folks died were tied up 
	with the language movement.&nbsp; The local vernacular press had an epithet for 
	them; they were both labeled as traitor.&nbsp; The shrewd Punjabi Governor 
	General Ghulam Mohammad took advantage of the chaos being generated in 
	Dhaka.&nbsp; They called it a local problem.&nbsp; Khawaja Nazimuddin was ultimately 
	sacked by the Governor General in April 1953 only to be replaced by another 
	Bangalee stooge of the Karachi oligarchy Mr. Mohammad Ali of Bogra (Bogura 
	district of East Bengal).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That essentially killed the career of Mr. 
	Nazimuddin as a politician, which was started in 1922 when he was elected as 
	the Chairman of Dhaka municipality.&nbsp; This one-time favorite politician of 
	Mr. Jinnah died in 1964. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">A blemished Nurul Amin remained as a pariah Muslim Leaguer throughout the 
	rest of his life.&nbsp; First in 1954 general election, the United Front 
	candidates defeated the Muslim League candidates in a landslide victory.&nbsp; 
	One of the reason is the killing of students on February 21, 1952.&nbsp; The 
	Bangalees of East Bengal never could efface that bloody incident from their 
	mind.&nbsp; Moreover, the cry for &quot;<i>Rashtro Bhasha -- Bangla Cai</i>&quot; remained 
	alive because the Karachi Administration never did come to terms with the 
	Bangalees demand for Bangla as one of the state languages of Pakistan.&nbsp; The 
	defamed Muslim Leaguer Mr. Nurul Amin remained loyal throughout the rest of 
	his life to the cause of united Pakistan so much so that during 1971 when 
	Bangalees’ call for liberation came loud and clear, Mr. Nurul Amin sided 
	with the Pakistani military.&nbsp; He left for Pakistan during the crisis where 
	he remained the rest of his life in infamy.&nbsp; Nurul Amin who ordered the 
	firing of bullets on unarmed students in 1952 will be remembered as a 
	traitor.&nbsp; In the aftermath of February 1952 gunning down of students this 
	scribe as a youngster saw handmade sign &quot;<i>Nurul Amine’r Kolla Cai</i>&quot; 
	(Bring us the head of Nurul Amin!) hanging by the neck of stray dogs near 
	Tejgaon Thana.&nbsp; This brought a whole lot of chuckles among our elders who 
	were solidly behind the ‘<i>Rashtro Bhasha -- Bangla Cai</i>’ movement. 
	</font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The question we should all be asking is the following: Why was this 
	shooting possible on February 21, 1952?&nbsp; The answer to this straight forward 
	question is not that simple.&nbsp; First, there was this Muslim League&nbsp; 
	government in the province of East Bengal that was headed by Nurul Amin.&nbsp; 
	This government would take orders from Karachi, which was also headed by the 
	Pakistan Muslim League.&nbsp; Four years before the incident of February 21st 
	killing of Bhasha Andolon protesters, Mr. Jinnah pronounced in Curzon Hall 
	on March 21, 1948, that &quot;<i>Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language 
	of Pakistan</i>.&quot;&nbsp; He also warned the audience at Curzon Hall by uttering -- 
	&quot;<i>Any one who tries to mislead you is really an enemy of Pakistan</i>.&quot;&nbsp; 
	However, a few backbenchers shot back, &quot;<b>No. No. Never</b>.&quot;&nbsp; Whether 
	Bangla should be one of the state languages of Pakistan or not, was a 
	serious issue in the constituent assembly in Karachi.&nbsp; Every time a 
	legislator by the name Dherendranath Dutta raised this issue to include 
	Bangla as one of the state languages of Pakistan in the assembly, Nawabzada 
	Liaquat Ali and his gang including Khwaja Nazimuddin would vote against it.&nbsp; 
	Our parental and grandfather’s generation knew all about it throughout East 
	Bengal, but what else could they do?&nbsp; The politicians in East Bengal were 
	dominated by the Muslim League of Mr. Jinnah.&nbsp; They were not in a mood to 
	challenge the authority of Messrs. Jinnah, Liaquat Ali, Nazimuddin, and the 
	whole shebang.&nbsp; Therefore, the <i>Bhasha Andolon</i> became the burden of 
	most ordinary folks in Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Khulna, and other urbane 
	areas.&nbsp; The college students took the lead with the tacit approval of their 
	professors.&nbsp; The movement was undeniably an homegrown one; a leaflet there, 
	a wall poster there, and a slogan near the school yard.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; 
	Therefore, when students were protesting in the Dhaka University campus and 
	when they decided to march towards the Provincial Assembly Building locate 
	in Ramna not to far from the DU campus the police created a roadblock near 
	the front gate of Dhaka Medical College.&nbsp; The bloody incident happened 
	because of the stepmotherly attitude of Nurul Amin’s government. </font> </p>

	<p><font face="Verdana">The whole sad episode of Ekushe February could have been averted if there 
	were some sensible politicians among the Muslim Leaguers.&nbsp; We have to 
	remember one thing and that is this Pakistan was created to safeguard the 
	interest of Urdu-speaking elite of U.P. and nearby northwestern Indian 
	states.&nbsp; Bengal was never part of the original Pakistan scheme as propounded 
	by Choudhary Rahmat Ali.&nbsp; I recently found out that the original dreamer of 
	Pakistan had chosen a name of East Bengal, which is <b>
	<font color="#009900">Bang-i-Islam</font> </b>(ref: http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?perid=P008).&nbsp; 
	Even though in united Pakistan a majority spoke Bangla, the ruling U.P. and 
	Punjabi politicians chose Urdu that was spoken by only 12-15% of the total 
	population.&nbsp; The reason for this stepmotherly attitude was that Bangalees 
	did not have a strong voice in Karachi’s constituent assembly.&nbsp; The matter 
	was further complicated by the fact that we had some obsequious Bangalee 
	politicians such as Khawaja Nazimuddin, Bogra’s Mohammad Ali, etc., and sad 
	as it may sound, even Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy was not a champion for the 
	cause of Bangla language.&nbsp; All these negative factors worked against us in 
	the wee hours of Pakistan’s independence.&nbsp; Therefore, the bloodshed became a 
	necessary evil.&nbsp; I feel sorry for those who gave their lives.&nbsp; They would 
	have been in their seventies now had they been alive today.&nbsp; However, 
	because of their supreme sacrifice, the Bangla language became one of the 
	state languages of Pakistan but it took several years after the bloody 
	incident of February 21, 1952. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In the years after 1952, the remembrance and commemoration of <i>Bhasha 
	Dibash</i> used to wear a sad and pallid look.&nbsp; However, by the end of 1960s 
	the <i>Bhasha Dibash</i> had abandoned this sad demeanor and it&nbsp; took a more 
	heroic and jubilant tone.&nbsp; The Bangalees en masse took to the streets in 
	1968 and 1969 to denounce the heavy-handedness of Ayub’s regime dealing with 
	Agartala Conspiracy case.&nbsp; In this constantly evolving world, the 
	celebration of <i>Bhasha Dibash</i> changed it’s relevance.&nbsp; It is no longer 
	a sad chapter of our early struggle against the tyranny of a few who thought 
	they would decide our fate sitting a thousand miles away in Karachi. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I have a mixed feeling about Ekushe February.&nbsp; My heart fills with joy 
	knowing that on that fateful day, in the Bangla month of <i>Falgun</i>, a 
	few brave sons of the soil protested vigorously to make Bangla our <i>
	Rashtro Bhasha</i> and they took some bullets, which was the sad part.&nbsp; 
	Blood was spilled in the perched and dusty soil in front of Dhaka Medical 
	College gate.&nbsp; In return we got our voice back.&nbsp; The politicians in Karachi 
	learned their lesson well.&nbsp; Come to think of it, the Bangla month of <i>
	Falgun</i> is a time when new buds sprout.&nbsp; Similarly, the sacrifice of a 
	few brave sons of the soil heralded a new beginning.&nbsp; We broke the manacles 
	of tyranny.&nbsp; No wonder, this secular celebration is one of the most 
	cherished one in Bangladesh.&nbsp; You look everywhere and what you see is the 
	reaffirmation of our victory on <i>Ekushey </i>February, 1952.&nbsp; Also, it is 
	a small wonder that this sacrifice by the few Bangalees half a century ago 
	smothered the nation affectionately with the name <i>Ekushe</i> no matter 
	whether it is a TV station or a Book Fair. </font> </p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Let the memory of that supreme sacrifice of a few brave sons of the soil 
	linger in the minds of millions of folks living in the deltaic land of 
	Bangladesh.&nbsp; <i>Bangla Bhasha’r Joi Houk</i>!&nbsp; (Long Live Bangla language).
