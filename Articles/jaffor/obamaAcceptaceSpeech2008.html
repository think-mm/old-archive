	&nbsp;</div>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unless you’ve been in Mars you may 
	have noticed that the news media, Internet, TV channels are all abuzz with 
	the news of Democratic Convention that is taking place in Denver, Colorado 
	from August 25th through 28th. The convention delegates are all gathered 
	here to energize the “base,” which was fractured by a very divisive primary 
	elections that took place starting from late January 2008 through the first 
	week of June 2008. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The primaries in which Barack Obama 
	and Hillary Clinton fought tooth and nail to get enough delegates to win the 
	nomination had created a chasm between Obama and Clinton supporters. Among 
	the Democrats and Independents, a coalition of young college going students, 
	educated and professionals, African Americans have overwhelmingly supported 
	Senator Obama while a coalition of women, less educated White men, and 
	Hispanics have thrown their support for Hillary Clinton. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the last four decades, we have 
	not seen such a hotly contested primaries in America in which the two 
	candidates fought very hard to win the primaries. Normally, by Super Tuesday 
	(the first Tuesday in February) when primaries are held in many states it 
	becomes very clear who will be the nominee for Democratic Party. But not in 
	2008. During the prolong and brutal primary season both the Clinton and 
	Obama campaigns hurled enough negativities to plant a seed of distrust in 
	the minds of millions of supporters. Therefore, a wedge had developed 
	between the two camps. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From June through August 2008, the 
	bigwigs of the party tried to smooth out the differences that exist in the 
	hearts and minds of both Barack and Hillary supporters so that in the Denver 
	convention the party will not only be unified but energized at the same 
	time. For, it is absolutely essential to have a united front to launch a 
	vigorous campaign to elect the party’s nominee on November 4, 2008. If there 
	is a semblance of a divided party coming out of the convention, the 
	Democrats could kiss goodbye to a possible win in November. Therefore, as 
	the convention got underway, there were intense negotiations to cajole 
	hostile delegates supporting Senator Clinton so that the “base” is unified 
	and un-fractured. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the second day of the convention, 
	Senator Clinton gave an emotional speech in which she implored her 
	supporters to stand behind Barack Obama so that the Party could recapture 
	the White House and a fellow Democrat take charge of the nation in the last 
	week of January 2009. The Clintons were jubilant on August 26, 2008. Bill 
	Clinton who became a controversial politician during the primaries when he 
	made some harsh remarks against Senator Obama was shown in the “Clinton 
	Booth” smiling profusely and mingling with the delegates. Senator Clinton 
	was introduced to the delegates by her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. And Mrs. 
	Clinton delivered a fiery speech to energize the “base.” She wholeheartedly 
	supported the candidacy of Barack Obama when she gave the clarion call for 
	electing the senator from Illinois. She called Obama “my candidate” and she 
	added, “He must be our president.” It was a passionate call to recapture the 
	White House. She however profusely talked about herself and her campaign to 
	energize her base but at the end of her speech she beseeched her supporters 
	to join the campaign for a possible victory in the upcoming election. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">President Bill Clinton also 
	addressed the convention on the third day (August 27, 2008) and he also gave 
	a conciliatory speech. Like Hillary Clinton, he also gave a call for unified 
	“Base” without whose support Obama will not be able to defeat the Republican 
	challenger, Senator John McCain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is worth mentioning here that 
	Bill Clinton still has many followers especially among rural Democrats 
	mostly men in Appalachian mountain region in the Midwest and northeast. To 
	win such states as Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Obama needs the support of 
	those less educated male voters. Thus, strengthening the “base” by a fiery 
	and emotional speech from Bill Clinton had forged a united front. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have noticed that McCain campaign 
	had aired quite a few TV Ads directed towards Clinton supporters as the 
	convention went underway. In the past, no Republican hopefuls had ever 
	televised any political advertisement as democrats staged their convention. 
	Therefore, it seems as if the election season will be hyper-charged and a 
	nasty one. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many Democrats now believe in the 
	‘tit-for-tat’ policy. When the Republicans would meet in Minneapolis in the 
	first week of September 2008 to coronate John McCain as the party's 
	flag-bearer, be sure about the negative TV Ads to hit the airwaves, which 
	will be produced by the Obama campaign. The Democrats are learning very fast 
	that to be a nice guy would mean a possible loss in the presidential 
	contest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1988, George H. W. Bush’s 
	campaign made some nasty negative Ads to undermine the Democratic candidate, 
	Gov. Michael Dukakis. The most notable among them was the one in which Black 
	inmates were paraded inside a penitentiary while the announcer said that 
	Governor Dukakis had pardoned a convicted felon by the name Willy Horton, an 
	African American, who committed a serious crime such as rape and murder. The 
	bottom line of the Ad - Michael Dukakis was soft on crime. This utterly 
	negative Ad did Dukakis in. Since then the Republicans resorted to negative 
	campaign in each and every presidential race. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And this year is no exception. 
	Senator McCain’s campaign is now onto sticking a label on Obama. They 
	contend that Obama is a narcissist celebrity of mega proportion. Thus, when 
	Obama campaign decided to host the acceptance speech at INVESCO Stadium in 
	the presence of about 80,000 screaming fans, which has never been done 
	before, the Republican talking heads in the media including Karl Rove at the 
	Fox news became very excited because now they could surely give a spin to 
	Obama’s historic acceptance speech to characterize the event as yet another 
	publicity stunt for the “World Class Celebrity”. The McCain campaign will 
	pronounce that Obama being a narcissist only cares about him rather than the 
	common people of America. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I mentioned earlier, on August 
	27, the third day of the Democratic Convention in Denver, Colorado, Bill 
	Clinton gave an electrifying speech in which he endorsed Obama’s candidacy 
	in no uncertain term. Needless to say, both Hillary's and his speech had 
	unified the “base” and tens and thousands of the energized foot soldiers of 
	Democratic Party will now return to their hometowns all across America and 
	do the needful to put their candidate in the White House. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most successful convention in 
	Denver was a stunning one as per all the analysts in CNN news. It was a 
	fault-free and near-perfect convention with full of surprises. Contrary to 
	the belief held by many Republican analysts, the Democrats have ironed out 
	the differences between the two opposing camps of Clinton and Obama. The 
	frictions which kept the two camps apart is now all but vanished into the 
	thin air. Both Senator Clinton and President Clinton will hit the campaign 
	trail in the next 90 days. This positive development in Denver will surely 
	give John McCain and his associates a reason for concern. It remains to be 
	seen how the Republicans conduct their affair in Minneapolis-St. Paul when 
	they anoint John McCain to be their party's flag-bearer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>A post script.</b> I was 
	privileged to view the last day of the convention. The venue was INVESCO 
	sports arena. Obama stood before a crowd of 80,000 to deliver a 
	<a href="#Acceptance_Speech">historic 
	speech</a>, which lasted more than 50 minutes and the attendees were spellbound. 
	Many of the Hillary supporters were in tears hearing Obama’s speech in which 
	he said that he wants to unify the divided nation. Some political analysts 
	in CNN has said that McCain will have difficulty matching the oration of 
	Obama when the former will give the acceptance speech before few thousands 
	cheering Republicans. </font></p>
