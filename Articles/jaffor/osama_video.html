  strongly worded messages for President Bush and Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The timing of the videotaped message could not have been better.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Osama is a publicity seeker par excellence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

  is an oblique reference to September 11 downing of the twin tower complex.<o:p>

  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Osama
  knows very well that he and his terror organization, al-Qaeda, has become an
  election issue and his name was mentioned in all three televised debates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Manhattan</span></st1:place>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Osama’s

  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> government officials warned in a new
  bulletin that urges state and local authorities to be extra vigilant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Throughout the summer months when both the Democrats and Republicans
  were holding their convention, we read the news of public discussion by top
  Bush administration officials about the seriousness of a potential threat to
  disrupt the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On late
  Friday (October 29, 2004) after the news of the bin Laden’s tape was made
  public, the FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a warning by stating:
  “We remain concerned about al-Qaeda’s interest in attacking the American
  homeland, and we cannot discount the possibility that the video may be
  intended to promote violence or serve as a signal for an attack.” <o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The warning bulletin from
  the Homeland Security Department went to their advisers; federal, state and
  local law enforcement; and select members of private industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The government apparently took steps to secure the public and that
  homeland security officials have been urged to keep vigilant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We have learned that in the videotape including portions net yet
  broadcast there was no overt threat and no specific timetable or method given
  for an attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:country-region>

  government officer who watched the entire tape said that much of what has not

  former President George H.W. Bush.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  even criticizes George Bush’s economic and jobs programs and asserted that

  <p style="line-height:15.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Osama’s
  videotaped message 100 hours before the Election Day has caused political
  angst in both the candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 7.5pt; color: black">Both
  Mr. Bush and Kerry responded with dignified statements of unity against Osama
  and his terror organization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
  the two campaigns struggled to figure out how such a ghastly event would alter
  Tuesday's (Nov. 2) outcome.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Senator
  Kerry did not waste time once he was aware of the Osama Tape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He sternly said, “Let me make it clear, crystal clear: As Americans,
  we are absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy Osama
  bin Laden and the terrorists.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
  tough talk by Kerry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
  President Bush spoke his mind; he said, “Let me make this very clear:
  Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I’m sure Senator Kerry agrees with this.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:15.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 7.5pt; color: black">However,
  even as the candidates uttered seasoned politician-like phrases, their
  advisers and allies were busy as ever to spin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Richard C. Holbrooke, a foreign policy adviser for Kerry, said on CNN
  that the tape was a reminder that Kerry would be more aggressive in pursuing
  bin Laden.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Holbrooke remarked,
  “How can this grotesque mass murderer be out there on worldwide television
  more than three years after 9/11?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
  haven’t we captured him, if the Bush administration was going to be so
  effective in the war on terror?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

  spin masters are at it now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like
  his democratic counterparts John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker J.
  Dennis Hastert (Republican-Illinois), said bin Laden’s statement might help
  Bush.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“You really want a strong
  leader.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So it plays well for the
  president.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeff Bell, Bush’s
  campaign strategist said, “If you've got Osama back on the scene talking
  about 9/11 but not making an attack, it could be the best of both worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It's good for Bush, the fact that [bin Laden] hasn’t been able to
  attack, except for verbally.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:15.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 7.5pt; color: black">Senator
  Kerry’s aides appeared visibly alarmed while they were airborne in a plane
  as they planned a response to bin Laden’s tape airing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One prominent Democrat who was in the plane thought that for swing
  voters, who have not followed the election closely, bin Laden's reappearance
  may well boost Bush.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You can see
  that bin Laden’s videotaped message had took swipe at both the campaigns of
  Bush and Kerry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one can deny
  that Osama is a shrewd jihadi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
  is even a hint in the message that Osama has viewed Michael Moore’s
  documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” because there was this oblique reference to
  Bush’s reading of story books to school children on September 11, 2001, in
  Florida in Laden’s message.<o:p>

  the rest of us, I think this will rapidly become another reminder of his

  Osama looked quite sharp in the recent video.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This brought the following remarks in the Zogby International’s
  website: “While it is undoubtedly true that Osama would have dolled himself
  up before going on camera (I can't quite imagine Osama bin Laden with a makeup
  artist, a producer, and whatnot....the mixture of imagery between an Islamic
  fundamentalist and some Mary Kay cosmetic ladies doesn't mesh in my brain),
  there is only so much that anyone could cover-up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>More to the point, I'm pretty sure that those sort of makeup type
  resources would likely be fairly Spartan wherever he shot that video--although
