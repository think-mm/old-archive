  December 7, 2004, I was able to attend a seminar at the center where I work on 
  the use of adult stem cell to cure a variety of human maladies.&nbsp; Prof. Brian 
  T. Butcher of 'Center for Gene Therapy' of Tulane University, New Orleans, was 
  the seminar speaker.&nbsp; The professor gave a half-an hour technical talk on the 
  promise and pledge of adult stem cell and its usage in repairing human tissue 
  damage, which was followed by an intense half-an hour question-answer 
  session.&nbsp; I learned a lot about a field that is growing by leaps and bounds in 
  the last few years.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b>
  What is a stem cell?</b>&nbsp; These are specialized and undifferentiated cells 
  present in embryonic tissue (embryonic stem cells) and in bone marrow (adult 
  stem cells).&nbsp; The reasons stem cells are getting attention from scientific 
  communities allover the world are as follows: stem cells can help make a 
  particular type of cells.&nbsp; In other words, they have the potential to make a 
  specific cell such as lung cells, heart muscle cells, brain cells, spinal 
  chord tissue cells, etc.&nbsp; After birth, in human body all we have is 
  differentiated cells.&nbsp; Lungs have lung cells, brain has brain cells, and 
  pancreas has pancreatic cells, so on, and so forth.&nbsp; The pancreatic cells have 
  lost their power to make lungs cells or epithelial cells, and for that matter, 
  no other cells.&nbsp; That is the reason when spinal cord injury happens due to 
  accident, the spinal cord tissue being a differentiated cells do not have the 
  power to regenerate spinal cord cells.&nbsp; That is precisely why a person with 
  spinal cord injury never recovers fully from the injury.&nbsp; The plight of 
  Hollywood actor Christopher Reeve, who brought a comic book hero to life in 
  four Superman movies and who became a real-life crusader for medical 
  research after a paralyzing, near-fatal horseback-riding accident, had to 
  endure so much.&nbsp; His condition after the accident never did improve much and 
  he died on October 10, 2004.&nbsp; Had there been a procedure to develop stem cell 
  therapy, the doctors would have injected stem cells in his damaged tissue, 
  spinal cord regeneration would have occurred, his condition would have gotten 
  better.&nbsp; In principle, the stem cells when injected into the damage spinal 
  cord would have started new cell growth in spinal cord and the damaged tissue 
  could have been repaired by stem cells.&nbsp; That is the reason clinical 
  physicians, scientists, etc., are all interested in stem cells because they 
  can repair the damage of the injured tissues in a human body.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
  Technically, stem cells can be injected to a heart muscle right after a heart 
  attack to repair the heart tissue damage.&nbsp; I learned from the seminar that 
  this is now being done as an experimental therapeutics.&nbsp; As more knowledge is 
  gained, who knows probably in the next 10-12 years from now stem cell mediated 
  tissue repair will become available in the West as an experimental therapy.&nbsp; 
  Eventually the art of repairing various damaged tissues through stem cells 
  will become routine in years to come.&nbsp; Someday this new procedure will make 
  its way to least developed nations on earth and many people round the world 
  will be benefited by the marvels of stem cell research. </span></p>

  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">In 
  a way of introduction Prof. Brian Butcher of Tulane University showed the 
  picture of a young boy who suffered from a rare bone disease in which the 
  patients bone are not dense enough; therefore, the patients bone is very 
  brittle.&nbsp; Children who are afflicted with this rare disease cannot stand or 
  walk because of the brittle nature of the bone.&nbsp; By injecting adult stem cells 
  the Tulane Team and St. Jude Hospital in Memphis were able to induce bone 
  growth in a patient by injecting adult stem cells.&nbsp; The results of this 
  experimental therapy were simply amazing.&nbsp; The patient who has this bone 
  disease usually dies early.&nbsp; Who knows, by this stem cell therapy, the patient 
  may increase their bone density and live a little longer?&nbsp; Such is the promise 
  of stem cell therapy.</span></p>

  Prof. Brian Butcher showed us a list of diseases where stem cell research may 
  help find a cure.&nbsp; Spinal cord injury is one of the damage that could be cured 
  by stem cells.&nbsp; The diabetic patient may get a shot of stem cells in the 
  pancreas, which then may make millions of beta cells to produce insulin and 
  thereby cure the disease for once and all.&nbsp; No more injection of insulin every 
  day!&nbsp; In the same vein, a stroke victim may get a dose of stem cells in the 
  brain so that the damaged tissue there could regenerate and repair itself.&nbsp; 
  The possibilities of stem cell-mediated therapy are endless.&nbsp; No wonder that 
  stem cells research had caught the fancy of medical and life scientists 
  allover the globe.</span></p>

  From the seminar that I had attended on December 7, 2004, I also learned how 
  to grow and purify adult stem cells.&nbsp; Medical scientists can extract stem 
  cells from the bone morrow from a donor.&nbsp; From the two hips, doctors could 
  extract bone marrow, usually a few cubic centimeters, after a localized 
  anesthesia is given in the hips and drill a minute hole in it.&nbsp; It is a simple 
  procedure.&nbsp; The bone marrow cells are then treated according to a protocol and 
  then separated by a centrifuge to separate the stem cells from other 
  contaminating cells.&nbsp; Finally, the purified stem cells are grown in the 
  laboratory for few days to increase their mass.&nbsp; These stem cells are then 
  harvested and concentrated, which will then be ready for injecting into the 
  diseased tissue.&nbsp; The doctors will have to determine carefully the dose; after 
  injecting the cells, the doctors would look for regeneration of the tissue.&nbsp; 
  If the new tissue develops, then the disease will be cured.&nbsp; Of course, there 
  is more to it then what I am describing here.&nbsp; However, the readers will get 
  the idea what the therapy entails. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Dr. 
  Brian Butcher told us at the seminar that by injecting adult stem cells in 
  damaged spinal cord the patient may regenerate the tissue and then regain the 
  ability to stand up, which otherwise is not possible.&nbsp; What I gathered is the 
  following: the stem cell research is opening a new door of opportunity for the 
  medical scientists to cure a myriad of diseases.&nbsp; Going into the future, there 
  will be a hope for dismal accident victims, diabetic patients, heart attack 
  victims, stroke victims, emphysema victims, people suffering from nervous 
  disorders, and many more.&nbsp; Think about the stem cells as a new brand of 
  medical arsenals.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
  During the question-answer session, I asked Fr. Butcher whether would it be 
  possible to purify the growth factors or chemical signals that are there in 
  the stem cells that would trigger new tissue-specific growth.&nbsp; My suggestion 
  was that why inject the stem cells when we could inject the specific chemical 
  (peptide, protein, hormone, growth factor, etc.) for each tissue.&nbsp; Jokingly, 
  he asked me to undertake the research.&nbsp; However, he concurred with me that 
  that should be the ultimate goal of medical research.&nbsp; We should understand 
  that stem cells being undifferentiated cells have the ability to induce new 
  tissue-specific cell growth because it contains specific growth factors.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Dr. 
  Brian Butcher also said that embryonic stem cells are more potent in inducing 
  the growth of cells but 25% of the stem cells may turn cancerous.&nbsp; He said he 
  wouldnt mind receiving adult stem cells but not the embryonic one because of 
  the inherent danger.&nbsp; Medical scientists would like to do more research with 
  embryonic stem cells but in the U.S. the devout Christians are dead against 
  the research for the fear that the demand for embryonic stem cells may spur 
  harvesting human embryo, which the fundamentalist Christians oppose because of 
  morale ground.&nbsp; These Christians have influenced President George Bush and 
  other Republican legislators in Washington DC banning embryonic stem cell 
  research in America.&nbsp; These Christians will not object to adult stem cell 
  research, which has the same ability as the embryonic ones to induce new 
  tissue growth albeit with a weak potency.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">For 
  those of the readers who would like to know more about stem cells from 
  technical perspective, I culled more information on both embryonic and adult 
  stem cells by searching some scientific literature.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I have mentioned 
  in my article the future of stem cells (SC) lie in tissue repair, replacement, 
  and regeneration.&nbsp; Stem cells are unspecialized precursor or primordial cells 
  that have the unique ability to self-renew and generate additional stem cells 
  as well as to differentiate into various progenitor cells in response to 
  appropriate signals such tissue damage.&nbsp; These fantastic properties of SC have 
  led researchers to explore new strategies for damaged tissue repair, 
  replacement, and regeneration.&nbsp; Cell Biologists classify SC as either 
  embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or adult stem cells (ASCs), which are 
  tissue-specific.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
  ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos and are 
  considered the most pluripotent stem cell population.&nbsp; These cells (ESCs) can 
  undergo both infinite and undifferentiated proliferation in vitro and can also 
  differentiate into a wide variety of somatic and extra-embryonic tissues.&nbsp; 
  Conversely, ASCs or adult stem cells are unspecialized cells found in 
  differentiated tissues that can self-renew and differentiate into mature cell 
  types of the specific tissue.&nbsp; While ESCs can proliferate forever, the ASCs 
  can proliferate for a limited number of cycles and their healing power 
  (response to differentiation signals) decline with each cell cycle.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For tissue 
  regeneration (read therapy), a major emphasis is placed on controlled 
  differentiation of stem cells into a desired cell or tissue type.&nbsp; Molecular 
  cell biologists have recognized that several growth and differentiation 
  factors are the key to shaping the destiny of stem cells.&nbsp; For example, TGF-&#946; 
  family members are shown to have a pronounced effect on the differentiation of 
  ESCs and neural crest stem cells.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite the fact 
  that the pluripotent ESCs have an added advantage over ASCs, ethical debates 
  have restricted research on ESCs.&nbsp; Because of this, many researchers have gone 
  into research with ASCs.&nbsp; Consequently, some advances have been made in the 
  isolation and characterization of adult stem cells.&nbsp; In adult, hematopoietic 
  (blood forming) stem cells (HSCs) are shown now to proliferate and 
  differentiate throughout the life cycle to produce lymphoid and myeloid cell 
  types.&nbsp; Researchers have shown in the laboratory that Interleukin-3 and 6, 
  thrombopoietin, stem cell factor (SCF), and Flt-3 Ligand could induce blood 
  formation.&nbsp; As I have mentioned earlier in my article, bone marrow-derived 
  stem cells are shown to differentiate into various cell types, including 
  adipocytes (fat cells), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), osteocytes (bone 
  cells), hepatocytes (liver cells), and cardiomycetes (heart muscle cells).&nbsp; 
  Similarly, in the nervous system, the plastic property of neural stem cells 
  has been exploited to regenerate neural tissue damaged by either injury or 
  neuro-degenerative diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
  What lies ahead for stem cell research?&nbsp; The ultimate goal in present-day 
  medical research dealing with tissue regeneration is to figure out the growth 
  or chemical factors that can induce tissue-specific growth.&nbsp; Once that is 
  elucidated, then, we do not have to harvest embryonic stem cells anymore.&nbsp; The 
  tissue-specific growth factor will be farmed in a laboratory by recombinant 
  DNA technology.&nbsp; Who knew 40-50 years ago that insulin, which used to be 
  harvested from bovine (cow) or pig pancreas in a slaughterhouse, would be made 
  inside bacteria by recombinant DNA methodology?&nbsp; Millions of diabetic patients 
  around the world take insulin everyday but most people do not know that human 
  insulin is made inside a bacteria.&nbsp; The same could happen to human growth 
  factors, which is now only available in stem cells.&nbsp; It will be a mistake of 
  giant proportion to block stem cell research.&nbsp; The Christians may block it in 
  America but there will be many other nations where medical scientists will 
  perform research to unlock the mystery of stem cells.&nbsp; One thing is for sure 
  now.&nbsp; We will hear more medical reports in both respected journals and popular 
  press the results of therapeutic studies involving adult stem cells.&nbsp; This new 
  method of curing damaged tissue by stem cells will revolutionize the field of 
  reconstructive surgery, cardiac, diabetic, and other discipline of medical 
  field.&nbsp; All of this will be possible because a handful of rational minds have 
  decided to perform research in the last decade on stem cell.&nbsp; Future belongs 
  to stem cell and that is not an understatement either!</span></p>
