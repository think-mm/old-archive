		<font face="Arial" size="2">
		&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana"><p align="justify">How shameful is it 
		that a great philanderer like Ayub Khan had the audacity to chastise the 
		entire Bengali nation in his second book for not preserving the Muslim 
		culture? The late military general was a walking contradiction in many 
		ways. As he exuded the zeal for Islam, quietly he connived to deprive 
		the Bangalees and that was not all – he also went on to woo the British 
		call girl, Ms. Christine Keeler. Wasn’t he a playboy of the Eastern 
		world? </p>
		<p align="justify">General Ayub Khan, the first military despot who 
		squashed democracy in October 1958, is known for making outrageous 
		comments. His loath for Bengali people was widely known when he was the 
		president of Pakistan. He looked at the masses of erstwhile East 
		Pakistan with nothing but contempt. A handful of East Pakistani Muslim 
		League leaders such as F.K. Chowdhury, Sabur Khan, Monem Khan, Moulvi 
		Tamizuddin, and academicians such as Dr. M.O. Ghani, Dr. M.N. Huda, Dr. 
		Golam W. Chowdhury, Dr. Sajjad Hussain, Dr. S.D. Chowdhury etc. were too 
		obsequious and fawning in their attitude to their master and as such 
		they remained reticent throughout the 1960s when the great Khan made his 
		outlandish comments laced with diatribes against the Bengali people and 
		their great heritage. </p>
		<p align="justify">Ayub Khan being groomed at military academy in his 
		youth had not studied the great culture of Eastern India (Maghad’s Gupta 
		dynasty) that was based in Pataliputra nearly two thousand years ago. 
		Similarly, his shallow understanding of linguistics of India including 
		Bengali led him to pass remarks that are completely wrong but were often 
		riddled with fanaticism. Ayub was a Hindu-hater – pure and simple and an 
		unabashed one. Thus, in his eye Bengalis were trying to revert back to 
		Hinduism. The only folks who protested to Ayub during 1960s were Awami 
		League leaders including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a handful of professors 
		from Dhaka University and literary personalities of East Pakistan such 
		as Begum Sufia Kamal. </p>
		<p align="justify">Why all of a sudden the ghost of Ayub Khan is 
		resurfacing the news media after thirty-three years of his death in 
		1974? Incidentally, Ayub died at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA after 
		being ill for few years. </p>
		<p align="justify">Recently, Ayub Khan’s second book entitled “Dairies 
		of Field Marshall Mohammad Ayub Khan: 1966-72” was posthumously 
		published. I have not read the book from cover to cover but read some of 
		the excerpts, which were published in the media. Ayub’s disdain and 
		execration for Bangalees came out openly through his pen. His myopic 
		mind could never fathom out the rich culture and history of Bengal; 
		therefore, all he saw was the domination by Brahmins over huddled masses 
		of eastern Bengal. He wrongly thought that his countrymen from eastern 
		wing should have embraced the Urdu culture of Uttar Pradesh and Karachi 
		(thanks to Muhajirs from UP and Punjab!) to become a pucca Pakistanis, 
		which we Bengalis never did and the idea was fraught with abhorrence 
		allover eastern Bengal. Ayub Khan was living in the past for in 1930s 
		and early 1940s the idea that Bengali Muslims should forgo their mother 
		tongue, Bangla, and learn Urdu to steep in Muslim culture was gaining 
		strength in certain quarters. It was a few brave souls such as Bengali 
		linguist Dr. Shahidullah who pooh-poohed the idea in late 1940s; his 
		best advice was – leave Bengalis mother tongue alone. Ayub Khan’s 
		comments that he made during 1960s vis-à-vis Bangalee people of East 
		Pakistan regarding their love for their mother tongue and the sacrifice 
		that they made in 1952 will paint a bleak picture of this military man 
		who went to Sandhurst, U.K. in his youth to become a man in uniform. 
		Granted that he learned the art of warfare but sadly he remained 
		uneducated as far as culture and history of Indian subcontinent. </p>
		<p align="justify">On June 24, 2007 Dhaka’s New Age published an article 
		entitled “Ayub Khan hated ‘crooked’ Bengalis.” Reading the article I 
		first learned that Ayub’s second book being published. Ayub’s 
		unsubstantiated claim had drawn criticism from many quarters. His 
		one-sided view on Bangladesh’s liberation war, which crushed Jinnah’s 
		Two-Nations Theory, tells us that he was vexed greatly because of the 
		defeat of Pakistani army in the hands of Indian soldiers and Mukti 
		Bahini fighters. He very conveniently found fault with everyone 
		excepting Pakistani military establishment for this ignominy. He thought 
		three parties, the ‘crooked’ Bengalis, the ‘devious’ Indians, and the 
		‘unreliable’ Americans have done the Pakistani military in. He wrongly 
		thought that Bengalis should not have seceded from Pakistan, the Indians 
		should not have aided the Bengalis, and Americans should not have their 
		hands-off policy. </p>
		<p align="justify">Ayub Khan took control of Pakistan through a 
		cantonment intrigue in October 1958 through which he ousted Maj. Gen. 
		Iskander Mirza, a Bengali army officer turned politician who was the 
		president of Pakistan at the time. He later instituted a homegrown 
		version of democracy through which he ruled Pakistan until March 1969 
		when General Yahya Khan grabbed the power through a coup d'état. Ayub’s 
		policy was outright hostile to East Pakistanis who saw the western wing 
		of Pakistan flourish agriculturally, industrially, and industrially at 
		their expense. For example, the entire output of Chittagong paper mill 
		used to be sent to West Pakistan and a portion of which would return to 
		East and by that time the price of the paper would be jacked up. Such 
		was the step motherly attitude of the Pakistanis. During Ayub’s time 
		many of the canals in Punjab were dug to make the province a granary 
		while no dredging activity was put in place in East Pakistan to lessen 
		the damaging effect of recurring flood which would come every year 
		during monsoon time. It was Ayub’s myopic and vindictive policy that 
		exacerbated the declining agricultural output of the eastern wing of 
		Pakistan. The economic disparity between the two Pakistans was growing 
		so much so that many intellectuals of East Pakistan had convinced the 
		politicians especially Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of Awami League to fight 
		for the fair share of the national wealth of Pakistan. Needless to say, 
		this is the fight that did Pakistan in few years later in 1971. By then, 
		Ayub was long gone from catbird seat of power in Rawalpindi and like 
		ordinary citizens of Pakistan he too witnessed the breakup of his 
		motherland. </p>
		<p align="justify">In his second book Ayub Khan blamed everyone 
		excepting him for the breakup of Pakistan. He thought Zulfikar Ali 
		Bhutto was a conniving politician but he failed to apportion the blame 
		to Pakistani military. He also thought that Gen. Yahya Khan was a weak 
		military leader. </p>
		<p align="justify">Gen. Ayub Khan took pride in being a pucca Muslim and 
		he blamed the Bengalis for not choosing Urdu as the only national 
		language of Pakistan. He erroneously thought that the Bengalis refusal 
		to accept to adopt an alien culture from UP and Karachi, which was 
		solely Urdu-based, had made them a tad closer to Urdu because Bengali 
		language was derived from Sanskrit. </p>
		<p align="justify">Let us investigate a little to see how much of a 
		Muslim he was. It is true that we never saw even once the photo of his 
		wife in the newspaper but was that a proof that he was a good Muslim?
		</p>
		<p align="justify">In early 1960s (probably in 1961 or 1962) while 
		attending the commonwealth conference in London Ayub Khan met the 
		English call girl, Ms. Christine Keeler, who also had a dangerous 
		liaison with British Minister of War, John Profumo. The picture of Ms. 
		Keeler embracing Ayub Khan from while swimming in a pool was widely 
		publicized in London’s newspapers. Gen. Ayub was a famous philanderer 
		and lady’s man and the fact was known to his closely knit group of 
		friends. And here is this man had no qualms chastising the entire 
		Bengalis of East Pakistan for not being a good Muslim! General Ayub Khan 
		was a quintessence of evil as far as Bengalis of East Pakistan was 
		concerned. Through his second book he wanted to wallow in 
		self-righteousness when the facts are other way around. His interminable 
		diatribe against Bengali nation and its political leadership goes to 
		show that he was a flippant human being. Ayub is long gone but it seems 
		as if his ghost is here to stay in South Asia forever.</p>
