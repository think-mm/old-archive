  <p><font face="verdana">In the post 9-11 era, everyone’s mind is focused on
  global terrorism for good reasons. For one thing, America is now fretting for
  more than ever over the possibility of al-Qaeda again attacking their soil.
  The year 2004 is very important for America. The nation is gearing up for a
  presidential election. Therefore, America does not want any terrorist attack
  lest it disrupts the election process. The rest of the world also follows
  American dictums. Thus, when the world of ours is mired in global terrorism
  who has time to think about what goes on in the hinterland of Africa, which
  was once called the Dark Continent by white men.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">On May 19, 2004, I heard an in depth report on human
  rights violation that is going on right now in the Darfur region of western
  Sudan in National Public Radio (NPR)’s &quot;Morning Edition&quot; program.
  I was not fully aware of the viciousness of the on going genocide against the
  indigenous people of western Sudan perpetrated by militias who are
  predominantly of Arabic extraction. Therefore, in one sense it is a classic
  case of ethnic cleansing, which has been going on for several months.
  Unfortunately, the news of the plight of indigenous black people of western
  Sudan, who speak a dialect of Bantu language, came to us very late when an
  astounding 30,000 people have lost their lives. The perpetrators of the
  genocide are Arabic speaking Sudanese Muslims who works for the government in
  some capacity. Surprisingly, the victims are Muslims too. Therefore, unlike
  the past Muslim versus Christian feud in Sudan that made the headlines a few
  years ago, this time around the conflict has racial overtone. In this case,
  the victims complained that they were targeted primarily for their ethnicity
  and for their dislike of authoritarian regime in Khartoum. The Arab Sudanese
  have raided hundreds of villages in Darfur region in the west, burned houses,
  taken forcibly the villagers’ cattle, raped their women, forced them to flee
  out of Sudan. The villagers after losing every tangible asset they had moved
  to neighboring Chad where a draught-like condition exists at this time.
  International relief organizations have set up refugee camps over there. Some
  experts who are now at the scene in Chad have opined that if corrective
  actions are not taken now, an estimated 350,000 indigenous people from Darfur
  region may die of malnutrition, hunger, and disease. Under this backdrop, it
  remains to be seen what the civilized democracies of the world would do to
  assuage the plight of the refugees.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">The NPR’s web site has the following blurb -
  &quot;In Western Sudan, a conflict worsens -- and some say it's the world's
  latest case of ethnic cleansing. Can lessons from the past help leaders
  prevent genocides in the future? We look at attempts to avoid a humanitarian
  disaster in Sudan.&quot; The</font><font face="verdana" size="3"> </font><font face="verdana">NPR
  interviewed 4 experts who forewarned the danger that is lurking in Darfur
  region of Western Sudan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">It is very disturbing to know that when a full-scale
  genocide takes place not many people in the world are aware of it happening.
  It is only after when the genocide is completed that we hear about it. Take
  the case of Armenian Genocide that took place during the World War I
  (1914-1918) in the hands of Turks in which about 600,000 to 1 million ethnic
  Armenians lost their lives or the Holocaust in which about 6 million Jews were
  exterminated by Nazis during the World War II (1939-1945). The world quite did
  not notice the extermination of such a huge number of people. In 1947, when
  India and Pakistan were being created, the world witnessed killings of both
  Hindus and Muslims that may surpass a million marks. In 1971, the Punjabi
  dominated army of Pakistan killed an estimated 3 million Bangalees purely for
  political reason. Again, the world remained very silent. In April 1994, the
  Hutu tribesmen of Rwanda killed about 800,000 Tutsi tribal people in a civil
  war but we learned about the systematic genocide once the killing had stopped.
  Therefore, it is imperative that the plight of Bantu-speaking indigenous
  people of western Sudan be told at this time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">A week after I heard the news of the recent genocide
  in western Sudan, I saw a video clip in the evening television news in the ABC
  network. We saw Sudanese Arab militia raiding a village in Darfur region. The
  perpetrators came riding horse or camel. They beat the local Bantu people with
  stick while igniting their house made with straws and other ignitable plant
  materials. The unarmed indigenous people were fleeing nervously leaving their
  house and cattle. It was later reported that the Arab Sudanese were after the
  cattle, which they rounded up and take with them. Therefore, the Arab Sudanese
  are doing this ethnic cleansing for financial gain and at the same time
  squashing the rebels who despise an authoritarian government in Khartoum.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">To give the readers some idea about how serious the
  problem is in western Sudan let me just cite some figures pertaining to
  refugees and effected people in Darfur region. The U.N. has said an estimated
  one million people have been displaced by the conflict in Darfur, and calls it
  the largest humanitarian emergency facing the world at this time. It also says
  about 120,000 refugees have crossed into neighboring Chad.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Rebels and human rights groups have accused Sudan’s
  government of arming militias of Arab heritage to loot and burn black African
  villages, and accused Khartoum of carrying out ethnic cleansing, a charge the
  government readily dismisses. Villagers and human rights groups accuse
  Khartoum of arming the janjaweed (horseback riders) to loot and burn African
  villages and fight a proxy war against rebels who launched a revolt last year
  demanding a fairer share of power and resources. The Khartoum government,
  however, readily denies the charge, calling the janjaweed outlaws. Western
  powers including U.S. should mount an aggressive diplomatic campaign to ensure
  that the government in Khartoum implements a promise to provide immediate,
  full access for aid operations to effected people, including opening the
  railway line so that the UN can deliver food and medicine from Port Sudan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Regarding the present crisis in Darfur region of
  Western Sudan the powerful think-tank organization the International Crisis
  Group (ICG) said, &quot;Urgent international action is required on several
  fronts if ‘Darfur 2004’ is not to join ‘Rwanda 1994.&quot; The ICG
  invoked the memory of Rwanda 1994 as shorthand for international shame in
  which the Hutu tribesmen killed an estimated 800,000 Tutsis in 1994 as world
  power did nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing in East Central African nation
  of Rwanda. The ICG also said, &quot;What UN officials have already called the
  worst humanitarian situation in the world today could claim an additional
  350,000 in the next nine months, mainly from starvation and disease.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">To give credence to the Darfur genocide respected
  international human rights organization Amnesty International (AI) has done
  its investigation. On June 8, 2004, the AI gave press release in which it
  mentioned that incommunicado detentions, unfair trials, torture, and ill
  treatment of western Sudanese are the hidden side of the Darfur conflict.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Because of the wide coverage in late May 2004,
  international attention has focused on the humanitarian crisis in Darfur;
  however, the failure of the legal system, which underpins the human rights
  crisis, has gone practically unnoticed. The vast majority of detainees in
  Darfur and those arrested outside Darfur in connection with the conflict were
  not told the reasons for their arrest. The arrestees are not allowed access to
  lawyers, families, and medical assistance. They are denied their right to be
  brought promptly before a judge or other judicial official. Torture is
  widespread amongst the detainees. The AI further stated, &quot;The failure of
  the justice system cannot be ignored. Injustice is not just a consequence of
  the conflict; it is one of its causes. These abuses, like the fighting, will
  worsen if immediate preventative measures aren’t taken.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Because of the wide news coverage in the western
  nations and also due to pleas from Amnesty International (AI), the
  international donors' conference on Darfur met in Geneva on June 3, 2004 to
  decide how to provide humanitarian help to displaced people from Western
  Sudan. We hope that the conflict between the rebel group (of western Sudan)
  and Arab militias will come to end because of outside intervention. Let us not
  forget that the conflict has engendered the refugee problem. Without this
  political conflict ending soon, the problem in Darfur region will not go away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">In summary, a regional political crisis in western
  Sudan had engendered a wide-scale ethnic cleansing in Western Sudan. The
  indigenous black people who speak local language (of Bantu family) are the
  victim in this conflict. The Arab militias who are loyal to Sudanese
  government are the aggressors. An estimated 30,000 black Sudanese have so far
  been killed, about a million people have left their homes; some have moved to
  neighboring Chad creating a massive refugee problem. If humanitarian aid does
  not reach these displaced people, an estimated 300,000 refugees may die
  because of hunger, malnutrition, and disease. Political pressure should be
  applied from donor countries and neighboring Muslim nations so that Khartoum
  government immediately stops mobilizing Arab militias to western Sudan. The
  refugees should be brought back to their villages as soon as possible. Lest we
  forget, genocide is a crime punishable by a trial in the International Court
  of Justice. Let the Khartoum government be aware of this. The ex-President of
  Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, is now being tried for genocide against Kosovo
  Albanians and committing crime against humanity. The same could apply for the
  head of the authoritarian regime that runs Khartoum administration.
  Incidentally, the government is run by an alliance of the military and the
  National Congress Party (NCP), formerly the National Islamic Front (NIF),
  which espouses an Islamist platform.</font></p>
