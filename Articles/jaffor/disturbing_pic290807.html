		<p align="justify">I chanced to see the photo of a fleeing and terrified 
		military officer who was about to be kicked from behind by a protester. 
		The officer was probably worried and he wanted to get away from the main 
		street and that explains why he was in hurry to retreat. It was a lucky 
		day for the protester that the photographer very cleverly did not take 
		the image of his face. Or else, he would be caught and taken at midnight 
		hour for interrogation; never mind the physical abuse.</p>
		<p align="center">
	<img border="0" src="../avijit/military-bashing.jpg" width="345" height="351"><br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">When I saw the image for the very first time, I 
		chuckled to myself and did not think seriously about the ramification of 
		this photo. But how wrong was I? On August 28, 2007 I saw the photo 
		again in the net but this time it was in
		<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6966467.stm">BBC news</a> 
		and the title of the news story was “It is an image that has caused the 
		army much embarrassment.” I personally found the story as depicted in 
		the BBC write-up a very intriguing one.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">This image of a hatless army officer in terrified 
		retreat and the sandled feet of a demonstrator about to kick the behind 
		of the retreating army officer epitomizes the mess the joint forces of 
		army, RAB, and police have made in Bangladesh during the three-day 
		demonstration in late August 2007 in which tens and thousands of 
		protestors took to the streets in bold defiance of the stricter laws 
		that prohibit milling of ordinary citizens for the purpose of 
		protestation.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">While vividly describing the image, the BBC news man 
		John Sudworth put it evocatively the mess the military is in right now 
		in Bangladesh. He wrote as follows – “If a single image can sum up the 
		thorny mess into which Bangladesh has once again stumbled, then this 
		perhaps is it.”<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">John Sudworth was talking to rank and file of 
		Bangladesh military on the first night of the curfew and he found out 
		that the foot soldiers of Bangladesh were not very happy seeing the 
		image in popular press. The BBC reporter summed it up as follows: “Its 
		publication was seen as a humiliation, every bit as great as if that 
		flying sandaled foot had been aimed at the behind of the army chief 
		himself.”<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">What followed after quelling the rebellion is equally 
		disturbing. The government's secret police visited the quarters of a few 
		senior university teachers and they took them to unnamed destination 
		where they were interrogated and tortured to extract information about 
		student-led rebellion of the masses.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">The chief advisor, law and information advisor, and 
		the army chief had openly said that the mass rebellion was staged by the 
		“enemy” of the nation by pumping crores of Taka (Bangladesh's monetary 
		unit). They also put forth their pet notion that the rebellion was 
		squashed by the government forces; therefore, a disaster was averted and 
		Bangladesh saved from a bloody civil war. The same trio representing the 
		government had said that a conspiracy was hatched to take advantage of 
		the student protest to destabilize the nation and which was foiled. <br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">The military-back government decided to teach a 
		lesson to university professors who they think had instigated the 
		student-led rebellion. Therefore, five professors were rounded up a la 
		Gestapo tactic. At wee hours of the night the government’s secret 
		service men armed to their teeth knock on the door to arrest these 
		professors. The harrowing tale of the arrest of Prof. Anwar Hossain was 
		narrated by his son, Sanjeeb Hossain. The family members did not know 
		the whereabouts of Dr. Hossain but few days later the family learned via 
		a whispering voice coming through a cellphone that he would be in a 
		court. There, Sanjeeb met his father very briefly; they exchanged vital 
		information and the professor told his son of the ordeal he had gone 
		through. Apparently the senior professor was subjected to both 
		psychological and physical torture. <br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">Needless to say, this is a way with the military in 
		Bangladesh. Only months ago a community leader belonging to minority 
		Garo tribe by the name Choles Ritchil was whisked away by military men 
		from a bridal party and later he was found lying dead with torture mark 
		allover his body. Trust me, this won’t happen to the arrested professors 
		because not only they are important people but also all eyes are on 
		them. Through the blazing speed of the Internet expatriate Bangalees 
		allover the world has come to know the plights of the arrested 
		professors and some activists have already wrote e-petition and 
		gathering signatures electronically. Mind you, some of these petitions 
		are being directed to the U.N. Secretary General who may decide the fate 
		of Bangladesh military for future peacekeeping mission. The other 
		petitions are will be forwarded to various senators, congressmen in the 
		U.S. and to the EU secretariat. Bangladesh depends heavily on donor 
		nations for funding the nation's myriad developmental project. These 
		days it is not difficult to launch a PR campaign via information 
		highway. The military of Bangladesh may have their weapons but the 
		expatriate Bangalees have far more powerful weapon to strangulate them 
		via e-petitions.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">Thanks also to the Internet for the dissemination of 
		very disturbing images and accompanying news stories. They help form an 
		opinion and trust me this time around many expatriate Bangalees who had 
		the view that the military-backed interim government was onto doing some 
		good work for the country by arresting some vile and corrupt politicians 
		but when they learned that this wayward government is very much involved 
		in other controversial things such as eviction of poor people from urban 
		slums, re-engineering political parties, arresting many politicians on 
		fabricated charges, and above all doing very little to check the soaring 
		prices of everyday kitchen items, their cumulative ire fell on military 
		who is the purveyor of Fakhruddin Administration.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">Gen. Moeen, the man behind the interim government, 
		cut his trip short and returned to Dhaka where he said that the military 
		has averted a civil war. By all accounts, the student-led protest 
		movement developed extemporaneously (carried out without much 
		preparation) but the chief advisor, law and information advisor, and 
		Gen. Moeen had smelled a conspiracy. Without naming any group or people 
		they all said that the student protest movement was hijacked by the 
		“enemy” of the state to destabilize and pit common masses against the 
		army.<br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">As the army-backed government of Fakhruddin was 
		revealing its true color, the students at Dhaka University looked at the 
		army inside the campus with nothing more than disdain and contempt. 
		These soldiers suddenly represented Gen. Moeen and other military 
		leaders who are the real power behind the civilian-led government. They 
		did not like their presence in the campus. Therefore, when the soldiers 
		roughed up some students, all the ire they had on army Generals fell on 
		the garden variety soldiers. The protest movement then spilled over to 
		neighboring areas and before one could count ten the movement spread 
		like a wild fire. Strange things are known to happen when masses run 
		amuck in the streets. The humiliation the army faced because of the 
		photo of a terrified and retreating soldier graced the page of a popular 
		newspaper. It was bad for the ego of Bangladesh military. That is the 
		only reason when a military officer on patrol met BBC correspondent John 
		Sudworth in the dead of the night, he said that how he hated that photo. 
		The officer also thought that the newspaper was irresponsible to publish 
		that image. <br>
		</p>
		<p align="justify">The blissful and easy cantonment life in Kurmitola 
		that is full of hubris will never be the same after the publication of 
		that disdainful image of the retreating and panic-stricken military 
		officer. Bangladesh’s military perhaps needed this humiliation to make 
		them understand that the public is upper hand because they pay for the 
		easy lifestyle of an army that has no external enemy. No wonder 
		Bangladesh army ever fought against any external enemy since the bloody 
		birth of this nation in 1971. Just think for a moment how much of the 
		GDP was siphoned year-after-year to look after this privileged men in 
		uniform who only know how to turn their weapon against the public who 
		foot their bill. </p>
