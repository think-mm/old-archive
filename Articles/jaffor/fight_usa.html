      five months after I heard an in-depth report on ideological clash between 
      the conservatives (Sons of Reagan) versus the liberals (sons of America).&nbsp; 
      At the time, I never did realize that the same clash would shape up the 
      election of November 2, 2004.&nbsp; Now that the election is over, we are doing 
      a soul searching to figure out why John Kerry lost this election.&nbsp; To 
      better understand what an uphill battle John Kerry had to fight in this 
      election, please read my article.&nbsp; On a personal note, I sent this article 
      to one of the leading newspapers in Dhaka only to see that this piece 
      never saw the light of the day.&nbsp; The editorial staff of that paper never 
      could fathom out the complexity of the ideological war that was brought 
      into politics in America in 1980 when Ronald Reagan ran for the first time 
      for the highest office in this land.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a lazy Tuesday morning early in January 2004, it 
    was January 6 to be exact, the outside temperature was cold, and the wind 
    was gusting from north as I was heading towards my office.&nbsp; An analysis of a 
    socio-political trend in America as I heard in the car radio gave me even 
    chiller than what I endured in this nippy January morning.&nbsp; It has become a 
    second nature for me to tune to National Public Radio (NPR) to learn the 
    comings and goings of this mortal world.&nbsp; The baritone voice of the 
    anchorperson Bob Edwards usually fills my car.&nbsp; Thanks to scientific 
    breakthrough!&nbsp; Without a car radio, driving could be a very tiresome job.&nbsp; I 
    learned a great many things about American and world politics, societal 
    affairs, showbiz world, and whatnot.&nbsp; On January 6, 2004, the NPR brought a 
    modern-day philosopher whose name I cannot remember now.&nbsp; Too bad, I did not 
    jot the commentator’s name.&nbsp; But that is beside the point.&nbsp; The topic of 
    discussion was division in American society based on political philosophy.&nbsp;
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentator let the listeners know his 
    erudition about the division we have in American society.&nbsp; According to him, 
    American polity can be grossly divided into two divergent camps.&nbsp; The first 
    camp is of course the conservative group that is known to some sociologists 
    as “Sons of Ronald Reagan.”&nbsp; The second group is the liberal camp.&nbsp; Some 
    sociologists also call this group as “Secular group.”&nbsp; These two groups have 
    nothing common between them as far as political philosophy is concerned.&nbsp; 
    The die-hard Republicans are very much part of this conservative group.&nbsp; On 
    the other hand, the most liberal folks of America who normally votes for the 
    candidate from Democratic Party belong to the secular camp.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‘Sons of Ronald Reagan’ tend to side with 
    Christianity; therefore, one could characterize the camp as some kind of 
    ‘faith-based’ group.&nbsp; Members of this group believe that the government 
    should not interfere in people’s life.&nbsp; Therefore, big government is not 
    their cup of tea.&nbsp; From time-to-time, the members of this group publicly say 
    that American government is too big and bureaucracy stifles progress in 
    America.&nbsp; They also naïvely think that the “trickle down” theory of Ronald 
    Reagan works to boost the national economy.&nbsp; The premise of this line of 
    thinking is the following: give the reach folks a break in terms of taxes, 
    and they will invest the saved money, which will in turn boost the economy.&nbsp; 
    Therefore, money saved by the rich will somehow find its way into productive 
    investment.&nbsp; Many economists do not think that the rich folks are that eager 
    to invest theirs saved money because of altruistic belief.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other important traits of ‘Sons of Ronald 
    Reagan’ that are worth mentioning here for the sake of differentiating them 
    from the “Secular group’ are: they religiously attend church services and 
    are avowed Christian; they do not believe in gun control and are most likely 
    sympathetic to National Rifle Association’s causes to promote gun ownership; 
    they probably support prayer in school and they are all for school 
    segregation.&nbsp; They won’t admit to it that they don’t favor equal opportunity 
    employer clause of the U.S. constitution.&nbsp; They favor faith-based charity, 
    the one lately promoted by Mr. George W. Bush.&nbsp; One more thing that I forgot 
    to mention about “Sons of Ronald Reagan’ is: they think they are the only 
    champion of patriotism.&nbsp; Thus, in their mind they are the only flag-waving 
    patriots in America. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‘Secular group’ holds the view that one does 
    not have to attend church religiously (no pun intended) and carry guns to 
    show their overt patriotism.&nbsp; The followers of this group believe in the 
    total good of the society as opposed to a narrow section of the society 
    dominated by rich and affluent people.&nbsp; People belonging to this group 
    strongly held the view tax burden should be borne by all citizens.&nbsp; Many 
    activists belonging to this group call themselves “Sons of America.”&nbsp; </font>

    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The social commentator narrating the differences 
    between the two opposing ideologues had opined in the NPR show that these 
    two groups are in collision course.&nbsp; If a middle ground is not found in 
    American society, then there may be some unforeseen problem.&nbsp; Intellectuals 
    belonging to these two groups are fighting it out in the airwaves.&nbsp; America 
    now has many talk radio shows scattered all over.&nbsp; One can hear either a 
    conservative talk show host blabbering about the virtues of being a “Sons of 
    Reagan.”&nbsp; On the other extreme, there are those ultra liberal talk show 
    hosts who constantly complain how things are rotten in America and how 
    God-fearing and church-going Republicans are taking the country to warpath 
    by invoking Crusade.&nbsp; After 9-11, the moral majority Christian groups have 
    become vocal all of a sudden.&nbsp; They are trying to exert their influence on 
    George W. Bush, who certainly belongs to the conservative camp at least 
    outwardly.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To gauge an idea where this society is headed, one 
    should look at the upcoming election result slated for November 2004.&nbsp; If a 
    majority of the folks, who are in the middle of this tug-of-war, sides with 
    ‘Sons of Reagan,’ then Mr. Bush will come out victorious.&nbsp; On the other 
    hand, if the same bunch moves towards “Sons of America,’ then, Senator 
    Kerry, the Democratic candidate for President may win the election.&nbsp; 
    American politics will be dominated by these two competing force no doubt.&nbsp; 
    The interplay between the conservative and the liberals shapes the future of 
    this great democracy.&nbsp; I sensed that even three decades ago when I first 
    came to America to attend a graduate program in Molecular Biology.&nbsp; This 
    great democracy was mired over Vietnam War issue and Mr. Richard Nixon who 
    was better known in the campus as “Tricky Dick” (Dick is an abbreviated form 
    of Richard) was manning the White House.&nbsp; The conservatives all sided with 
    President Nixon and Secretary Henry Kissinger as the administration had 
    escalated the war in Vietnam and extending it all the way to Cambodia.&nbsp; The 
    liberals were not sitting idle either.&nbsp; The colleges and campuses were 
    strongholds of liberal folks; the students and faculty members had expressed 
    their disdain through innumerable peaceful protest march and sit in that 
    resulted in National Armed Guards firing in Kent State University in Ohio 
    causing death of 4 students in April or May 1970.&nbsp; Many extreme or hyper 
    liberal youngsters in those turbulent days had joined the hippiedom and 
    chanted “No War, Make Love” to show their disgust towards American 
    jingoism.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen the same rift between the liberals and 
    conservatives in the seventies through now.&nbsp; During the presidency of Ronald 
    Reagan the “Moral Majority’ Christian group used to paddle influence on 
    White House to set the agenda for social reform and legislation.&nbsp; The 
    influence of that group on Ronald Reagan at least outwardly may have 
    contributed to the naming of ultra conservatives of America as “Sons of 
    Ronald Reagan.”&nbsp; Since Ronald Reagan’s time, which ended in 1988, many 
    public debates over school prayer, pledge of legion in school, banning of 
    abortion, school de-segregation, gun control, civil rights issues, 
    legalization of marijuana and other habit forming drugs, gay marriage, etc., 
    have all but polarized the great American society.&nbsp; I am sure many other 
    issues will emerge in the coming days to serve as a litmus test for 
    liberalism and conservatism no doubt.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">
    <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my judgment, Americans did realize a long time 
    ago that the interplay between liberals and conservatives would shape up 
    their society.&nbsp; No monolithic idea will ever dominate the cultural and 
    political milieu of this nation, which had become a vanguard of democracy.&nbsp; 
    I wished many times that other nations including many emerging democracies 
    on earth will follow the American model to develop their societies through 
    the interplay of both liberal and conservative ideas for there are rooms for 
    competing views in any society.&nbsp; The ongoing fight between the “Sons of 
    Reagan” and “Sons of America” is a perfect example of how the interplay 
    between two competing camps is shaping the future of a country that is in 
    the forefront of modern civilization at this time, which is correctly 
    attributed as being the American Century.</font></div>
