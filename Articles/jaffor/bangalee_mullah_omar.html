      <br>
      On May 6, 2004, I read in the Daily Star for the first time that a
      ‘Mullah Omar’ like figure by the name Azizur Rahman aka Bangla Bhai (a
      non-standard Bangla construction!) who is dispensing justice in the
      northwestern districts of Bangladesh.<br>
      <br>
      This man’s activities reminded me of Mullah Omar who was doing the same
      thing in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in the aftermath of civil war in the late
      1980s when Russian soldiers had left the war-torn nation. Mullah Omar then
      formed a Vigilante Force with ragtag Madrassah students, which finally
      emerged as a very powerful political force. This is the way the Taliban
      party came into existence.<br>
      <br>
      The Talibans in Kandahar and elsewhere in Afghanistan had meted out
      justice to miscreants. Ordinary Afghanis liked it so much so that they
      encouraged the Talibans to take control of their nation. And Mullah Omar
      and his brigands just did that. The rest is history.<br>
      <br>
      In Bangladesh, a similar thing is happening right now. One Azizur Rahman
      has formed a group of vigilantes by the name ‘Jagrota Muslim Janata
      Bangladesh’ or JMJB to catch the members of an outlaw group, Sarbahara
      and mete out street justice. The sad part is the police are encouraging
      the rural force to aid JMJB brigands to catch the Bangladeshi desperados (Sarbahara).
      That is not all what the JMBJ operatives are doing in the western
      districts of Bangladesh. The leader, ‘Bangla Bhai’ is also enforcing
      strictest Islamic dress code among females. This was reported in the Daily
      Star report.<br>
      <br>
      It seems as if the JMJB members are trying to enforce religious dictums
      among ordinary people. Asking men to grow beards and women to sport burka
      (veil) is a direct infringement to personal freedom of our people. The
      JMBJ goons forgot that about 10-11% people in Bangladesh are not Muslims.
      On top of it, many Muslims may not like the idea of keeping beard or
      wearing burka in a climate that is very hostile to wear Islamic garb,
      which is ideal for desert climate in hot summer months.<br>
      <br>
      The question that pops out is – who this JMBJ thinks they are?
      Bangladesh is not like Afghanistan where there was no police force to
      enforce law and order in the wake of the civil war. Bangladesh is a
      burgeoning democracy and the nation has a police force. Therefore, there
      should not be any vigilantes manning the streets to catch outlaws such as
      Sarbahara men.<br>
      <br>
      The ruffians who go by the name JMBJ are trying to shove ultra-Islamic
      values down the throat of Bangalees in rural areas. Strangely enough, the
      Deputy Inspector of Police, Noor Mohammad, instead of admonishing Azizur
      ran aka ‘Bangla Bhai’ for taking laws into his own hand had bestowed a
      glowing encomium to him and his ruffians for a job “well done.”<br>
      <br>
      There should not be any Vigilante Force operating in Bangladesh because it
      undermines the capabilities of the police, which is the arm of the
      government to maintain law and order throughout Bangladesh. It seems as if
      the police in the western districts where JMBJ is very active is
      inoperative now and are relying on the ruffians managed by Azizur Rahman
      aka ‘Bangla Bhai’ to maintain law and order. This has to be a terrible
      development.<br>
      <br>
      The Inspector General of Police in Bangladesh should immediately visit the
      affected districts and sack those police officers who gave moral support
      to JMBJ thugs. The DIG of Police, Noor Mohammad, should also be
      reprimanded for encouraging the Vigilante Force to carry out street
      justice. The Home Mister should not twiddle his thumb sitting in Dhaka
      hearing the news of vigilantes manning the law and order plus acting as
      judge all at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      This scribe has seen the photo of Azizur Rahman aka Bangla Bhai who
      sported his full beard in the picture. This megalomaniac wants to enforce
      his ideas on ordinary people. Suggesting men to keep beards in this day
      and age is simply preposterous an idea. He is also admonishing women folks
      for not wearing burka. Therefore, it follows that this madman is bent on
      enforcing his values on others. Bangladeshi people are granted freedom of
      choice by the constitution of this free nation.<br>
      <br>
      Why is this man hell-bent on denying the rural folks their constitutional
      right? To add insult to injury, the police are encouraging JMBJ ruffians
      to enforce street justice. It is quite possible that some innocent people
      may receive the street justice from Azizur Rahman and his loyal
      supporters.<br>
      <br>
      A correspondent of DS from Naogaon reported that JMJB men yesterday
      allegedly beat three outlaws to death at Atrai in western part of the
      nation. Bangladesh has court system in place and only the judges can mete
      out justice. There should not be a parallel judiciary in Bangladesh. It
      seems as if Azizur Rahman and his gang of vigilantes are running a
      parallel judiciary in Bangladesh with blessings from the police.<br>
      <br>
      Judging from all the reports appearing in the newspapers this scribe
      thinks that Azizur Rahman has become a sort of like warlord. If this
      megalomaniac ‘Bangla Bhai’ is not emasculated soon, other regional
      ‘warlords’ will emerge in various districts. Therefore, this newly
      developed Vigilante Force should be nipped in the bud.<br>
      <br>
      The inept police of Bangladesh have miserably failed to capture members of
      the outlaw group Sarbahara and now they are relying on a roving gang of
      ruffians such as JMJB members to enforce law in rural districts. It is
      also apparent that the JMJB men have other ideas in their head. They want
      strictest brand of Islam such as Wahhabism and its code of conduct to be
      enforced in Bangladesh. This is the same ploy Mullah Omar of Kandahar used
      to gain notoriety and power.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe, Azizur Rahman aka ‘Bangla Bhai’ is using the same method to
      gain power and popularity among our rural folks. The sooner the government
      crushes this neo-Talibanism in Bangladesh the better. There should not be
      two police forces and two judiciaries in Bangladesh. Therefore, the
      government should declare JMBJ an illegal or outlaw organization. But more
      than anything, the self-declared leader ‘Bangla Bhai’ should be
      brought to justice for dispensing his brand of “justice.”<br>
