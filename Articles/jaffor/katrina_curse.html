	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About 3 weeks before hurricane 
	Katrina came ashore at the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana on 
	August 29, 2005, a tropical disturbance was engendered somewhere closer to 
	African continent 10 degrees north of equator. People who track developing 
	tropical waves did not pay much attention to this disturbance. However, very 
	quietly, the tropical mass started to move towards northern part of South 
	America. This journey took several days. Again, the weather and atmospheric 
	science folks in America did not pay much attention to this tropical 
	disturbance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After Katrina became a household 
	name in America and elsewhere in the globe when the wrath of the cyclonic 
	force wreaked havoc in Gulf Coast, USA, many an atmospheric science expert 
	wanted to know how this killer storm developed in a short span of time. What 
	I gathered from news media is that when the weak tropical mass came near 
	northeastern region of South America, another weak tropical system, which 
	had developed a very weak counter clock circulation merged with the moving 
	tropical mass from equatorial Africa. This merging of two weak tropical 
	disturbances was an ominous sign. The second wave provided the much-needed 
	counter-clock circulation that strengthens a hurricane. Before we know 
	anything, the weak disturbances started to show sign of real “life.” In the 
	third weak of August 2005, this tropical disturbance caught the attention of 
	hurricane enthusiast. The system was well developed by this time and the US 
	Hurricane forecasting agency of the federal government started tracking the 
	massive low-pressure system. Suddenly, the disturbance became a tropical 
	storm; it was moving towards Florida’s coastline. Within twenty-four hours, 
	the tropical storm strengthened enough to receive a name. As per the list 
	already made by authorities, the cyclonic (hurricane) force was Christened 
	“Katrina.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hurricane Katrina’s first victim was 
	southern Florida. She was a full-blown hurricane by now and she hit 
	Florida’s Gulf coast with much vengeance. As per news, few people died in 
	the extreme lower part of Florida due to the hurricane. By August 23-24, 
	2005, Katrina weakened a bit because she lost some punch; consequently, she 
	lost her “coveted” hurricane status for barely 24 hours. The weather 
	forecaster thought Katrina would regain strength to become a weak Cat One 
	(category one hurricane) at best and would hit some place in the Gulf Coast. 
	But, boy! Were they wrong? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Katrina rapidly regained her 
	strength to become a Cat 3 hurricane within 48 hours. Thanks to the hot 
	surface water of Gulf of Mexico. The rapid strengthening of Katrina as a 
	cyclonic force alarmed those of us living on the Gulf Coast. The news people 
	along with the mayor of New Orleans sounded the alarm bell. People, who live 
	in the lower Plaquemine parish (county), 50-60 miles south of New Orleans, 
	were given a mandatory evacuation notice. A day later on Friday when Katrina 
	was bearing down 300 miles or so to the southwest of New Orleans a panic 
	broke out in Crescent City, which is home to about half a million people. 
	The storm gathered enough force to become rapidly a Cat 5 hurricane (the 
	strongest a hurricane could become). <br>
	As this ominous development was taking place on October 27, 2005, tens and 
	thousands of New Orlenians hit the road going every which way fanning out to 
	northern Louisiana, Mississippi, eastern Texas, northern Alabama, 
	Southeastern Tennessee, and southern Georgia. By late Saturday (August 27), 
	the city became a ghost town. Folks who were too poor to own a car did not 
	leave the city; these folks either walked or took a bus ride to Super Dome, 
	a huge sports arena. In the hindsight, it was a bad decision by the city 
	administration. When Katrina was lashing out New Orleans with 120-130 miles 
	gusts, a section of the roof at Super Dome (a closed sports area) collapsed 
	causing extensive flooding inside the indoor stadium on August 29, 2005 
	(Monday). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My family and I did not join the 
	exodus New Orleanians took on Friday and Saturday. All the highways fanning 
	out of New Orleans to the North and West were crammed with cars turning the 
	highways into a virtual parking lot. I decided not to join the crowd. On 
	Sunday morning, the day before Katrina came ashore, my wife urged me to 
	leave the house; she was preparing to get out of Slidell. My eldest son, 
	Rashad, called me from New Haven, Connecticut. He also begged me to leave 
	because Katrina had already become a full-blown Cat 5 hurricane. Quite a few 
	people and family members who live in different parts of America called me 
	to tell that they are concerned about our safety. In the meantime, the 
	Hurricane Center in Florida, the main forecasting authority of the U.S. 
	government, warned that Katrina would land in any place within the 100-mile 
	zone starting from western New Orleans to Mississippi-Alabama border to the 
	east. Hearing this prognosis, I was alarmed. In about half an hour time, I 
	prepared myself for evacuating from the house. My wife and our daughter were 
	already standing outside our house pacing nervously. Most of my neighbor 
	left already. My wife asked me to drive my car by myself so that we could 
	take two cars. I soundly rejected her suggestion. I put my car inside the 
	garage and placed my new laptop and a digital mixing board on the top shelf 
	of a closet (8 feet high). This turned out to be one of the wisest decisions 
	that I took on that day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The city where I live wore a panic 
	look; not many people in the street and gas stations were all shut down. 
	There were some latecomer (should be late-goer) like me trying to fill the 
	gas tank of the car. By 2:30 p.m., we were gone. In two hours time I covered 
	about 80 miles to the northwest. My son was navigating me from a safe 
	distance with the help of cellphone. He said, “Father, whatever you do, do 
	not go towards northeast. I drove in the northwest direction all the while 
	reaching Kentwood, Louisiana, by 5:30 p.m. Twelve hours later Katrina roared 
	into New Orleans-Slidell-Gulfport-Biloxi area affecting the life of about 
	2.5 to 3 million people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">America never did experience a 
	natural disaster of this magnitude. As of this writing (September 7, 2005), 
	some parts of New Orleans are still flooded. My home is now dry, water had 
	receded now, and a wall of 6-8 feet of water got into the house destroying 
	almost everything inside. Like many other affected people in Louisiana, and 
	Mississippi, how am I going to clean the mess and start a new life again?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Katrina was a killer hurricane that 
	killed hundreds of people. The body count is not complete. People are now 
	reporting missing relatives to authorities. It will take a long time before 
	we know how many people simply perished under the spell of Katrina. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This monster hurricane will 
	certainly go down in the history as the storm that disrupted million lives. 
	In 1965, another hurricane by the name Betsy struck New Orleans area; the 
	city’s old folks used to talk about the destruction caused by that storm. 
	After Katrina struck New Orleans area on August 29, 2005, people will forget 
	about the damage caused by Betsy because Katrina’s destruction pales the one 
	done by the former. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Katrina taught a lesson of lifetime 
	to Americans living in the Gulf Coast. Mother Nature unleashed her fury on 
	three million people residing on coastline. These folks will have a mental 
	scar embedded in their mind for the rest of their life. Katrina’s fury was 
	too much to bear. She smashed the dream of many a folk. The fury Katrina 
	unleashed on million innocent people will go in infamy. This author lost 
	every material thing that he accumulated in the last twenty years. Katrina 
	took it all away. Nevertheless, the good-old memory that swirls inside our 
	head will keep on rotating and that Katrina could not take away with all her 
	fury.</font><br>
