	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The last eighty days had been 
	nightmarish for the 145 million people of Bangladesh. A pall of gloom hung 
	over Bangladesh as President Iajuddin sat at the helm making one mistake 
	after another. Thanks to the free press that kept people’s hope and 
	aspiration alive. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I never thought that I would live to 
	see Bangladesh’s politics roiled so badly by the action of a lone person. 
	Ever since President Iajuddin self-appointed him to be the chief of the 
	executive branch of Bangladesh’s government by becoming the Chief Advisor of 
	the caretaker government in late October 2006, the country had a rough and 
	bumpy ride. Many constitutional experts in Bangladesh had opined that 
	Iajuddin’s ascension to power in autumn could not be supported by the 
	constitution of the land. But then, many things in Bangladesh do not go 
	right. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The main opposition party and its 
	alliance had reluctantly accepted Iajuddin’s self-appointment hoping that he 
	would maintain his neutrality as he and 10-member committee of advisors 
	would prepare and steer the nation for a fair election within the next 90 
	days. The caretaker government would cease to exist once a new government 
	would be in office and a new parliament convenes in Dhaka. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iajuddin and his advisors could have 
	fulfilled their duties facilely had he charted a neutral course. 
	Unfortunately, he did not do that. From the day one he was indecisive and 
	looking for direction from outside. He hardly sat in a meeting with his 
	advisors in the first week. Finally, when he did his advisors took some 
	decision regarding the appointment of few key members in the Election 
	Commission but then he reversed the course pronto. At one time he kept his 
	advisors in the dark while mobilizing the military. That irked a few of his 
	advisors. This vacillation in decision making went on for the first 3 weeks. 
	From the president’s action it was very clear that he was not offering any 
	solution but he became a part of the massive problem. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After few weeks when it became 
	abundantly clear that he was playing a partisan game while seating at the 
	catbird seat of power in Dhaka, the four brightest and very best advisors 
	tendered their resignation while lamenting that they cannot serve the nation 
	under him. Before the ink of their resignation letters could dry, Iajuddin 
	appointed four advisors of whom two were deeply involved in partisan 
	politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iajuddin gave a lip service to 
	Election Commission reform – a demand from the opposition, while adamantly 
	he said that the election would take place as scheduled on January 22, 2007. 
	The opposition cried foul by pointing out that the voter’s list was 
	antiquated and filled with fake names. They pressed their demand to correct 
	the voter’s list and make it up-to-date. However, President Iajuddin turned 
	a deaf ear to this legitimate demand of the opposition parties. All these 
	inactions by Iajuddin made his party, BNP, utterly happy but the main 
	opposition, AL, and its alliance of 17 parties decided to boycott the 
	election. In cahoots with Iajuddin the EC also played a very dirty role as 
	they briefed the newsman telling them that the election would take place on 
	January 22, 2007 rain or shine. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thanks heaven that a host of donor 
	nations including USA, EU, Great Britain, and UN, all pleaded to Iajuddin 
	not to hold the election without correcting the voter’s list and without the 
	participation of major political parties. In the meantime, Sheikh Hasina, 
	the leader of the opposition gave her clarion call for boycotting the 
	one-sided election slated for January 22, 2007. True to his character 
	Iajuddin was nonchalant; without realizing the consequence of this rogue 
	election he dug his heel and a bunch of sycophants in the civil 
	administration and Election Commission who are loyal to BNP were too anxious 
	to hold the election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the political landscape in 
	Bangladesh was mired by Iajuddin’s inaction, the nation saw a looming danger 
	threatening to engulf the nation with conflagration. The nonchalant 
	president remained calm for he thought he had one last trump card buried in 
	his sleeve. In the beginning of 2007 the president played his card and 
	brought in army in the street to save the nation from agitation and chaos 
	created by no one but him. Thanks to foreign diplomats who exerted pressure 
	on Iajuddin advising him to postpone the one-sided election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iajuddin being a naïve politician 
	was in real trouble by the end of the first week of January 2007. The 
	framers of Bangladesh constitution never thought that a constitutional 
	crisis would emerge due to the failure of the caretaker government to hold 
	an election within 90 days after coming to office. There was only one way 
	out. Declare the emergency. That is what he did. And to placate him from the 
	trouble he removed himself from the seat of the power. He is now holding the 
	seat of president, a ceremonial power. The real power now belongs to the 
	chief advisor who was the senior-most person among the 10-member advisors of 
	the caretaker government. The rest resigned. We read in the newspaper that 
	10 new advisors will be appointed soon and the entire process of conducting 
	a fair election would start in earnest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now that Iajuddin is far removed 
	from the executive branch of the government let us all hope that a neutral 
	caretaker government would steward the nation for a fair and neutral 
	election. But before that could happen they should fire everyone at the 
	Election Commission, appoint a new set of officers at the EC, correct the 
	voter’s list, and give enough time for all parties to participate in the 
	election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How difficult would it be for the 
	acting head of the caretaker government to jumpstart the process? That 
	remains to be seen. I see a new beginning here. Who says a lone person 
	cannot screw up things in a nation of 145 million? It was a good riddance of 
	Iajuddin from the executive branch of the government. His name will surely 
	grace the wall of the ‘Hall of Shame.’</font></p>
