    <div class="body">
      The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Christina Rocca
      visited Dhaka in the third week of May 2004. There were concerns on the
      part of Bush Administration vis-à-vis Bangladesh because the news coming
      from this impoverished nation is causing some concern worldwide.<br>
      <br>
      For one thing, members of a virulent Islamic group emerging in the
      northwestern part of the country who goes by the name ‘Jagrata Muslim
      Janata’ (JMJ) or ‘Vigilante Muslim Masses’ have taken laws in their
      hand as they mete out “justice” by killing other Bangalees who they
      think belong to an outlaw political group. The leader of this group goes
      by the name ‘Bangla Bhai.’ The other reason the U.S. authorities are
      perturbed is due to the rise in sectarian feud between the country’s
      majority Sunni population and a minority Muslim group by the name
      Ahmadiyya.<br>
      <br>
      Many fundamentalist Muslim clerics in Bangladesh would very much like to
      see that the government of Khaleda Zia declares Ahmadiyya as non-Muslims.
      As an initial step, the government has banned the publications of
      Ahmadiyya, which is a direct assault on the minority sect of Muslims. This
      banning of their publications infringes on their rights to express their
      religious feeling guaranteed by the constitution of Bangladesh.<br>
      <br>
      Many news reports and editorials were written in May 2004 on the activity
      of JMJ cadres and their leader ‘Bangla Bhai.’ It turned out that the
      JMJ thugs were operating in few northwestern districts with the blessings
      from police and few BNP lawmakers from the same districts. Mrs. Khaleda
      Zia was powerless to suggest even to the Home Minister to issue an arrest
      warrant for JMJ chief ‘Bangla Bhai.’ The police chief – a DIG - in
      the district of Rajshahi refused all along to arrest JMJ hoodlums and
      their leader on the ground that no arrest order came from Dhaka. The JMJ
      lawbreakers were acting as if they were the lawmen in the northwestern
      districts.<br>
      <br>
      Nonetheless, the police looked the other way assuming that the JMJ goons
      violated no laws. Now upon questioning by newspaper reporters the same
      police officer say that no one from the village, where JMJ cadres were
      active, had complained against the forces of ‘<b>Bangla Bhai.</b>’
      These claims by the police are untenable, to say the least.
      <p align="center"><img src="../../images/bangla_bhai/9044-0-Bangla_Bhai__D_Satr_may_16.jpg" width="250" height="269"><br>
      <b>Bangla Bhai.</b></p>
      <p>The police hierarchy in Bangladesh knows it darn well that in the
      4-party coalition government of BNP the Islamists could exert more
      pressure on the Prime Minister. Two very powerful ministers from
      fundamentalist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, wield power and in all likelihood,
      they may have persuaded the lady Prime Minister to ignore JMJ men’s
      foray into law and order in the western districts. They must have opined
      something like this: the JMJ men are doing our agrarian society a huge
      favor by extra judicial killing of Sarbahara (communist) outlaw men. Why
      should the police interfere in the process?<br>
      <br>
      There is no question about Khaleda Zia’s meek and weak personality vis-à-vis
      the Islamists that are in her cabinet. The Islamists wield way too much
      power. They are the ones who blocked the police from arresting the JMJ
      goons in the first place. The two ministers in Khaleda Zia government were
      also aided by two members of the parliament (MPs) from northwestern
      districts of Bangladesh where the outlawed communists (Sarbahara) are
      seemed to be very active. These two MPs according to published news report
      in Dhaka had sought the help of JMJ cadres to hunt the communists. The
      policy is popularly called as “playing fire with fire.”<br>
      <br>
      Many people in the affected area in the northwestern district had
      complained to the news reporters that the JMJ men had harassed and
      physically manhandled many innocent people. For example, the women who
      would not dress a la Islamic fashion had received threats from JMJ goons.
      These ruffians had taken laws into their hand while police had asked the
      rural folks to give a helping hand to Bangla Bhai’s force, the JMJ
      goons.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks to all the newspapers published in Bangladesh for bringing the news
      of JMJ cadres’ activities in northwestern districts of Bangladesh.
      Because of the press’ relentless efforts, the U.S. authorities came to
      learn about the lawlessness that was engendered by Islamic hooligans.<br>
      <br>
      That is the reason when U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia,
      Ms. Rocca, called on Industries Minister and ruling coalition partner
      Jamaat-e-Islami, Amir Motiur Rahman Nizami, to convey her concerns about
      the Ahmadiyya issue and Bangla Bhai, who runs a vigilante force against
      outlaws in the northwest reportedly under government patronage, the
      Bangladeshi minister said the most outrageous thing to defend and
      extricate the Jamaat.<br>
      <br>
      Maulana Nizami told one of the newspaper reporters in Dhaka that he
      defended the government ban of Ahmadiyya publications because “the claim
      by Ahmadiyyas as Muslims is not acceptable to Muslims&quot;, since
      “Ahmadiyyas distort Islam.” Being oblivious to repression against
      Hindu and Buddhist minorities since October 2001 the same minister added
      that he assured the US official that there is no religion-based
      confrontation in Bangladesh. What a liar he is!<br>
      <br>
      The same minister of Khaleda Zia told a reporter in Dhaka that when Bangla
      Bhai issue came up during the conversation with Secretary Rocca he blurted
      out, “I told her that neither I nor my party knows this so-called Bangla
      Bhai... I told them that we did not know of the existence of any Islamic
      militant group in Bangladesh.” Is Maulana Nizami suffering from
      Alzheimer disease? Or, is he lying through his teeth? We all read news
      account of a violent confrontation between armed Islamic group, Jama'atul
      Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB), and the police on August 14, 2003, in
      Joypurhat. In that clash, the JMB cadres snatched guns from police and
      that ensued a bloody confrontation resulting in the injury of six
      policemen. Two police officers were reprimanded for negligence in duty.<br>
      <br>
      The police, however, were able to arrest 12-13 JMB men. But because of the
      influence paddling by the Islamist politicians close to Khaleda Zia, the
      PM, all arrested men were released. What a mockery of governance and
      justice! There is a wide belief that Maulana Nizami was instrumental in
      persuading the authority to release the JMB men. Now hardly before a year
      could pass by, Maulana Nizami says that he has no knowledge of Bangla Bhai
      or his force, JMJ. Mind you, the vigilante force of JMJ (of Bangla Bhai)
      is the same force that used to be called JMB. After a bad publicity in the
      press in August 2003, the JMB had mutated the name into JMJ.<br>
      <br>
      It is exactly the same organization, which had a close connection to
      Jamaat-e-Islami. Many experts in Bangladesh had opined that in the
      aftermath of Joypurhat incident JMB was an armed cadre of Hurkat-ul-Jihad
      (HUJ) – a notorious global Islamic outfit. Knowing all this information
      by heart how could Maulana Nizami resort to prevarication of high order.
      Does he think that people will fall for his cooked-up story?<br>
      <br>
      The government of Khaleda Zia knows fully well that inside Bangladesh all
      kinds of virulent Islamists have begun their assault against the secular
      forces. But still they are in the denial a big time. On May 17, 2004,
      several newspapers reported some quite revealing information on JMB (same
      as JMJ) outfit. The armed group is the brainchild of one Maulana Abdur
      Rahman who formed the underground organization in 1998. Maulana Rahman
      went to Saudi Arabia to receive education who later worked in Saudi
      Embassy for many years. There, he must have been indoctrinated to Wahhabi
      teachings and ultimately to the cause of Jihad. It is hardly a coincidence
      that assault on secular organizations and minority’s house of worship
      had started right after the formation of JMB.<br>
      <br>
      The first two bombs rocked the town of Jessore on March 6, 1999, killing
      10 people attending a cultural soiree hosted by Udichi, the cultural wing
      of Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) in Jessore. Is it coincidental that
      the same virulent Islamic group is now hunting CPB armed cadre in the
      western districts.<br>
      <br>
      The industry minister of Bangladesh, Maulana Nizami, should stop lying
      through his teeth. He is pretending to know nothing about the identity of
      Bangla Bhai’s marauding group. Both he and Khaleda Zia know the very
      identity of various Islamic goons operating in Bangladesh with their
      blessings. The present government is soft on Islamic groups that are
      waging Jihad on communists and other secularists. It is an ideological
      war, undoubtedly. Unfortunately, the police have taken side already.<br>
      <br>
      Just the other day the JMJ cadres and their commander, Bangla Bhai, went
      underground after police had alerted them to lie low. Even then, Bangla
      Bhai went to visit one of his fallen jihadists who were recuperating from
      an injury in the government-run hospital in a nearby town under the
      watchful eyes of the police. So what in the world is going on?<br>
      <br>
      The bottom line is that the police perhaps under order from Khaleda Zia
      Administration are helping the jihadi brigade to go underground. Instead
      of arresting, the police were helping them. To add insult to injury, the
      police said that no arrest order had come from Home Ministry. On top of
      it, the Industry Minister who himself is an Islamist of high order lied
      through his teeth to Secretary Rocca telling her that he (the government)
      had the slightest clue who these Islamic goons were.<br>
      <br>
      In his heart, Nizami knows very well that Bangla Bhai’s organization,
      Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh (JMB), had mutated its name into Jagrata
      Muslim Janata (JMJ). Soon we will hear from the Prime Minister who will
      also give us her usual song and dance telling the newspaper reporters that
      the identity of Bangla Bhai’s organization was not known to her until
      very recently. When will this litany of lies from government stop? I for
      one have no clues.<br>
