	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">Slowly but surely, <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> has 
	become the proverbial ‘Banana Republic’ under the aegis of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
	military.&nbsp; A week after the installation of the second and consecutive 
	caretaker government by defying the dictums of the constitution, I wrote an 
	article on January 17, which was published on January 19 in 
<ST1>Dhaka</ST1>’s premier newspaper, Daily Star.&nbsp; In that article I wrote quite 
	succinctly that the newly formed government was indeed a military-backed 
	one.&nbsp; To my knowledge, I was the first among myriad writers to give label to 
	Fakhruddin Administration calling it a military-backed oligarchy.&nbsp; Most 
	newspapers both inside and out newspaper followed my characterization and 
	they all ubiquitously call it a military-backed or military-driven 
	government.<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">
	<O></O>If anyone doubts my assertion, I ask that reader to watch how General 
	Moeen Ahmed conducts business in various public functions.&nbsp; The military 
	leader wasted no time to promote him to the position of a four-star General 
	and both the president and the chief advisor went along with the misguided 
	proposal to promote not only the army General but also the other two chiefs 
	of the Naval and Air Force.&nbsp; You talk about undue advantage taken by the 
	armed services!&nbsp; When ordinary citizens are working extra hard to eke out a 
	living, the top military brasses found it very convenient to indulge in 
	self-promotion.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">The <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> army learnt their 
	lesson very well from Pakistani army, which too often comes up with a 
	shining example to be emulated by <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> military.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	Pakistani army generously gave residential plots to retired officers and 
	very quickly <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> army followed that route.&nbsp; Now Dhaka 
	flaunts DOHS (ex-army’s residential township), just like 
<ST1>Lahore</ST1>, Malir Cantonment Area DOHS in <ST1>Pakistan</ST1>).&nbsp; They 
	even copied the name <i>in toto</i> from their previous masters. &nbsp;&nbsp;<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">
	<O></O>Another glaring example of following the Pakistani military’s move is 
	worth mentioning here. After taking power in October 1999 General Mushharaf 
	sent both the deposed PM, Mian Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League (PML), 
	and his rival, Benazir Bhutto, who was the chief opposition politician 
	belonging to Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) to Middle East in forced exile.&nbsp; <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1>’s military-backed government also tried that route to send 
	both Hasina and Khaleda to exile but because of outside pressure the 
	Fakhruddin Administration backed down.&nbsp; This failure of the interim 
	government to send the two politicians abroad in forced exile was not taken 
	lightly.&nbsp; Sheikh Hasina was framed in quite a few trumped up charges of 
	bribery.&nbsp; The amount of money alleged to be taken by Hasina was puny as 
	compared the money amassed by Khaleda Zia’s two sons.&nbsp; But this does not 
	disturb the equanimity of Mainul Husein or Moeen Ahmed, the two protagonists 
	who are at the forefront of this government whose term-limit of 90 days have 
	long been gone.&nbsp; To justify the existence of this government Mainul Husein 
	mentions every time he gets the microphone that this interim government is a 
	constitutional government.&nbsp; This must be a prick in their conscience or 
	else, why does he or Gen. Moeen talks about the constitutionality of this 
	government umpteenth times?<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<O></O><font face="Times New Roman">Let me now touch on more relevant 
	matters.&nbsp; Sheikh Hasina had been languishing in a sub jail in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1> 
	since June 16, 2007.&nbsp; Nearly sixty days after her arrest by the 
	military-backed government, there was an uprise among students and ordinary 
	people allover 
<ST1>Dhaka</ST1> and other districts.&nbsp; The <ST1>Dhaka University</ST1> students 
	were not protesting on behalf of Hasina or her party, Awami League.&nbsp; It was 
	a very mundane issue – some students were roughed up by military stationed 
	inside the campus.&nbsp; The students wanted the army camp stationed in the 
	campus demolish and soldiers taken out.&nbsp; However, outsiders took to the 
	streets in sympathy of the students and soon the mass demonstration was 
	transformed into an anti-interim government movement.&nbsp; The whole thing 
	developed rather extemporaneously.&nbsp; This continued for three days and the 
	short-lived movement spread to other cities.&nbsp; The military-backed government 
	panicked, took defensive measure, and declared day-long curfew to quell the 
	newly minted movement, which they did by mobilizing army and by instituting 
	day-to-dawn curfew.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<O></O><font face="Times New Roman">After crushing the mass movement the 
	military-driven government ordered the police to find the protesters.&nbsp; Cases 
	were filed against an estimated 100,000 people.&nbsp; How many people were 
	arrested?&nbsp; That we don’t know.&nbsp; Parenthetically, it is noteworthy that the 
	prison system in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> is bursting at the seam where 250,000 
	people or more are languishing without any charges against them.&nbsp; Since 
	interim government came to power and thanks to army for that, the 
	administration arrested tens and thousands of ordinary people who they 
	thought will be troublemakers.&nbsp; On top of this, the government is planning 
	on arresting another 80,000-90,000 people on new charges.&nbsp; It remains to be 
	seen if it is merely an empty talk or they mean business.<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<O></O><font face="Times New Roman">The spokesperson for the government, 
	Mainul Husein, had mentioned it to the press in recent days that the 
	government is experiencing a rough time at this time.&nbsp; This was exacerbated 
	by the arrest of 5 senior professors, 2 from <ST1>Dhaka</ST1> <ST1>
	University</ST1> and 3 from 
<ST1>Rajshahi University</ST1>.&nbsp; No sooner the news of the arrest of university 
	professors were made public, sympathy started to pour in favor of the 
	arrested teacher.&nbsp; The government came out with a black eye.&nbsp; Many overseas 
	Bangladeshis showed their collective disdain by buzzing the Internet with 
	protest notes and floating e-petition forwarding them to U.N. Secretary 
	General, powerful lawmakers in 
<ST1>America</ST1>, <ST1>Great Britain</ST1>, and EU.&nbsp; This news is not confined 
	to the West but made it to <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>; thanks to the blazing speed of 
	the Internet.&nbsp; The government is naturally perturbed by all this negative 
	campaign.&nbsp; Therefore, they had to resort to a ‘Red Herring’ to bring an end 
	to all the e-petitions. 
<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<O></O><font face="Times New Roman">In my humble judgment, Khaleda Zia and 
	her son, Arafat Rahman Coco’s arrest on September 3, 2007 is a classic ‘Red 
	Herring.’&nbsp; The government that became the villain due to student uprising 
	and subsequent arrests of the five professors saw how many negative 
	editorial write-ups graced the pages of newspapers allover <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; 
	They simply had to do the damage control.&nbsp; And in their desperation they 
	came up with a ‘conspiracy against the nation’ theory.&nbsp; <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
	big neighbor was not named as a co-conspirator but it was mentioned in a 
	vernacular newspaper close to the military-backed government that a 
	freelance reported and civil rights advocate for minority had just returned 
	from <ST1>India</ST1> where he met Pranab Mukherjee and RAW higher-ups.&nbsp; The 
	activist in question had received crores of money to stage anti-government 
	protest sessions.&nbsp; The government could easily arrest this person but they 
	fear backlash because he has established a network for fellow civil rights 
	activists in the West.&nbsp; If he is arrested by the government, a deluge of 
	anti-military-backed government PR campaign will start in earnest.&nbsp; 
	Fakhruddin-Mainul-Moeen may do their saber-rattling inside 
<ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> but they have no lobby outside <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> to 
	thwart the PR campaign to malign this temporary government.&nbsp; Mainul Husein 
	and his fellow oligarchs know it too well.&nbsp; That is precisely why they are 
	not arresting the Bangladeshi civil rights activists.&nbsp; This precisely brings 
	to the next question – what next?<O></O></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">
	<O></O>The military-backed government of Fakhruddin is a stunt master par 
	excellence. It knows when to strike.&nbsp; This time they have decided to pull 
	one of their stunt and they did it in a short notice.&nbsp; They executed rather 
	flawlessly the much anticipated arrest of Khaleda Zia.&nbsp; In my book it is a 
	classic ‘Red Herring.’&nbsp; Both media and public interest will be on the news; 
	consequently, the campaign against government’s misguided decision to arrest 
	the five senior most professors will be on the wane.&nbsp; Therefore, I suspect 
	that the arrest of the mother and son was speeded up to digress and divert 
	the media’s focus from DU related trouble that haunts the triumvirate 
	powerhouse in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>.&nbsp; The masses will be happy to see that the 
	government means business.&nbsp; Not to mention this will hasten the destruction 
	of BNP as a political force, which the military had supported since 1991.&nbsp; 
	Khaleda Zia was trusted by the both the Generals and rank-in-file, equally.&nbsp; 
	But since the party and leadership were mired in corruption, the cantonment 
	crowd had withdrawn their support, which led to the fall of Khaleda Zia and 
	her two sons from grace. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman">In summary, I was soul searching for the 
	reasons to arrest Khaleda Zia by the military-backed government and I 
	discussed the motivating factors for her arrest by the power seating in the 
	catbird seat in Dhaka.&nbsp; The government may say that they are merely doing a 
	balancing act and to this I say humbug.&nbsp; The real threat that may shake the 
	foundation of this temporary government is the campus politics.&nbsp; The 
	government made a fool out of itself by arresting five professors.&nbsp; To 
	divert the attention from this growing trouble and a stop to developing 
	inimical voice among intelligentsia, the government arrested Khaleda Zia and 
	her son pronto.&nbsp; It remains to be seen how the arrest of the botox queen of <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1> plays out in hastening the demise of BNP.&nbsp; Will the news of 
	the prodigious arrest generate enough interest in media to make the 
	intelligentsia forget the plights of five university professors in the hands 
	of military-led joint forces?&nbsp; We shall have to keep our eyes fixed on the 
	oligarchs who have become far too powerful in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> since 
	January 12, 2007.&nbsp; Then, wasn’t Khaleda Zia very powerful in the last 
	fifteen years? &nbsp;</font></p>
