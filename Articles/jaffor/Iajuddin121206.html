	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whenever one talks about a looming 
	political crisis in Bangladesh one thinks about one of the two major 
	political parties, namely Awami League (AL) the party that made Bangladesh a 
	free nation and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the party that is bent 
	on Pakistanization of Bangladesh is the root cause of the problem. But when 
	someone tells you that a lone retired soil science professor, who became the 
	president of this 145 million people through the courtesy of Khaleda Zia, is 
	the mischief-maker, then a knowledgeable person from the land would 
	pooh-pooh the notion. Contrary to what you may think this is the reality. 
	Make no mistake about it that Iajuddin being the puppet in the hands of BNP 
	high commands has contributed to this new crisis, which may cause a great 
	harm to the nation we lovingly call the Sonar Bangla. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I have mentioned already, 
	Bangladesh is now facing a monumental crisis, politically speaking of 
	course. In late October 2006, the five-year term for BNP-led government came 
	to an ignominious end. As per the constitution of the land, a neutral 
	caretaker government headed by a chief advisor (CA) and ten members or 
	advisors should be in place to conduct a free and fair election to pave the 
	way for a new administration. The departing ruling party (BNP) by juggling 
	the retirements of a few justices made sure that a person who is sympathetic 
	to their party would become the CA of the caretaker government. They also 
	appointed a few election commissioners who would toe the party line to 
	ensure a BNP victory in the next election. The AL and other opposition 
	parties in Bangladesh had been saying all along that the Election Commission 
	should be recast to make a level playing field so that every political party 
	is on equal footing entering the election process. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the last week of October 2006 
	Bangladesh faced a mini crisis on the issue of electing a Chief Advisor of 
	the much anticipated caretaker government. The leading candidate who was 
	favored by BNP withdrew his nomination buckled under political pressure from 
	the opposition. The president, Iajuddin Ahmed, did the unthinkable. Instead 
	of appointing the next person in line who is also a retired justice of the 
	Supreme Court he appointed himself to be the next CA of the caretaker 
	government. Reluctantly, the opposition agreed to the proposal made by 
	Iajuddin but they said that the president should show his neutrality while 
	managing the next caretaker administration. Next, a ten-member advisory 
	committee was formed in a hurry who are from civil society and nonpartisan. 
	Thus, the caretaker government had only one partisan member but the trouble 
	was that he made sure that most powerful portfolios stay with him. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To have Iajuddin as the Chief 
	Advisor of the caretaker government was a disaster from day one. The 
	opposition parties were demonstrating in the streets allover the nation to 
	place their demands to block the appointment of the leading candidate for 
	the position of CA of the caretaker government and to reform the Election 
	Commission. Blinded by his love for BNP he wanted to deploy army to squish 
	the demonstration called on by the opposition. The newly appointed advisors 
	showed their annoyance to this move by the president. He rescinded his order 
	to post army in the street under pressure from the new advisors. From day 
	one Iajuddin was toeing his party line and he wanted to crush the 
	opposition’s protest programs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another thing was quite discernible. 
	Iajuddin was in no mood to consult the 10-member advisors on issues that 
	have bearing on the upcoming election. The essence of the caretaker 
	government is to make a favorable climate for a fair and free election. 
	Iajuddin was doing just the opposite. To show that he is omnipotent when it 
	comes to governance, he mistakenly thought that the nation is now under the 
	presidential rule. It was far from being true. The constitution allowed the 
	president to become the CA of the caretaker government despite some expert 
	opinion that his ascension to the new position was unconstitutional for he 
	did not follow the procedure outline in the constitution. When it was 
	explained to him that he was wearing two hats and the real power lies with 
	the CA of the caretaker government, he then understood where he erred. 
	Iajuddin proved one thing for sure – people can still learn when they are 
	old! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The main opposition party, the Awami 
	League, and its 14-party alliance still pressed hard for Election Commission 
	reform and they in consultation of the advisory council of the caretaker 
	government came out with a 'package deal' agreeable to all parties including 
	BNP. But in the final hour Iajuddin would not go along with it. He adamantly 
	refused to let go one Election Commissioner. Bangladesh again plunged into a 
	crisis and one could squarely blame it on Iajuddin because he was again 
	toeing the party line. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On December 9, 2006 the crisis 
	deepened a further when Iajuddin called the army to man the streets of Dhaka 
	and elsewhere when his trusted advisors advised him to the contrary. A day 
	later on December 10, 2006 four advisors of the ten-member team who were in 
	the office for only 43 days tendered their resignation. The bottom-line was 
	that they all thought they were ineffective in shaping up the policy to make 
	a favorable environment for a fair and free election. Iajuddin is asking the 
	four advisors to reconsider their decision to resign from the caretaker 
	government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The resignation of the four advisors 
	took everyone in Bangladesh by surprise. These advisors were repeatedly 
	hinting that Iajuddin was not listening to them and he has become a despot 
	when it comes to making decision on key issues. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The chief of Awami League, Sheikh 
	Hasina, sounded the alarm bell when she said that her party may boycott the 
	election. Her reasoning is that Iajuddin is working to benefit only one 
	party (BNP) and when the advisors are trying to make an environment for fair 
	and free election Iajuddin is doing just the opposite while making others in 
	the caretaker government very uncomfortable.. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the hindsight Hasina made a 
	mistake in late October when Iajuddin declared himself to be the CA to 
	caretaker government. At the time the opposition gave a benefit of doubt to 
	Iajuddin and thought that he would take a neutral stance as far as the next 
	election goes. But the events of the last 43 days have proved that a party 
	man like Iajuddin is beyond any reform. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a perspective on Iajuddin let me 
	state that he was a very mediocre academic who did his doctoral degree in 
	early sixties and vegetated in the campus of Dhaka University since then. In 
	late 1970 and early 1980s he became a vocal champion of Gen. Ziaur Rahman, 
	the founder of BNP, while being a full professor of the soil science 
	department. With the help of BNP he held some important position at DU and 
	in the government until he retired from the job. When Khaleda Zia booted out 
	her first choice of the president of Bangladesh, Badruddozza Chowdhury, in 
	2002 because he would not toe the party line, she replaced him with Iajuddin 
	who was not known beyond the four walls of Dhaka University. Khaleda Zia is 
	elated now knowing how subservient this person is. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I chanced to read a few editorials 
	from Dhaka’s newspapers on December 10, 2006 and most of them are very 
	negative about Iajuddin's performance as the CA of the caretaker government. 
	One editorial even mentioned that his midnight address to the nation on 
	December 9 seems like it was prepared by the BNP in which he squarely blamed 
	Awami League for fomenting the trouble. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iajuddin still does not know that he 
	is not the part of the solution but part of the problem. He lost his 
	credibility and with his stubbornness while taking the nation to a spiraling 
	downward journey. Bangladesh is facing a crisis already and there is this 
	chance that the opposition may boycott the election in January 2007. It 
	really took one person to make a mess of monumental proportion. Iajuddin 
	became so blinded by his love for BNP that he breached the first rule of 
	being the caretaker government – “Thou shalt be neutral.” Who is going to 
	tell this Alzheimeric person that he ought to be neutral if he wants to be 
	the CA of the caretaker government? With a person like him at the helm 
	Bangladesh hardly needs an enemy to destroy the democratic norm in this 
	impoverished nation of 145 million teeming masses. </font></p>
