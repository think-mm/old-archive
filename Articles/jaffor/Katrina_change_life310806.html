	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My conspicuous absence from the 
	cyber world for the last 8 weeks was caused by my return to New Orleans. My 
	home had no telephone service, never mind the broadband Internet service. 
	Thus, I was disconnected from the rest of the world as Israel fought with 
	Hezbollah guerrillas inside Lebanon for weeks and the British authorities 
	made such a fuss about some errant Pakistani Brits who Pakistani authorities 
	thought were out there to blow up planes in midair. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I got back from Cornell campus on 
	July 10, 2006 to report to New Orleans to my workplace. The infrastructure 
	of New Orleans was destroyed by the hurricane Katrina. A big part of the 
	city is still inhabitable. It is like a ghost town. My hometown, Slidell, is 
	a northeastern suburb, which is coming back to life. I hired some 
	construction people to rebuild my home. It turned out that they were a bunch 
	of crook who took some advance money from me but did not finish the work. I 
	ended up doing the unfinished work â€“ tile work, carpentry, plumbing, and a 
	lot more. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My telephone company, Bellsouth, 
	established the phone line only two days ago. The DSL modem came to my 
	doorsteps just today. Thus, I was able to reconnect to the cyber world.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I just realized that hurricane 
	Katrina struck my city exactly a year ago. My life was turned upside down by 
	the killer hurricane. I lost all my material possession. The ghost-like 
	house was still standing tall with a tattered roof. Literally, we became 
	homeless. Like an itinerant we moved aimlessly from city to city. We somehow 
	ended up in Atlanta by the middle of September 2005. And from there, I went 
	to the Cornell campus with my daughter while my wife returned to our home 
	with my eldest son who is a grad student at Yale. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A year had passed by and things have 
	changed for the better for my family. I spent 9 months at the campus leaving 
	behind half a dozen grad students who still maintain communication with me. 
	My daughter had attended high school in Ithaca and my wife served as a 
	substitute teacher over there. My second son, Riaz, had finished his 
	difficult first year at Georgia Tech in Atlanta while my eldest son, Rashad, 
	went to Kolkata from Yale to study Bangla receiving a scholarship from U.S. 
	State Department-sponsored program administered by the University of 
	Chicago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have seen human foibles in Red 
	Cross shelters where I spent some time as the hurricane raged through 
	Louisiana and Mississippi. I saw adults crying without knowing where they 
	are headed in the aftermath of the hurricane. Those dark days are gone but 
	many hurricane survivors are still in a rut. An entire section of New 
	Orleans looks like a war zone. One could drive miles after miles in Eastern 
	New Orleans where there are empty buildings still standing tall but no 
	people could be found. And gone are the hustles and bustles of shopping 
	malls. The main public university of New Orleans has resumed its classes 
	with a limited number of students and faculties. The same is true for other 
	places of learning. Now it takes far less time for me to drive 28 miles from 
	my home to my place of work. Sometime as I am driving, I ponder what had 
	happened to all those people. One could see the lawns of the deserted homes 
	taken over by weeds and grasses. There is no sign that the owners are coming 
	back to reclaim their properties anytime soon. While the mayor of New 
	Orleans is very upbeat as he makes his prediction about the future of this 
	city, the ground reality is very different. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I learned a very valuable lesson 
	from the hurricane. I always felt that bad things happen to other people. 
	But I learned my hard lesson. We, the humankinds, are very weak and helpless 
	as compared to various destructive forces of Mother Nature. When 
	earthquakes, tsunami, cyclonic storm, massive floods strike a region, many 
	people needlessly die. Our orb is inhabited by 6.25 billion people and each 
	year if a fraction of worldâ€™s population face starvation or become 
	homeless due to ongoing war, disease, or natural disaster, and then many 
	lives are impacted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We are however glad to be alive. My 
	family members have gone through a lot. We have seen many wan faces of 
	adversities. Life is a struggle here. Still many people in my area go to 
	Church run help center to get a morsel of food. But life goes on. Let us 
	hope that many people who are financially devastated and who lost their 
	dwellings will be able to rebuild their life. Because it is far easier to 
	restart life in an impoverished nation than it is in the land of Dolce Vita.</font></p>
