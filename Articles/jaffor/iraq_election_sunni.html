  <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="verdana">The election for 
	Iraq’s parliament is slated for January 30, 2005, which is only two weeks 
	from now and it is quite uncertain whether the election will be free of 
	violence or whether the majority of the Sunnis will boycott the election.&nbsp; 
	If a handful of Sunni candidates run from the ‘Sunni Triangle’, they may be 
	elected but won’t share power with the dominant Shia parliamentarians.&nbsp; The 
	Sunnis who were accustomed to be in power for decades because they 
	controlled the ruling Baath Party now realizes that their heydays are gone 
	and going forward they will remain as a minority power in Iraq.&nbsp; This 
	baleful thought is causing concern among Sunni leaders and their followers.&nbsp; 
	What are they going to do about it?&nbsp; Is there any formula through which they 
	could share power with the dominant Shia politicians from the rest of the 
	country?&nbsp; For some thoughts on this, please peruse the rest of this article.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad news 
	travels fast.&nbsp; U.S. and Iraqi officials will not guarantee Iraq’s restive 
	Sunnis in the ‘Golden Triangle’ a share of power when the future Iraqi 
	parliament convenes.&nbsp; This decision by U.S. and Iraqi officials threatens to 
	make matters worse in the ‘Sunni Triangle’ as ethnic strife may intensify 
	only to mar the legitimacy of Iraq’s next elected government.<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Violence in 
	Iraq has already intensified weeks before the planned parliamentarian 
	election of January 30, 2005.&nbsp; A day earlier, gunmen killed a representative 
	of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most senior and revered Shiite 
	Muslim cleric, along with the aide’s son and four bodyguards in a town south 
	of Baghdad, which is inside the ‘Sunni Triangle’.&nbsp; This should be indicative 
	of who did the killing.&nbsp; The Sunni gunmen wanted to send a chilling message 
	to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurgents are 
	now desperate to foil Iraq’s upcoming elections.&nbsp; By assassinating the head 
	Shiite clergy’s aid and others from Shiite community appears to deliver a 
	message to al-Sistani, who strongly supports the election.&nbsp; Recently, we 
	also read that the Sunni insurgents have targeted electoral workers and 
	candidates.&nbsp; The insurgents want an absolute chaos in Iraq right before the 
	election.&nbsp; In a bid to draw attention from international news organizations 
	they carried out today (January 13, 2005) a kidnapping operation in central 
	Baghdad; in the process they killed six Iraqis while abducting a Turkish 
	businessman, who reportedly ran a construction company aiding the U.S.-led 
	occupation authorities. <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it that 
	the Sunnis in ‘Golden Triangle’ are so upset about the hosting of January 30 
	elections?&nbsp; The election math scares the hell out of them.&nbsp; You see, Shiites 
	make up 60 percent of Iraq's 26 million people and are expected to dominate 
	the 275-member National Assembly in the first free elections held in Iraq 
	since it became independent in 1932.&nbsp; As I have pointed it out earlier, some 
	Sunnis, who are 20 percent of the population, fear a loss of the dominance 
	and privilege they enjoyed for decades under Baathist regimes.&nbsp; Therefore, 
	it comes as no surprise that Sunni clerics have called for an all out 
	boycott.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; I read today in 
	the Wall Street Journal a pre-election analysis of the ground reality in 
	Iraq.&nbsp; According to the journal, an internal U.S. estimate indicates that 
	the Sunnis are likely to fare very poorly in the elections.&nbsp; With violence 
	escalating in the Sunni belt, many residents (read Sunnis) will opt not to 
	cast their votes because of anger at the U.S.&nbsp; An estimate by the U.S. 
	officials put the number of parliamentary seats to be won by the Sunnis at 
	6%, a figure well below 20%, which should be the correct figure if most 
	Sunnis go to the poll.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence 
	of such dismal showing in the next election by the Sunni politicians would 
	mean that the country’s Shiite majority who account for 60% of the 
	population would disproportionately dominate Iraq’s next government.&nbsp; The 
	decision by the Sunnis to remain absent from the election would give the 
	Shiites extra seats in the parliament.&nbsp; The U.S. and Iraqi officials ruled 
	out guaranteeing Sunni representation in the parliament.&nbsp; In other words, 
	there will be no quota system for any ethnic group.&nbsp; This policy will favor 
	the Shiites.&nbsp; It is a small wonder that Ali-al-Sistani is ecstatic about 
	this election and he is asking the authorities not to delay the election.<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, U.S. 
	and Iraqi authorities thought that Sunnis should be given a stake in Iraq’s 
	next government even if it means handing them a few extra parliamentary 
	seats.&nbsp; However, this idea of guaranteeing Sunni representation in the 
	parliament was ruled out because such move would run counter to the idea of 
	forming the next government through democracy.&nbsp; Besides, this would violate 
	Iraq’s temporary constitution.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision of 
	not guaranteeing Sunni representation came amidst “an array of problems 
	threatening the planned balloting of for a 275-person national assembly 
	charged with governing the country while drafting a permanent constitution,” 
	as the WSJ reporter wrote in his article.<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Iraq’s Sunnis 
	know it fully well that in any election that is based on “one-person one 
	vote,” they cannot have majority in the parliament.&nbsp; Thus, Sunni militants 
	took to the street from early 2004.&nbsp; The Sunni-led violence has escalated so 
	much so that interim Iraqi Prime minister, Ayad Allawi, had said in early 
	January 2005 that several predominantly Sunni areas of the country would be 
	too dangerous for Iraqis to cast their ballots on January 30 election.&nbsp; The 
	Sunni clerics also realized that by now, Ali al-Sistani’s followers would be 
	in the catbird seat of power in Baghdad.&nbsp; Thus, they also gave their clarion 
	call for boycotting the January 30 election.&nbsp; On top of it, Iraq’s largest 
	Sunni political party has decided to pull out of the race. &nbsp;Since the Sunnis 
	of Iraq saw the proverbial writings on the wall, they decided to be no part 
	of this election.&nbsp; Nonetheless, U.S. and interim Iraqi government have 
	decided to conduct this election rain or shine.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this dire 
	backdrop (for Sunnis), many Sunnis including two politicians have demanded 
	that the election be delayed for a minimum of six months to improve the law 
	and order situation in the Sunni belt.&nbsp; This extra time will allow the Sunni 
	leaders to persuade their people to participate in the voting process.&nbsp; 
	Several members of Mr. Allawi’s government and some Kurdish leaders echoed 
	this sentiment.&nbsp; However, Shiites clergies including the grand Ayatollah of 
	Iraq want the election to go through on January 30, 2005.&nbsp; The Bush 
	Administration also wants to see the election held on the scheduled date for 
	it said that delaying the vote would hand a victory to the Sunni insurgents; 
	this delay would trigger more violence.<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of 
	how to deal with Iraq’s Sunni minority is one of the thorniest and 
	complicated issues faced by U.S. and Iraqi policymakers.&nbsp; In the last four 
	decades, the minority Sunni leaders controlled every aspect of Iraqi life.&nbsp; 
	Saddam Hussein along with many Baath party leaders had monopolized all 
	economical and political power in Iraq.&nbsp; Saddam’s army had officers from 
	Sunni sect while the foot soldiers were recruited from Shia communities.&nbsp; 
	The Sunnis from ‘Golden Triangle’ had the arrogance of being the masters and 
	they are dreading about becoming powerless under the Shiite dominated 
	government.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunnis have 
	been hesitant to join the election process for they fear that their newfound 
	minority status will be formalized and it will remain so as long as the 
	Shiites could form the government year after year.&nbsp; The U.S. planners have 
	no idea how to work out a formula to remove the genuine apprehension that is 
	in the minds of Sunni folks.&nbsp; This inability by the U.S. administration to 
	work a plan to include Sunnis in the power structure is causing a concern 
	amongst not only Sunni intellectuals but also U.S. experts on Iraq.&nbsp; Mr. 
	Larry Diamond of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution who served in the 
	U.S. occupation authority in 2004 said, “The ongoing exclusion of Sunnis 
	from the decision-making process in Iraq will further polarize and inflame 
	the situation, increase their sense of marginalization, and potentially 
	grease the slide towards civil war.&nbsp; It is one thing to tell Sunnis they 
	won’t rule the country anymore, but it is another to say they won’t even 
	have a seat at the table.”<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; A handful of 
	Sunni politicians will win in the election.&nbsp; These Sunni politicians have 
	aligned with political parties controlled by Shiite politicians.&nbsp; If all 
	Sunnis would have voted from the ‘Golden Triangle’, they would secure 55 
	seats but under this dismal scenario of boycott by the Sunnis, they might 
	capture only 15 to 30 seats.&nbsp; U.S. expects the Shiite run government would 
	offer important cabinet positions to Sunnis and allow them to join the 
	committee that will draft the future constitution.&nbsp; The other possibility 
	would be appointing ministers from Sunni communities even they have not been 
	elected to the national assembly.&nbsp; In short, everyone wants to see more 
	participation by the Sunni politicians at the national level.&nbsp; However, the 
	ground reality will put a roadblock to it.&nbsp; Under this scenario, more 
	violence will erupt in Iraq in post election days and country may head for a 
	protracted civil war.<O></O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the 
	much talked about national election in Iraq is only two weeks away but the 
	Sunnis have no guarantee of sharing power at the center.&nbsp; U.S. and interim 
	Iraqi government have not come up with the idea to reserve seats for the 
	Sunnis in the parliament fearing that doing so would violate the democratic 
	process.&nbsp; The Sunnis are expected to win only 15-30 seats out of 275 
	parliamentary seats.&nbsp; That is precisely the reason many Sunnis would boycott 
	the election.&nbsp; The Shiites on the other hand would like to see that the 
	election is held on January 30, 2005.&nbsp; After years of subjugation by the 
	minority sect, this is the first opportunity Shiites would have to govern 
	the nation.&nbsp; It is a small wonder that the grand Ayatollah of Iraq, Ali-al-Sistani, 
	warned the U.S. not to delay the election.&nbsp; It remains to be seen whether 
	the insurgency-led civil war intensifies after the election in the event 
	majority of the Sunnis abstain from casting their ballots.&nbsp; Therefore, stay 
	tuned because more is yet to come.<O></O></font></p>
