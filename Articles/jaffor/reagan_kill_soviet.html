  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Various Internet forums are abuzz with Ronald W.
  Reagan and his contributions to America and the world. Many writers who hardly
  lived in America during the time Reagan was president for eight long years are
  now telling us that the 40th president was instrumental in killing the Soviet
  system of governance. In other words Reagan’s policy of
  ‘get-tough-with-Russians’ had resulted in the fragmentation of the Soviet
  bloc. This is simply a naïveté on the part of the new writers who are so
  eager to give Ronald Reagan all the credit for the dismantling of the Soviet
  bloc. The truth, however, is that Soviet bloc imploded because of economic
  strain. The reform to dismantle the age-old economic system was engendered
  from within.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">In the waning days of Leonid Brezhnev as president of
  Soviet Russia (1980-82) many academicians in Russia saw the writings on the
  wall. Clearly Russians were spending a big chunk of the national budget on
  military and space exploration. The strain of the Cold War on economy was
  quite visible. Therefore, when Brezhnev died while still in the office many an
  academic and members of think-tank institute in Russian were coming to terms
  with the economic stagnation that plagued the nation at the time. Many were
  questioning the benefit of sending army to Afghanistan as a part of the &quot;Brezhnev
  Doctrine&quot; in 1977, which was dubbed by Russian intellectuals as
  &quot;Russia’s Vietnam&quot; with an obvious reference to America’s
  experience in Vietnam. In the next three years after Brezhnev’s death in
  1982, Russians have selected 2 leaders to lead their nation. But these two
  aged politburo members were simply the remnants from Brezhnev era. Only in
  1985 Mikhail Gorbachev was chosen by the Russian politburo to not only run the
  government but to usher in the dismantling of what the world then knew as the
  Soviet Union. And believe me, Ronald Reagan had very little to do about it
  notwithstanding his imprecation for the country.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">In this article I will extensively cite the work of
  Pulitzer Prize winner reporter of NY Times, Mr. Hedrick Smith who wrote such
  remarkable books on Soviet Union as &quot;The Russians,&quot; &quot;The Power
  Game,&quot; and &quot;The New Russians.&quot; Mr. Smith contends that it was
  Mikhail Gorbachev who set free the process of perestroika, which ultimately
  led to the success of the process of reform. This homebrewed reform did the
  Soviet in. Let me cite some excerpts from Mr. Smith’s book &quot;The New
  Russians&quot; to point out that Mr. Ronald Reagan played an insignificant
  role in the process that led to the break up of Soviet Union.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Mr. Smith wrote as a way of introduction the
  following:</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">&quot;For Americans, Reagan’s venture to the Kremlin
  was big news. His strolls on Red Square with Gorbachev, his luncheon for
  Moscow dissidents, his speech to university students, all made great
  television soap opera: the old Cold Warrior playing in the heart of &quot;the
  evil empire.&quot;&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">&quot;But the Russians I talked with then were blasé
  about the summit. They saw Reagan’s visit as a sideshow; the much more
  compelling battle was the one within their own country, over internal change.
  Its outcome that May was most uncertain. The Russians knew that Reagan’s
  coming was important for Soviet-American relations, but it stirred no real
  excitement. They were glad for his courtesy call, especially after all the
  harsh things he (Reagan) had said about them, and they were polite to the
  president for a few days. But they could hardly wait for him to get out of
  town, so they could get back to their own unfolding political brawl, a
  struggle over their national destiny.&quot; [&quot;The New Russian&quot;;
  Hedrick Smith, 1990]</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Mr. Smith wrote the above excerpted material in the
  introductory section of his book &quot;The New Russian.&quot; Clearly, the
  second Russian Revolution started with Gorbachev’s <i>perestroika</i>. Mr.
  Reagan or his much touted Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) had very little
  to do with the impending dismantling of Soviet Union. A long time ago (most
  likely in the 1990s) I read a biography on Mikhail Gorbachev in which it was
  mentioned that a white paper written by a team of academicians on Soviet
  Union’s impending economic disaster had correctly predicted that their
  nation would go bankrupt if the government keeps on building nuclear arsenals,
  sends missions to outer space, supports vessel nations such as Cuba and other
  Eastern European nations belonging to the Soviet bloc. Prominent among the
  academicians was Ms. Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist, whose name had been
  mentioned as one of the intellectuals who were very critical of the way the
  Soviet Union was conducting their foreign and economic policies. Mr. Gorbachev
  was given a copy of the white paper written by Ms. Zaslavskaya and her
  colleagues long before he took charge of the Kremlin. Come to think of it, Mr.
  Gorbachev was the chief of much dreaded Soviet establishment, the KGB.</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Therefore, it is safe to say that Mr. Gorbachev’s <i>perestroika</i>
  was influenced by the Soviet intellectuals. Mr. Reagan or any other U.S.
  politician did not play any role in putting the Soviet in the path of
  self-implosion. All the tough talk from Mr. Reagan could hardly have a ripple
  effect on up coming <i>perestroika</i>. It is only the Reaganites in America
  who believed in such a thing call &quot;Reagan’s tough talk&quot; to Soviet
  leaders had led to the dismemberment of Soviet bloc and the &quot;evil
  empire.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="verdana">Two things that helped Mr. Gorbachev to dismantle the
  Soviet Union were <i>perestroika</i> and <i>glasnost </i>(openness). Needless
  to say, both were homebrewed - a Russian thing. American press especially the
  ones that are conservative (such as the Wall Street Journal) should stop
  blabbering about the role (?) Ronald Reagan played in the dismantling of
  Russia’s &quot;evil empire.&quot; Truth should be told no matter what.
  History will treat Mr. Reagan correctly. Mr. Gorbachev did not win the
  popularity contest in the aftermath of 1991 upheaval in the former Soviet
  Union. But his place in history is assured. Therefore, if we have to point
  finger at someone for the demise of Communist Russia, you now know who would
  be that person. All the hoopla about Ronald Reagan would die down within a
  month or so. And with it will die all the falsehood that claims that President
  Reagan killed the Soviet Union. The claim is a prevarication of high order in
  my humble opinion.</font></p>
