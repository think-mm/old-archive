											<font face="Verdana">The newscasters 
											in America had a reason for 
											celebration.&nbsp; On October 16, 2006 I 
											heard in the news program “All 
											Things Considered” in the afternoon 
											in a National Public Radio affiliate 
											station in New Orleans that 
											America's population would reach 300 
											million mark by tomorrow morning.&nbsp; 
											Now, do not take these words for 
											sure.&nbsp; A demographer who was talking 
											to the newscaster said that this was 
											a theoretical projection.&nbsp; For that 
											matter, America's population may 
											have already reached 300 million by 
											now or it may reach that level 
											within months but experts who make a 
											living by forecasting how many 
											people live in this country have 
											said that by October 17, 2006 
											America's population would surpass 
											the magic number, i.e., 300 million.

											<font face="Verdana">When I first 
											came to America in 1969 to attend a 
											university for my graduate degree in 
											1969 America's population had 
											reached 200 million only two years 
											ago in 1967.&nbsp; Therefore, it took 
											about 39 years to add 100 million 
											people to America's population.&nbsp; 
											With the addition of 100 million 
											people the demography is also 
											changing very rapidly.&nbsp; The number 
											of white (Caucasian of European 
											descent) used to be the majority in 
											1967 and it still is but now the 
											Hispanic (Spanish speaking people 
											from Mexico, Central America, and 
											South America) population is on the 
											rise.&nbsp; They are the runners-up and 
											at the rate their number is growing, 
											they may surpass the white 
											population within the next 100 
											years.&nbsp; The population expert in 
											America after examining the new 
											figure say that the white population 
											will become minority in the distant 
											future as compared to other 
											ethnicities.&nbsp; Thus, one may 
											humorously say that the “browning of 
											America” has started in earnest.&nbsp;</font></span></div>

											<span style="font-size: 10pt">
											<font face="Verdana">I learned many 
											a statistic on America's population 
											growth from the NPR report.&nbsp; Do you 
											know that one child is born every 15 
											seconds while one person dies every 
											30 seconds?&nbsp; This translates as 
											follows: every 30 seconds America 
											add one person to their population.&nbsp; 
											Therefore, about 2,880 people are 
											added to the number per day.&nbsp; This 
											also means about 1million and fifty 
											one thousand people are to the 
											population every year.&nbsp; The real 
											number must be higher than this 
											because every year America allows 
											new immigrants to come to this 
											country and on top of it no one 
											really knows for sure how many 
											illegal aliens are crossing the 
											border mainly from the south of the 
											border.&nbsp; One estimate that we hear 
											often is that about 20 million 
											illegal aliens are there in the 
											U.S.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></span></div>

											in the year 1915 America's 
											population reached the 100 million 
											mark.&nbsp; It took 52 years for the 
											population to become double in 1967. 
											Now it took about 39 years to add 
											another 100 million.&nbsp; The population 
											growth rate is not even among 
											various ethnic groups in America.&nbsp; 
											For example the population growth 
											rate is lowest among white Caucasian 
											but compare this with the Hispanic 
											population whose number is just 
											exploding.&nbsp; The Hispanics in America 
											are new immigrants and many of them 
											are illegal too.&nbsp; They are Roman 
											Catholic by faith who mostly listen 
											to the dictum of Catholic Church 
											that does not favor any kind of 
											birth control measure. &nbsp;</font></span></div>

											America is also called the nation of 
											immigrants or melting pot.&nbsp; The 
											first wave of immigrants came from 
											England to the shore of Plymouth 
											Rock in 1620.&nbsp; Later, immigrants 
											came by shipload from northern 
											Europe.&nbsp; Slaves from western Africa 
											were also brought on to speed up 
											farming tobacco, cotton, and other 
											cash crop.&nbsp; In early 1900 immigrants 
											came from southern and eastern 
											Europe.&nbsp; Many Chinese immigrants 
											came to the west coast many of them 
											were brought here to construct the 
											trans-American railway.&nbsp; It was in 
											the late 1950s that America saw the 
											first wave of Asian immigrants 
											mostly from the Philippines and 
											Korea.&nbsp; Immigrants from South Asia, 
											Iran, and Arab nations started 
											poring into America in the early 
											1970s.&nbsp; When I first came to America 
											I did not see many immigrants from 
											Bangladesh; however, that would 
											change soon.&nbsp; Bangalees were coming 
											by droves beginning from mid 1980s.&nbsp; 
											Immigrants from South Asia hardly 
											constitute low single digit number 
											in terms of percentage.&nbsp; But their 
											number is growing by leaps and 
											bounds.</span></font><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></span></div>

											<font face="Verdana">It is very 
											interesting to probe into America’s 
											population growth starting from 
											1620.&nbsp; In about 400 years the 
											population rose from few hundred to 
											about 300 million.&nbsp; Of course tens 
											and thousands of Native Americans 
											(Red Indians) used to crisscross 
											America but they were decimated by 
											the invading Europeans.&nbsp; 
											Unfortunately, their number has 
											dwindled and many now live in 
											reservations mostly in the western 
											states or they live in remote 
											places.&nbsp; As of late, a section of 
											American Indians has gotten wealth 
											because of some quirky law by virtue 
											of which they could operate 
											lucrative gambling operation.&nbsp; 
											However, that is a different story 
											to be dealt in its entirety in

											<font face="Verdana">In summary, the 
											talking heads of radio industry are 
											hyping about the fact that America’s 
											population may have reached 300 
											million mark.&nbsp; The population growth 
											rate of this country is put at 1%.&nbsp; 
											Contrast this low number with that 
											from Pakistan where the rate is 
											anywhere from 1.75 to 2%.&nbsp; 
											Bangladesh is doing a tad better.&nbsp; 
											Thanks to NGOs working in the area 
											of family planning.&nbsp; Ideally one 
											would like to see the entire world 
											subscribe to the idea of “Zero 
											Population Growth,” which could 
											stabilize the population of our 
											globe, which is about 6.25 to 6.5 
											billion.&nbsp; Chairman Mao Tse-tung of

											<font face="Verdana">For America, 
											however, it is a different story.&nbsp; 
											As long as the soil could produce 
											enough cereals, legumes, cotton, 
											etc., the population would surely 
											grow.&nbsp; America as a nation does not 
											have to worry about feeding its 
											teeming millions.&nbsp; I, however, 
											greatly worry about the unchecked 
											population growth of the least 
											developing nations of Africa, Asia 
											and Latin America because that is 
											where the population growth is out 
											of control.&nbsp; America on the other 
											hand with her abundant tillable land 
											should not have to worry to feed her 
											population for another hundred 
											years.&nbsp; That is why no demographer 
											worth his salt here talks seriously 
											about “zero population growth.”&nbsp; To 
											achieve that, a child should be born 
											every 30 seconds because as per the 
											mortality statistics, a person dies 
											here every 30 seconds.&nbsp; But with 
											agricultural land aplenty, why 
											should America follow Uncle Mao’s 
											coercive policy? </font></span>
