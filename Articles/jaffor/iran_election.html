	<i>&quot;Iranians have chosen their next president.&nbsp; An obscure ex-military man 
	who was appointed as mayor of Teheran only years ago made history backed by 
	Iran’s powerful clergies.&quot;<br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="verdana"> </font></strong><font face="verdana">With a 
	blazing speed, the Iranian authorities did the vote counting and declared 
	the hardliner candidate, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was backed by the ruling 
	clergies and Revolutionary Guard, the winner in the June 24 presidential 
	election.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The election result came as a shock to many Iranians, never mind the rest 
	of the world.&nbsp; The western press thought that Ahmadinejad’s opponent, Akabar 
	Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was a two-term president in the nineties, would win 
	the election because of his stature and his present-day worldview.&nbsp; But 
	alas, the born-again reformist candidate who was repackaged by liberals in 
	Iran could not cut the muster at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last count Ahamadinejad, the mayor of Teheran, garnered 61.5% of 
	the popular vote; on the other hand, Hashemi Rafsanjani only received 
	38.5%.&nbsp; This would be viewed as a landslide victory by the candidate 
	supported by both Iranian clerics and military.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is very clear that the alliance between ruling clerics and Iranian 
	army has produced a formidable force.&nbsp; As long as this alliance lives, no 
	reformist candidate could win in any future elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Iranian history will view Khatami’s two-term presidency as a mere 
	aberration.&nbsp; Reformist movement is going to be dead and obsolete in this 
	ancient land.&nbsp; Friday’s win by a hardliner politician in Iran spoke in 
	volume the ground reality – reformist movement is a thing of the past.&nbsp; Iran 
	has already become mullahdom and make no mistake about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The outgoing president Mohammad Khatami tried in vain to institute reform 
	in Iranian society.&nbsp; The clerics hated it so much that on February 20, 2004, 
	in the parliamentary election, they booted out liberal parliamentarian 
	members and replaced them with hardliner politicians.&nbsp; This time around, 
	they chose a relatively young and novice politician as their favorite 
	candidate, they rallied behind him, and the rest is history.&nbsp; The clerics 
	have taken back the presidency from reformists.&nbsp; Quite a victory indeed!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; A week before the runoff election Hashemi Rafsanjani garnered slightly 
	more than 21% of the vote in the first election.&nbsp; Mayor Ahmadinejad came out 
	second neck-to-neck.&nbsp; The three other hardliners received each 16-18% of the 
	votes.&nbsp; If most of the votes received by hardliner candidates went for Mayor 
	Ahmadinejad, then it makes a whole lot of sense as to why he came out 
	victorious.&nbsp; The only reformist candidate, Mostafa Moin, received 14% of the 
	votes and if those votes went for Rafsanjani on June 24 election, then 
	Rafsanjani would receive 35% of the votes.&nbsp; The fact that he received 38.5% 
	votes tells us that many reformists and liberals had abstained from 
	voting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Iranian civil rights leader Ms. Shirin Ebadi gave a clarion call to her 
	followers to boycott the election because of the interference by the 
	12-member Guardian Council.&nbsp; Maybe her call for abstinence from the 
	electoral process has resulted in less participation from the liberal 
	voters.&nbsp; Right after the June 24 election Rafsanjani’s political aid Mr. 
	Mani Alizadeh predicted that his candidate would lose the election by a wide 
	margin because only 23 million of Iran’s 47 million eligible voters have 
	participated in this election.&nbsp; This would mean that only 49% of the voters 
	have cast their votes in the runoff election.&nbsp; A week ago on June 17, 2005, 
	about 63% of the voters turned up for voting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Why then 13% of the voters who participated in the earlier election 
	hardly 7 days ago had decided not to participate?&nbsp; The answer lies in the 
	fact that many liberals did not believe that they had a real choice in this 
	election.&nbsp; Since these voters did not show up in the runoff election, the 
	second most vote getters, Mayor Ahmadinejad, had won the election.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; A shrewd politician, Ahmadinejad, the 47-year-old mayor of the capital, 
	campaigned as a champion of the poor, a message that resonated with voters 
	in a country where some estimates put unemployment as high as 30 percent.&nbsp; 
	He portrayed himself as a simple working man against Rafsanjani, who is a 
	multimillionaire businessman belonging to Iran’s ruling elite.&nbsp; From 
	newspapers’ description of this novice politician, I learned that the mayor 
	of Teheran came from a humble background.&nbsp; His is a son of an illiterate 
	worker who joined Iranian’s Revolutionary Guard while he was in his twenties 
	and fought against Saddam’s army.&nbsp; His meteoric rise to power in Iran could 
	be the subject matter for a fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahmadinejad’s message to Iranian voters was simple.&nbsp; Being a 
	self-proclaimed fundamentalist he sought a return to the moral “purity” of 
	the early years of the Islamic revolution (1979-1988), has also insisted 
	freedom in Iran “is already beyond what could be imagined.”&nbsp; His campaign 
	took up the pocketbook issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Iran is facing a massive unemployment (about 30%).&nbsp; He promised to 
	improve the economy, create jobs, etc.&nbsp; In contrast to that, Rafsanjani 
	talked more about ideology and about the deterioration of relationship 
	between Iran and the West.&nbsp; The common voters hardly give a damn about 
	ideology and Iran-West feud.&nbsp; Therefore, it looks as if Ahmadinejad’s simple 
	message struck a chord amongst most ordinary Iranians.&nbsp; They came in droves 
	to vote for him on June 24 and that made him a winner while surprising the 
	most sophisticated Iranian political pundits.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The clerics in Iran are not fools.&nbsp; To whip up anti-American feeling 
	amongst voters who were coming to the polling place where Mayor Ahmadinejad 
	voted in Teheran they painted British, US and Israeli flags on the ground so 
	voters could step on them.&nbsp; When the mayor came to cast his vote he was 
	greeted by the chant of “Death to America!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1979 when Iran’s king, Reza Shah Pahlavi, was deposed by an alliance 
	of Mullahs and socialists, Imam Khomeini coined the term “America, the Great 
	Satan” and his followers would chant “Death to America” while taking America 
	hostages from the U.S. Embassy.&nbsp; Thus, mere mention of the slogan “Death to 
	America” brings a lot of emotion amongst Iranians.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; What is going to happen in Iran, now that a hardliner politician is 
	poised to take the control?&nbsp; One thing is for sure.&nbsp; Anti American feeling 
	amongst Iranians will be on the rise.&nbsp; Mind you, Ahmadinejad won the 
	election as he mentioned his dislike for America.&nbsp; The clerics will support 
	him to whip up anti American sentiments in Iran.&nbsp; Ahmadinejad will probably 
	favor the making of nukes.&nbsp; Not too long ago Iran’s clergy told the West 
	that Iran has every right to purify plutonium.&nbsp; The belligerency concerning 
	making of the nuke will surely rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The reform movement instituted by outgoing president Mohammad Khatami 
	will be put on a backburner as the nation makes a retrogressive journey, 
	which many liberal Iranians call – a move to the dark ages or yesteryears.&nbsp; 
	Furthermore, Iran’s clergies will restart a vilification campaign against 
	Israel.&nbsp; In domestic front, we will see Iran’s ruling clergies clamping on 
	free mixing between men and women.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The West is not going to sit idle when Ahmadinejad takes power from 
	Khatami.&nbsp; President Bush and his lieutenants such as Vice President Cheney, 
	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Secretary of Defense Donald 
	Rumsfeld will all vilify Iran by saying that the nation has made a u-turn 
	and heading towards extremism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The above-mentioned scenarios will most likely play out.&nbsp; Iranians have 
	made a choice and now they will pay a price.&nbsp; Less freedom and democracy is 
	what is expected under the leadership of president-elect Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Iranians have chosen their next president.&nbsp; An obscure 
	ex-military man who was appointed as mayor of Teheran only years ago made 
	history backed by Iran’s powerful clergies.&nbsp; The same clergies have 
	engineered the takeover of Iran’s parliament on February 20, 2004 when 
	Guardian Council barred over 2500 reformist candidates from taking part in 
	the election.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; This time around, the same clerics have engineered another coup.&nbsp; They 
	are about to replace the reformist president Khatami who wanted to bring 
	about change in Iran and make the nation move towards modernity.&nbsp; That 
	movement will stop and in its place the nation will tread a path leading to 
	nowhere but a sha’ria based Utopia.&nbsp; Iranians will have to fasten their 
	seatbelt because the ride to past could be bumpy.</font><b><i><font face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
