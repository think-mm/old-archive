        <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Considering the subject matter
        of Kali Dasa's 'Meghadoot,' I should have taken an interest in it a long
        time ago, but for whatever reasons I did not. Now I am immensely
        interested the masterpiece collection of poems by this legendary poet of
        North India. He penned his poems in Sanskrit, which was a living
        language then. Some may consider his poems from Meghadoot laced with
        eroticism. Nonetheless, these poems are very narrative (descriptive) and
        at the same time very expressive in the sense that the poems outpour
        human emotions. For example, many a poem reflects the feelings of a
        tormented soul - a young Jakkha, inhabitant of Aloka, a Himalayan town
        north of modern-day Almora in UP, India. According to legend, Aloka is
        located in High Himalaya next to Manos Saravar (Lake Manos), the place
        where from the Ganges originate.</font>
        <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">There are many legends
        surrounding Jakkhas of ancient India. The members of Jakkha clan are
        also known as Kuber. Among myriad legends about Jakkha, first there is
        this one -- they were extremely rich. Who has not heard of Jakkha's Dhon
        or Wealth? In Sanskrit, Kuber means Ku (Ugly or bad) + ber (body) or
        unsightly face. According to legend, Kubers are three-legged humans and
        they have only eight teeth, their right eye burned or hazel eyed. From
        Ramayana, we learn that they lived originally in Lanka-the modern day
        Sri Lanka. The original Kuber is the son of Bisraba and Debobarnini and
        his name was Boisraban. He was the treasurer of gods and goddesses. He
        was stepbrother to Ravana, the famous villain of Ramayana whole stole
        Rama?s wife, Sita. Because of war between Rama and Ravana, Kuber left
        the island and moved deep into the mainland. He settled down in a place
        in high Himalaya. His descendents lived in Aloka or Alokadham, the most
        beautiful and rich city in ancient India. Aloka's fabled women were
        renowned for their physical beauty and charm. The beauty of the gardens
        of that fabled town also drew attention of many poets.</font>
        <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">The narrator of Meghadoot is a
        young Kuber who is introduced as Jakkha. According to legend, the young
        Jakkha was appointed a guardsman in one of the many pretty parks in
        Aloka. He was recently married to a gorgeous young girl. He could not
        resist the temptation of visiting his lover in the daytime to be with
        her when he was supposed to guard the garden. He ignored his duty to be
        united physically with his newly married wife. In his absence, according
        to a legend, an elephant trampled some flowerbeds. The news was leaked
        out to Jakkha's supervisor. The elder then decided to send young Jakkha
        alone to Ramgiri Parvat (modern day Ramtek, north of Nagpur) located
        about 650 miles south of Aloka to live there for a year.</font><br>
        <br>
        <p><center><img src="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nirvana1/files/Megh/ravi.JPG" width="539" height="363"></center>
        <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Jakkha found a place to live in
        a hermitage in Ramgiri Parvat. There was lake next to the hermitage.
        According to legend, Sita also bathed in this lake making its water
        holy. At the advent of monsoon season, Jakkha saw towering cloud of
        cumulus 'castellatus' (castle-like rain producing clouds) coming from
        the south and moving northwardly towards Aloka where his beloved lives.
        An idea evolved in lovelorn Jakkha's mind seeing these magnificent
        cumulus rain clouds. He badly wanted to send his Sandeshas or
        Kusholbarta (news) to his beloved. Thus, Megh (cloud) becomes his
        messenger. He approaches the cloud with reverence. He greets him with
        affectionate words and then tells the cloud how to get to Aloka from
        Ramgiri. All these descriptions are there in Kali Dasa's semi-erotic
        poems. He also tells the cloud what to say when it will reach his
        beloved. The entire 117 poems describe in vivid detail the landscape,
        lore of the land, love ballad, longing, and other human qualities of a
        desolate life that Jakkha was leading. In the last line of Meghadootam,
        Jakkha warns the Cloud not to separate from lightning in the long
        journey that lies ahead because lovelorn Jakkha knows the pain of
        separation from one's beloved. Everyone needs a lover even the
        thunder-producing cumulus cloud has 'Lightning' as its consort just as
        Shiva has Parvati. Thus, we see that even Kali Dasa brings the Eastern
        concept of Yinyang - the two complementary forces or principles that
        encompasses all aspects or phenomena of life -- into Meghadootam.</font>
        <p><font size="+1" color="#006600" face="Comic Sans MS">The Cloud
        Messenger's whimsical flight path</font>
        <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">When the lovelorn Jakkha
        implored the Could Messenger to deliver his messages to his beloved in
        Aloka, he gave a detail flight path to the messenger. The Cloud could
        have gone straight north from Ramgiri Parvat (modern day Ramtek) to
        Aloka-dham (abode). Jakkha, however, gave the Cloud Messenger a very
        complicated flight path. Sometime going to the north, sometime veering
        to the east and sometime going northeast. He made sure that the Cloud
        would go over villages and town so that people living there could see
        him. He also knew that without monsoon rain there could be no
        agriculture. The entire 64 poems included in the Purba-Megh (Pre-Megh)
        part of the poem collection describe in vivid detail the itinerant
        journey of Cloud Messenger from Ramgiri to Aloka in high Himalaya. Some
        of the advice to Cloud Messenger is utterly funny. In one place, Jakkha
        tells the cloud to scare the villagers by pelting hails. There are ample
        descriptions of Amrakoot Mountain in poem number seventeen, eighteen,
        and nineteen (Purba-megh); similarly, in poem number twenty five the
        ancient poet describes the nation of Bidisha and its capital Dosharno;
        there is even the mention of turbulent Bethrabati River. In poem number
        twenty-eight and twenty-nine (Purbo-megh), we notice the mention of
        ancient cities such as Ujjayini, Shoudhapur, and Nirvindya River. In
        poems thirty-one through thirty-three (Purbo-megh), Kali Dasa describes
        meticulously not only the art of applying makeup by the pretty maidens
        of fabled town Avanti, but also how they both perfumized and color their
        long and wavy hair. There is also the mention of one Shipra River whose
        cool waters refreshed all the pretty maidens who spent the night
        enveloped by their lovers' arm. The Cloud Messenger should not forget to
        visit Devagiri on his way to Aloka to pay homage to Shiva and Parvati.
        Then he will cross the town of Dashapura on the Bank of Sindhu River.
        After that, he will cross the Mahabharata-famed battleground Kurukhetra
        to reach the ancient land of Kon-Khol. The Cloud Messenger will surely
        cross the land where sacred waters of Jahannobi-Jamuna met. His flight
        path will then take him to mountainous land where one encounters
        evergreen deodar forest (devadaru in Sanskrit) before he reaches many
        kingdoms in High Himalaya. There, he will first encounter the Kroncho
        Mountain before reaching Mount Kailas and then Manos Lake. The Cloud
        Messenger should quench his thirst by drinking the holy water of Manos
        Sarabar (lake) before resuming his journey on the way to Aloka, his
        final destination.</font><br>

        the above description of Cloud Messenger's journey one could imagine
        that it was not a straightforward trip from south to north. In his
        meandering journey, the Cloud Messenger covered many a fabled towns. In
        the map provided here I dotted the line to show the flight path of the
        entire trip. The names of many ancient towns are placed on the map for
        easy identification. These towns are essentially located in modern-day
        Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Kali Dasa composed about 64 poems to
        describe the itinerant journey of the Cloud Messenger. The rest -- about
        54 poems -- were devoted to Sandesha (messages) for Jakkha's beloved
        wife. Those poems describe in vivid detail the description of Aloka, the
        Himalayan town famed its for natural beauty, riches, pretty women, and
        buildings. These poems also describe in detail the beauty of unification
        between lovers. Jakkha serves one purpose via sending his Sandeshas or
        Bartas (messages) to his beloved to bide at home, until he returns from
        Ramgiri Parvat.</font>
