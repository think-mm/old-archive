	<i><b><font class="caption">A dead Kibria is being taken to Birdem at 
	11.30am.. (Photo courtesy: Daily Star)</font></b></i></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A carnage has taken place in 
	Habiganj on January 26, 2005, in which five people had died including 
	Bangladesh’s former finance minister, Shah AMS Kibria, who happened to be a 
	parliamentarian at the time of his death. According to eyewitness report, 
	grenade was lobbed at Mr. Kibria as he was stepping down from the dais after 
	finishing his address before an enthusiastic crowd who have attended an 
	outdoor political rally. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The news of this carnage were 
	carried by all major wire services including AP, Reuters, CNN, AFP, BBC, 
	etc. One could go to Yahoo news site and read all about it. The “pristine” 
	image of Bangladesh was marred by the news of this gruesome killing in 
	Habiganj while the PM, Khaleda Zia, pontificates her party men in Muktarpur 
	(Munshiganj) on the same day telling that her government had removed 
	terrorism from the land. What a chutzpah she has! I read the account of her 
	address in Bangladesh Observer on January 28, 2005. The newspaper wrote: 
	“The Prime Minister said her government had removed terrorism as per the 
	commitment made to the people before the general election. “Legal action 
	will be taken against those engaged in terrorism. None will be allowed to 
	resort to terrorism,” she cautioned amid applause from the audience.””
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What does it say about Khaleda Zia’s 
	acumen? The day she made this preposterous announcement, five of her 
	countrymen had sustained brutal attack in Habiganj. I suppose in her eyes 
	the lawbreakers who lobbed the grenade are not terrorists and the vile act 
	cannot be labeled as terrorism. Such is her “insightful” observation. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This act of terrorism comes on the 
	hill of a very damaging write-up on January 23, 2005, in the magazine 
	section of New York Times, a widely respected newspaper. Ms. Eliza Griswold, 
	the reporter, painted a very grim picture of Bangladesh in which 
	Taliban-style militia may began their reigns of terror. Yesterday’s brutal 
	killing in Habiganj is no doubt a prelude to what is to come in Bangladesh, 
	which once was an idyllic place to live not too long ago. In three decades 
	time, Bangladesh was transformed from a docile to a violent place. Thanks to 
	the action of two military despots who veered the nation from a secular 
	democracy to a hodge-podge of theo-democracy that created enough confusion 
	to give birth to self-styled Islamic vigilante force of <i>Bangla Bhai</i> 
	(read: Bangladeshi Mullah Omar). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The culture of blasting homemade 
	bomb, lobbing military-grade grenades, etc., is on the rise since 1999 when 
	powerful bombs were detonated in a musical soiree in Town Hall ground in 
	Jessore in which Udichi, the cultural wing of Bangladesh Communist party, 
	was hosting the program. Ten people were killed and over 200 injured in that 
	blast. The spate of bombing and grenade attack continued until this day.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The nation had received a wake-up 
	call on August 21, 2004, when dozens of grenades were tossed into throngs of 
	meeting attendees in central city Dhaka while the secular political party, 
	Awami League, organized an outdoor meeting. Hundreds of policemen stood 
	there like silent spectators as the terrorists lobbed grenades from nearby 
	buildings. Luckily, Mrs. Hasina Wazed, the leader of Awami League survived 
	the attack but many of her party men and women including one female leader 
	died in the bloody carnage. The assassins doggedly pursued to kill Hasina 
	Wazed as they pumped bullets into her car. Again, the police standing nearby 
	stood silently and could not catch one of the assailants. Barely six weeks 
	after the carnage, a commission consisting of a lone Judge gave the report 
	on October 2, 2004. His conclusion did not make any sense. According to the 
	Judge, the intelligence department of a neighboring nation had perpetrated 
	the attack on Hasina Wazed and her party workers in collaboration with the 
	local hoodlums to create enough anarchy to topple the government. The full 
	report of the commission was hermetically sealed in an envelope never to see 
	light of the day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since that dreadful attack on August 
	21, 2004, which is widely known as 8/21 tragedy, more attacks were launched 
	but the government of Khaleda Zia focused its attention to nab 
	garden-variety miscreants with the help of a new police force, RAB. Her 
	government had proved to be very inept vis-à-vis the terrorism engendered by 
	grenade lobbers who have targeted secular political force as their mortal 
	enemy. It should be mentioned here that not once did the terrorists target 
	Mrs. Zia’s political rally nor did it target Jamaat or IOJ (Islamic United 
	Party)’s rally. What does it tell you? It is widely believed by Bangladesh’s 
	intelligentsia that Islamic fundamentalism is at play here. The nation is 
	treading the slippery slope jihadism and fundamentalism and the government 
	party is in cahoots with the fringe parties. That is precisely why the 
	ruling BNP has not sustained one single bomb or grenade attack thus far. It 
	is also worth mentioning here that when the newly appointed British High 
	Commissioner, Mr. Anwar Chowdhury, visited his boyhood town of Sylhet on May 
	21, 2004 he became an easy target for assassination. The terrorists lobbed a 
	grenade at him; miraculously he came out unscathed. The reason he was 
	attacked is as follows: The government of Tony Blair had supported George 
	Bush to wage a war against Iraq. Since Mr. Chowdhury represented the British 
	Government, he became an easy target for assassination. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The latest carnage at Habiganj in 
	which Shah ASM Kibria died from grenade attack along with 4 more 
	meeting-goers has shaken the faith of all decent people in Bangladesh who 
	believe in democracy, fair play, right to dissent, etc. The government only 
	provides lip service to citizens when tragedy strikes Bangladesh’s civil 
	society. The police and intelligence department had miserably failed to 
	catch one terrorist let alone identify who are behind all these attacks.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How long this bloodletting will 
	continue? Who will be the next target amongst secularist politicians? These 
	are the provocative questions in my mind. Ms. Eliza Griswold of New York 
	Times was right on the money when she boldly proclaimed that Bangladesh is 
	becoming a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism (read: terrorism). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sadly, bomb blasting and grenade 
	lobbing have become an everyday event in Bangladesh as more fatwas emanate 
	from the foaming mouth of Mufti Amini and the likes of him. Soon the entire 
	nation will be radicalized. The telltale signs are already there. No doubt 
	that a stealth group is working round the clock to push the nation of 145 
	million impoverished folks into utter chaos with the hope that the nation 
	will be under the grip of a violent parochial group. And in my view, 
	something should be done right away to stop this retrogressive journey. It 
	is hard to imagine that the nation that had sacrificed three million people 
	thirty-four years ago to achieve independence will watch silently this 
	morbid transformation. As I pen this essay, the nation is at peril. All that 
	was achieved in the last three decades will vanish into thin air unless this 
	cancer of grenade lobbing and bomb blasting is checked. A mega-surgery is 
	what the doctor will be asking for. </font></p>
