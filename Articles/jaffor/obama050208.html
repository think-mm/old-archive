  <div class="doc-layout-body">
	&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have always supported the 
	Democratic Ticket in all presidential elections held in America. When I 
	first came to America in 1969, ‘Tricky Dick’ (Richard M. Nixon) was the 
	president who took office in late January 1969. Nixon, a Republican 
	politician who served as the vice president for President Dwight D. 
	Eisenhower for 8 years, was at the helm. He promised during the campaign all 
	throughout 1968 that he would pull out troops from Vietnam once he becomes 
	the president. This is the promise that he reneged. His evil counsel, Henry 
	Kissinger, engineered the proliferation of Vietnam War to neighboring 
	countries such as Laos and Cambodia. In 1972, the Democrats put forth the 
	candidacy of Senator George McGovern, a liberal candidate, who promised to 
	end the war in Vietnam. However, he was soundly defeated by Richard Nixon. 
	But Nixon paid very dearly for bugging the Watergate Complex office of 
	McGovern’s election headquarters. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I never liked even one Republican 
	candidate who ran for the White House. The first time I was allowed to vote 
	in presidential election, it was 1984 when Ronald Reagan was reelected; this 
	time the Democrat had nominated Vice President Walter Mondale, a descent 
	man. But Reagan was immensely popular then for whatever reasons not quite 
	understood by me. Reagan’s 8 years in office resulted in huge budget 
	deficit. He promised to make the federal government a small one but ended up 
	making it a big one.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">America had the choice to elect 
	another descent human being, Governor Michael Dukakis, in 1988 but the 
	nation elected George H.W. Bush instead. Dukakis was a victim of vile 
	campaign attack. George W. Bush knew how to scare people and he did that 
	with negative campaign. Bush’s 4 years in office was uneventful and was 
	plagued with savings and loan scandal. In 1992 Americans elected Bill 
	Clinton. Thanks to the Third party candidate, Russ Perot, who stole enough 
	votes from Bush to help Bill Clinton win the election. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2000, George W. Bush received the 
	nomination from Republican Party and ran against Vice President Al Gore. 
	Even though Gore received more popular votes, he lost the election to Bush. 
	Thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court that did not allow the recounting of votes 
	in Florida. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">George W. Bush’s presidency is mired 
	in Iraq War, a misadventure totally based on false intelligence gathering. 
	The Islamic terrorists did a favor to Mr. Bush in 2001 when they hijacked 
	four passenger airlines and rammed two of them against the World Trade 
	Center killing nearly 3000 innocent civilians. Mr. Bush took the opportunity 
	to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. The rest is history. Bush who 
	inherited a healthy economy with budget surplus transformed the nation’s 
	economy into a sick one. With gas price escalating and economy shrinking, 
	the nation plunged into a recession in late 2007. As of this writing, the 
	Federal Reserve cut down the interest rate three times to revive the anemic 
	economy. No one is certain how severe the recession would be and when the 
	economy would turn around. Under this dire backdrop the two parties, 
	Democratic and Republican, are selecting their candidate. I will not address 
	the Republican race in this article. Let me stay focus with the Democratic 
	Party’s choice for the candidate who very probably will run in November 
	against Senator John McCain who looks like would become the torchbearer of 
	the Grand Ol’ Party. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama is a freshman 
	legislator from Illinois who gave a fiery speech in the summer of 2004 at 
	the Democratic Convention when Senator John Kerry became the party’s 
	candidate to run against George W. Bush. Barack Obama was elected as the 
	senator from Illinois in the same year. Later he was sworn in 2005. He 
	quickly established himself to be an effective legislator while learning the 
	inner workings of Washington. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Barack Obama decided to run for the 
	office of U.S. President two years after he became the senator. However, the 
	field was very crowded as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, senator from New 
	York and ex-First lady, Senator John Edwards, Governor Bill Richardson, and 
	Congressman Dennis Kucinich all vying for the grand prize, i.e. to receive 
	the party’s nomination. Once the primaries get going the field was narrowed 
	down to two candidates. Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama 
	were competing against each other for the party’s nomination. Both the 
	candidates have received millions of dollars as donations. On Super Tuesday, 
	February 5, 2008, democrats living in 20 states will vote in the primaries 
	and the polling results will give us an idea who might get the party’s 
	nomination in the summer of 2008 when the delegates will convene to choose 
	their candidate.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Earlier polls have indicated that 
	Senator Hillary Clinton was leading Obama by single digit percentage points 
	but a day before the Super Tuesday the race was tightening. Indications are 
	that Obama may win in few populous states and so will Senator Hillary 
	Clinton.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama received the head 
	start when he won the contest in Iowa but he came up second in New Hampshire 
	next to Senator Clinton. But in South Carolina Senator Clinton was soundly 
	defeated in late January 2008. President Bill Clinton and his daughter 
	Chelsea campaigned extensively in South Carolina, which has many African 
	American electorates. Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton injected racism 
	into the campaign and for that he was reprimanded by many senior Democrats, 
	and civil rights leaders. On Martin Luther King holiday the Clintons made 
	some controversial comments telling the Americans that it was President 
	Johnson who was instrumental in enacting the civil rights laws. The 
	contributions of the slain civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, in 
	mobilizing the public opinion for changing the laws were underplayed by the 
	Clintons. This unfortunate development greatly displeased many liberal 
	Americans. Suddenly, we witnessed that racism was brought into the primaries 
	by Clinton camp. In my humble opinion this unfortunate development coupled 
	with president Bill Clinton’s unbridled remarks in South Carolina have cost 
	Senator Clinton some votes. Soon she realized that a mistake was made.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On January 31, 2008 both Obama and 
	Clinton participated in a very civil debate where they complimented each 
	other and refrained from making barbed comments against one another. 
	However, Senator Obama boldly made the assertion that while Senator Clinton 
	went along with Bush’s decision to invade Iraq, he opposed the decision. 
	Clearly, Obama wanted to establish himself as the anti-war candidate.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama’s campaign speech had 
	energized many Americans especially the young college kids when he portrayed 
	him as the agent of change that America needs so desperately. Many people 
	saw the reflection in him of President John F. Kennedy while others saw 
	reflection of Dr. Martin Luther King. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama is a gifted orator, 
	undoubtedly. His message is getting through to the electorates. Many people 
	consequently opened their purse. One thing Obama campaign does not lack is 
	money. It is the testament that many Americans liked his views on myriad 
	topics such as healthcare reform, doing away with the evil influence of 
	corporations in politics, a drastic change in foreign policy including 
	bringing back troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Americans who aspire to see a change 
	in their nation is supporting Senator Obama. They say that Senator Clinton 
	represents old politics, which include the influence of special interest. It 
	will be interesting to see if Obama’s candidacy catches fire. One thing is 
	for sure. President Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, her cousin, Maria 
	Shriver, and the slain president’s youngest brother, Senator Edward Kennedy 
	all had thrown their weights behind Senator Obama. This is unprecedented and 
	the like of which have never seen before. This has made the Clintons very 
	unhappy. But life goes on as usual. Soon we will know whether Obama will 
	become that dream candidate who will have the support of the majority 
	electorates. Therefore, stay tuned.</font></div>
