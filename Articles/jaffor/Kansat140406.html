	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Someone once said, “Hell hath no 
	fury like a government scorned.” This is so true for the repressive 
	government of Khaleda Zia. While her police force is killing demonstrators 
	in Kansat, a sleepy little village marketplace about 250 kilometers 
	northwest of Dhaka, she has the audacity to go abroad or worse to connive a 
	wily western reporter to portray her like a queen while telling the world 
	that everything is hunky-dory in Golden Bengal under her stewardship. This 
	is far from being true. The PM may have to pay a very costly price for her 
	lassitude in the upcoming election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unless you’ve been away to a 
	wonderland in the second week of April 2006, you may have missed some 
	terrible news coming from Chapai Nawabganj area of Bangladesh. There, in the 
	villages near Kansat the rural folks had been protesting to establish their 
	rights to receive electricity. As the citizens of a democracy they have 
	every right to protest against the electricity department to receive their 
	fair share of electricity. However, their peaceful protestation in January 
	2006 was met with gunfire from police. Since then, violence had escalated in 
	villages near Kansat as more protest demonstrations were organized by the 
	aggrieved villagers who have formed a body calling it ‘Palli Bidyut Unnayan 
	Sangram Committee’ (PBUSC) or ‘Action Committee for Rural Power Development’ 
	to press their demand for more electricity. People who are familiar with the 
	comings and goings of Bangladesh know it darn well that urban areas receive 
	a favorable treatment over rural areas when it comes to distribution of 
	electricity. The villagers from Kansat area have legitimate claim over 
	electricity for which they pay a flat fee every month. They say that they 
	have to pay the full amount every month even though they get electricity for 
	hardly 1-2 hour each day. On top of it, they have to pay Taka 10 each month 
	for renting the meter. Some in the village say that this sum of money goes 
	to questionable fund since there is no provision for meter rental fees. All 
	these have made the villagers’ life miserable; consequently, they protested 
	against the electric supply department. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The government of Khaleda Zia did 
	not send any MPs from the area to Chapai Nawabganj to hear the villagers’ 
	grievance. Instead, the protestors were dealt heavy-handedly. Here is the 
	timeline of Kansat people becoming vocal about their plights and how they 
	were mistreated by the government. First, On January 4, 2006, this was 
	followed by killing of seven more villagers 16days later on January 23, 
	2006. Then two months went by without any violence. The month of April 
	became a bloody one. Four villagers were killed on April 6, 2006 and another 
	injured died later on April 12, 2006. Then, all hell broke loose a day later 
	(April 13) when six protesters were killed. In short three months 20 
	innocent people were gunned down by police. These villagers have legitimate 
	right to receive electricity for which they were paying a full price. The 
	question before us is why the police showed no restraint fully knowing that 
	the protesting villagers were not carrying any firearms. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Realizing what did happen in Kansat 
	on April 13, 2006 many people were comparing the police brutality executed 
	in Kansat with that of the killing of students at DU campus on February 21, 
	1952 by equally brutal police under the direction of Muslim League 
	government of Nurul Amin. Two years later in 1954 Muslim League was booted 
	out of office through adult franchise. The same may happen in 2007 when 
	Bangladeshi voters will elect their MPs for the nation’s parliament. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The tenacity showed by the heroic 
	people of Kansat may inspire others all over Bangladesh to protest against 
	the escalating food prices that had been going on for the last few months. 
	The newspapers in Bangladesh including the vernacular ones are reporting 
	that there is a nationwide solidarity for protesting Kansat villagers. The 
	government was too busy to prop up the image of the nation to outside world, 
	which was costing millions of dollar. The Kansat rebellion escaped totally 
	the radar screen of the four-party coalition government. The fall out from 
	Kansat carnage is too great and the government won’t be able to do a damage 
	control at this time no matter how hard they try. The Home Minister said a 
	day after the latest carnage that the grievance of the villagers will be 
	heard and settled peacefully; however, in my judgment it is too late. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By browsing any newspapers published 
	in the nation one would find a plethora of reports of public dissatisfaction 
	over escalating food prices. The middle class in the urban areas and poor 
	people from allover the nation are fretting over the price of essential 
	items. These people may take cue from the villagers of Kansat and take to 
	the street and if this happens, the government of Khaleda Zia will be in big 
	trouble. What the 14 united opposition parties could not do with all their 
	activists seems to be achieved by few thousand angry villagers from Kansat 
	area. Of course, there was a price tag for this – 20 dead people. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was widely reported in the 
	newspaper that Chapai Nawabganj area where Kansat Bazar is located is a 
	heavily BNP-dominated area. It is only natural that after what happened in 
	Kansat in the last three months the support of the villagers for BNP will 
	wane fast. The opposition party has already started to establish a dialogue 
	with affected villagers. This may have serious consequences for the ruling 
	party. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many observers think that Mrs. 
	Khaleda Zia is too preoccupied these days with the thought of upcoming 
	election; therefore, to prop up the sagging image of her party she has gone 
	to western reporter to build a pristine image of her leadership. Her 
	preoccupation with this thought may have isolated her from the ground 
	reality in her own country. The inflationary trend in food prices are not 
	abating anywhere in Bangladesh. If the trend continues, then she could kiss 
	good bye to her dream of being reelected the second time, consecutively. 
	Never mind the internal dissension in the party that had been brewing in the 
	last few months. The PM let the young faction take control of the party, 
	which made the old generation upset. It remains to be seen if the 
	disgruntled old-timers split from the main party to form their own party or 
	shake hands with Dr. Badruddoza’s Bikalpadhara. I am bringing all this up 
	for a good reason. Since there are many crosscurrents running in the 
	Bangladesh polity at this time, the bloody incidence of police brutality 
	against protesting villagers at Kansat may not have come at the right if one 
	looks from the PM’s perspective. She may have to do a damage control right 
	away. The fall out from Kansat carnage will continue. Therefore, stay tuned 
	for more development. It is a vultures’ world out there. The opposition may 
	capitalize the tragedy to strengthen their position for the upcoming 
	election. Is Khaleda Zia on the way out? Only time can tell.</font></p>
