	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh is again in the news for 
	all the wrong reasons. As the beleaguered nation of nearly 150 million 
	prepares itself to go for a nationwide election to elect parliamentary 
	members in early 2007, many crosscurrents are running allover of which some 
	does not bode well for the republic. There is a raging controversy over the 
	conduct of the Chief Election Commissioner. The voter list prepared by the 
	commissioner did not get the seal of approval from many political parties. 
	Even the present law minister of Bangladesh, Barrister Moudud, complained 
	about the veracity of the list. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The tiny nation had already 
	witnessed three popular revolts, two in the countryside namely in Kansat and 
	Shanir Akhra, and the other one in greater Dhaka where workers in the 
	country’s burgeoning garment industry had destroyed a few factories and 
	buildings to press their demands for equitable wages and other workplace 
	related issues. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above sporadic incidences have 
	given a black-eye to the present regime of Khaleda Zia who is all but 
	nonchalant about common men’s problem. She goes abroad to impress the 
	impoverished masses of Bangladesh while not addressing the pressing 
	pocket-book issues. The price of quotidian commodities is outpacing the wage 
	growth of ordinary people. Thanks to countrywide inflation of staples. When 
	she and her finance minister were asked how ordinary citizens could copout 
	with the onslaught of inflation, their glib answer had caused laughter and 
	made the headlines not for erudition but for their blithe disregard to 
	ordinary people’s anxiety – how are they going to pay for rice, lentil, 
	vegetables, etc.? The Pm and her minion had opined that the nation’s per 
	capita income has gone up; therefore, the inflation in commodity prices is 
	justifiable. Their view: People could afford to pay the higher prices. This 
	kind of logic reminded this scribe the tale of Queen Marie Antoinette, the 
	wife of Louis the Sixteenth, who advised the hungry French subjects to eat 
	cake if they can’t find any bread. Mrs. Khaleda Zia’s inanities know no 
	bounds. If you happen to believe her words, Bangladesh’s people are making 
	gobs of money - now that the nation’s GDP growth rate is going through the 
	roof and thus they will be able to pay for the foodstuffs at higher prices. 
	What a balderdash! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The BNP regime is very fussy about 
	Bangladesh’s image to outside world. The news of Kansat revolt, Shanir Akhra 
	revolt, and garments’ worker unrest in Greater Dhaka, are painting a very 
	dismal picture of Bangladesh. Outsiders think that the government is either 
	not in control or trying to create a state of anarchy so that normal 
	election process cannot go through. The ruling party is fearful of the 
	notion that if the election were held today, they will lose it a big time. I 
	do not think that Mrs. Zia regime is that much concern at this time about 
	preserving the “pristine” image of Bangladesh to outside world. Therefore, 
	the news of the arrest of Bangladeshi drug baron, Badruddoza Chowdhury 
	Momen, in England is making any wave among Mrs. Zia and her inner circle.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We learned on May 28, 2006 that the 
	chairman of one of Bangladesh’s most respected companies has been arrested 
	on suspicion of trafficking a large amount of heroin into Britain. The 
	arrest came after one of report published first in England, which revealed 
	how consignments of food, floor tiles and beauty products, dispatched by a 
	network of companies in Bangladesh ended up England filled with narcotics.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The news story caught everyone by 
	surprise because Bangladesh was never considered to be one of those nations 
	involved in narco trades. The drug dealers used Bangladeshi business house 
	to ship heroine to England and thereby put the nation into world map turning 
	an otherwise docile nation into a new conduit for narco trafficking into 
	Britain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The British police had arrested 
	Badruddoza Chowdhury Momen, chairman of BD Foods Ltd, which is in the 
	business of supplying spices and other food products to Britain's curry 
	houses. He is now in prison on remand waiting for questioning. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Momen’s arrest came in the wake 
	of disclosure by a former senior employee within BD Foods, Nazmul Haider 
	Bulbul, in court documents as the mastermind behind the long-running drug 
	smuggling operation. According to the documents, six senior government 
	officials of Bangladesh are also alleged to have taken part in the scheme.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The British authorities allege that 
	Mr. Momen was also involved in heroine trafficking to other EU nations from 
	England. The Bangladeshi tycoon’s arrest has shocked the Bangladeshi 
	business community in Britain where the drug baron was awarded the title of 
	‘Commercially Important Person’ by the Bangladesh government for his 
	outstanding performance in export business' for three years running. His 
	company employed 3,000 staff around the world. The revelation that Mr. Momen 
	was heavily involved in narco trafficking now puts the present government of 
	Bangladesh headed by Khaleda Zia into shame. Whatever happened to her 
	propaganda that Bangladesh’s image as a pristine nation should be preserved 
	at all cost. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The drug baron had indeed become a 
	major trafficker of heroine into Britain. Sources close to the investigation 
	said Momen was being questioned about allegations that he smuggled about 
	948kg of heroin to the UK over the past 15 years and that he ran a lucrative 
	drug distribution business out of the UK to other European nations. Mr. 
	Momen had globalized his business operation. He allegedly bought heroin 
	mainly from Pakistan, where he maintained an office </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In April 2006 The Observer (England) 
	reported that a network of ghost companies linked to BD Foods was solely 
	responsible for bringing heroin to the UK. The news of the smuggling ring 
	operated by Mr. Momen surfaced immediately after the British High Commission 
	in Dhaka wrote to the Bangladesh government in 2005 asking it to investigate 
	a number of firms that had dispatched heroin hidden in consignments of 
	legitimate products to fake import companies based in London. Quite a 
	serious charge, indeed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Britain customs authorities were 
	alerted after three unclaimed consignments of street value $ 18.5 million 
	turned up at Southampton and Felixstowe last year containing heroin. The 
	British High Commission’s request in Dhaka had prompted the Bangladeshi 
	government to establish a committee to investigate. Soon it found that at 
	least five companies with close ties to BD Foods were involved in heroin 
	trafficking to Britain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The drug baron had other minions 
	working for him Bangladesh. The owner of another Bangladeshi exporting 
	company, Rainbow International, Kazi Zafar Reazul, has also admitted his 
	involvement in shipping 54kg of heroin to the UK in March-April 2005. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mind you, the ‘Get Rich Quick’ 
	scheme has its appeal to many people. The drug baron of Bangladesh was an 
	ardent practitioner of this “great” scheme. The government of Bangladesh was 
	too naïve to bestow a prestigious award to the drug baron for the last three 
	years in a row. What a shame! It remains to be seen how Mrs. Zia now handles 
	this fiasco, which will surely mar the “pristine” image of Bangladesh. It is 
	to be hoped that the court in Bangladesh would severely prosecute all those 
	people who were connected with the drug trafficking and that includes a host 
	of government officials. Next time someone becomes a tycoon in Bangladesh 
	overnight, the government should do a serious audit before bestowing any 
	coveted award to him or her or else, it would boomerang to haunt the Prime 
	Minister. She had already earned many dubious distinctions and the last 
	thing she needs an award for being the most naïve Prime Minister of a 
	populous nation. The “pristine” image of our motherland should be guarded by 
	us all, shouldn’t we?</font></p>
