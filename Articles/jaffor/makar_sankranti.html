  <p>Most blind belief systems (read religions) have invented rituals, special
  days, legends, folklore, etc., to build a rampart or bulwark to defend,
  define, and preserve their belief systems. The Muslim religion was started in
  sixth century with a very few legends or folklore. In that sense, the early
  Islam was truly a modern religion. However, as time passed, much folklore had
  infiltrated that simple religion. Now Islam can boast of having <i>Shabe Miraj</i>,
  <i>Shabe Barat</i>, <i>Urs</i> of one kind, or another, legends of Harut Marut,
  Yajjuj Majjuj, etc., to embellish the religion of peace. In Bangladesh, they
  have started a congregation on the bank of Turag River calling it Biswa Ijtema.
  In 50 years time, the river itself will become a holy one as Ijtema grows in
  popularity among the <i>Musullis</i> (devotees).<br>

  <p>The <i>Uno Numero</i> religion in India is not Islam but <i>Sonatan </i>Hinduism.
  This ancient religion is infested with so many bizarre tales, legends, and
  folklore that an entire 700MB of CD-R could be filled very easily with text,
  illustrations, and sketches to accommodate all the inanities that are rife in
  Hindu belief system. Some of these legends, folklores, etc., are so
  commonplace that they have become enmeshed in everyday life of many practicing
  Hindus all over India. The Hindu festivals are renowned for being
  jazzy-looking. There is a saying in Bengal ? ?<i>baro mashe tero porbon</i>?
  meaning, 13 festivals in 12 months, which epitomizes the love for festivities
  by Hindus. We all know about <i>Dasera</i> or <i>Bijoya</i> that is associated
  with <i>Jagroto Mata</i> (a living deity) Durga or Parvati. When Hindus take
  the <i>Protima</i> (statue) of Durga for <i>Bishorjon</i> (casting into a
  river) they say the Mother will be going to her father?s abode. However,
  little do they realize that the <i>Protima</i> will be heading towards Bay of
  Bengal and not towards Mount Kailash to the North where her father lives as
  per Hindu legend? Well, I bring this up to show one of the gross inanities of
  Hindu religion.<br>

  <p>The Hindus all over India is now getting ready to celebrate one of the
  greatest religious festivals that is known as <i>Makar Sankranti</i> or <i>Poush
  Sankranti</i> in Bengal. In Southern India, the same festival is known as <i>Pongal</i>.
  This religious festival has something to do with the position of the sun in
  sky. The Hindu astrologer believes that on January 14 every year the sun
  starts migrating to the north. Thus, it marks a new beginning as far as sun?s
  migration from tropics of Capricorn (<i>Makar</i> in Indian languages) towards
  equator. Our earth enters the constellation of <i>Makar</i> (crocodile) on
  first of <i>Magh</i>. According to astronomy as developed in the west, sun
  migrates to the imaginary line of topics of Capricorn on December 21 (the
  shortest day in Northern hemisphere and the longest day in Southern
  Hemisphere). But why do the Indian astronomers wait 24 more days to celebrate
  the northerly migration of the sun is a mystery to me. In any case, January 14
  is an auspicious day as per the Hindus all over India. Religiously (no pun
  intended), they celebrate the dawning of a new constellation <i>Makar</i>,
  which is a yearly event.
  <p>In Bengal, a big dipping festival unfurls on January 14 near Sagar Island
  where one branch of Ganges empty its water into Bay of Bengal. According to
  Reuters report, an estimated 300,000 devotees will gather at Sagar Island to
  dip in holy water at the confluence of Ganges and Bay of Bengal, which is
  about 90 miles from Kolkata. Many Munis and Rishis will come to Sagar Island
  for taking part in the festivity. Once every decade, the same festival takes
  place near Allahabad where Jumna River meets the Ganges, which the Hindus call
  devotionally the <i>Maha Khumbha Mela</i>. That festival is the largest
  congregation of Hindus in India. Two years ago in January 2001, the last <i>Maha
  Khumbha Mela</i> was celebrated.<br>

  <p>The <i>Makar Sankranti</i> is celebrated with lots of mirth making
  everywhere in India. They prepare special sweetmeat with sesame seed (til) and
  jaggery (unrefined sugar made from palm sap or <i>Tale?r Rosh</i>). In Bangla,
  we call it <i>Til?er Laddu</i>. Also, on this auspicious day, many Hindu women
  apply <i>halood-kumkum</i> or turmeric powder on each other?s forehead and
  children do fly kites because northerly wind is strong at this time of the
  year. Many devotees plunge into river water at Prayag, near Allahabad, at the
  confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna or Jumna River.
  <p>Because of the end of winter harvest, <i>Makar Sankranti </i>is also
  celebrated throughout India as a harvest festival. As someone wrote, ?It is a
  way of giving thanks to the elements of nature that help man.? In the coastal
  regions, this harvest festival is dedicated to Indra. In Tamil Nadu and Andhra
  Pradesh, it is celebrated as a three-day harvest festival. In Assam, they call
  the festival <i>Bhogali Bihu</i>, and in Punjab, the same festival is called <i>Lohri</i>.
  In North India, taking a bath in the river is considered mandatory on this
  day. According to a legend in the hills of Uttar Pradesh, one who does not
  take a bath on <i>Makar Sankranti</i> is born a donkey in his or her next
  birth. Some people think that the legend got started in cold climates to
  compel some of the more reluctant people to observe the basic rules of
  hygiene. <center><img src="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nirvana1/files/sankranti/sankranti4.jpg" width="410" height="328"></center>
  <center><b><font size="-1" color="#000099">Indian Sadhus chant devotional
  songs at Sagar Island (Photo: Jayanta Shaw)</font></b></center> The festivity
  of bathing in holy waters is accompanied with a big country fair or <i>Mela</i>.
  Thus, a rather large fair is held at the confluence of the Ganges and the
  Yamuna rivers at Triveni in Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh) on this occasion. Being
  the month of <i>Magh</i>, this fair is also called <i>Magh Mela</i>. Apart
  from Triveni, ritual bathing also happens at many places like Haridwar and
  Garh Mukteshwar in Uttar Pradesh, and Patna in Bihar. In Bengal, the place
  famous for <i>Makar Sankranti</i> is Sagar Island. As a child we also heard
  from our Hindu friends that many a place in rural East Bengal (Bangladesh now)
  they celebrate Poush Sankranti by hosting Mela and eating <i>Tileee'r Laddu</i>.
  Kite flying was also used to be a part of the festival.<br>

  <center><b><font size="-1" color="#000099">A Sadhu performs Yoga at the bank
  of Hoogly River near Kolkata (Photo: Suchita Das)</font></b></center> Many
  western news organizations have sent their photographers to Sagar Island and
  nearby towns who scoured the place to take some wonderful photos. I visited
  the Yahoo news site and found a plethora of colorful photos of devotees who
  are about to take a plunge into the cold river waters. Jayanta Shaw and
  Suchita Das took many of the photos for Reuters and Bikas Das did the same for
  AP. I gratefully acknowledge their skills and without their photos, this
  article that I hurriedly put together on January 13, 2003, would not have been
  possible. I am very interested in the rituals in which our forefathers have
  participated for over thousand of years. Hinduism is a part of life in rural
  India and one can see the religion in its full vibrancy through such festivity
  as <i>Makar Sankranti</i>.<br>
