    elsewhere in the Middle East but they have no qualms about the rise in

  <b><font color="#800000" size="5">The value of selling values grew</font></b></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  The value of selling values grew On Election Day, 36% of John Kerry's 
  supporters told exit pollsters that they weren't so much voting for their guy 
  as voting against President Bush. In contrast, only about 14% of Bush's 
  backers said the same of Kerry.</div>
<div>
  Nothing better explains what went wrong for the Democratic candidate: Kerry 
  was unable to communicate why people should vote for him.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  The exit polls, and much post-election spin, offered a ready explanation for 
  this. Twenty-two percent of voters listed &quot;moral values&quot; as their No. 1 
  concern, ahead of the economy, terrorism and Iraq. These voters turned out in 
  huge numbers, and they voted overwhelmingly for Bush. Election over.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  The polls also show that those who attend church regularly vote Republican. 
  So, the reasoning goes, the Democrats are out of touch with the nation's 
  values.</div>
<div>
  The interpretation is easily overdone. Not coincidentally, 23% in exit polls 
  also identified themselves as white evangelical or born-again Christians, a 
  core Republican constituency that isn't going to switch parties.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  But Kerry and other Democrats are lacking a compelling message to serve as an 
  alternative to Bush's platform of faith at home and resolution abroad. They 
  have policies on issues ranging from health care to welfare that have a moral 
  component. But they don't spend much effort explaining that dimension of those 
  values, which are the bedrock of their policies.
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  As Democrats regroup after their punishing loss, they will no doubt debate how 
  they can win back churchgoers, Southerners and other voters who see values 
  lacking in the Democratic message.
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  They won't find the answer in a fight to prove which party is more religious, 
  much less which side God is on. But defining core values and communicating 
  them clearly is a different matter. People want to vote out of inspiration, 
  not anger, and they didn't find enough in Kerry to attract their votes.</div>
