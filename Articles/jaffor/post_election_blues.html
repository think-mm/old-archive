  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On November 2, 2004, the voters of 
  America spoke quite clearly. A 51% of them sided with the conservative 
  candidate, George W. Bush while 48% of them voted for Senator Kerry. When all 
  the votes will be counted in Iowa and New Mexico, the 12 electoral votes held 
  by these two states will also go for Bush. Thus, the final electoral vote 
  counts will be as follows: Bush 286 and Kerry 252. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This year’s election gives legitimacy 
  to Bush’s presidency. In 2000, Al Gore had received nearly half a million 
  popular votes more than garnered by Bush. Moreover, the vote count in Florida 
  was mired with litigation and what not. Finally, to break the deadlock, the 
  U.S. Supreme Court had to intervene siding with the Bush camp. Taken all of 
  these facts together, Americans were not comfortable with the legitimacy of 
  Bush’s ascendancy to power. George Bush had to fight this stigma everyday as 
  he sat in the Oval Office. He must have heaved a great sigh of relief today 
  (November 3, 2004) knowing that he garnered 51% of the popular votes. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today—the day after Election Day, Nov. 
  2—was particularly a rough one; it was a day of reckoning for millions of 
  liberals in America. Their candidate was defeated in the election. The win was 
  a resounding victory for Religious Rights—the Neo-cons. Bush’s campaign 
  manager, Karl Rove, who architect this win had received a pat on the back when 
  Bush addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Washington D.C. to break the news that 
  Senator Kerry had called him to concede the election to him. Mr. Bush 
  profusely thanked Karl Rove while calling him “the Architect” of Republican 
  Victory. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people do not know who Mr. Karl 
  Rove is. Mr. Rove also managed Bush’s 2000 campaign. His election strategy 
  right from the beginning was to energize the rightist elements of American 
  society. The Republican Party had courted the Religious Rights and 
  conservatives since the unsuccessful campaign for the White House in 1964 when 
  the party nominated Senator Barry Goldwater to run against a populist 
  President by the name Lyndon B. Johnson. The Republican Part lost very badly 
  in that election only winning six southern states in the Bible-belt of America 
  with 52 electoral candidates, whereas President Johnson captured 44 states 
  with 494 electoral votes. Now, that was a landslide victory! Many historians 
  now think that the defeat in 1964 was not a total loss for Republicans. The 
  party moved to the right from center of the political spectrum. It took them a 
  while to build their new political constituency based solely on conservatism. 
  This cycle was completed in 1980 when Ronal Reagan ran against the centrist 
  candidate President Jimmy Carter. While the Republicans were very much 
  immersed in conservatism, the Democrats were moving slightly to the left. In 
  1972, Senator George McGovern ran against President Richard Nixon with an 
  anti-war platform only to see that the president garnered an astounding 520 
  electoral votes. Another political landslide, of course. Senator McGovern 
  carried only the state of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia receiving 
  pitiful 17 electoral votes. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Democrats learned a lifetime 
  lesson from the ignominious defeat in 1972. The party moved to the center in 
  1976 capturing the White House while electing Jimmy Carter as the president. 
  Then the mood of the nation soured and the nation moved to the right in the 
  heydays of the Cold Water. The nation then elected a rightist candidate, 
  Governor Ronald Reagan of California. The streak of conservatism ran 12 long 
  years. The Democrats then engineered to take back the White House; they did it 
  by moving to the right side of political spectrum while they nominated Bill 
  Clinton, who never claimed to be a liberal politician. This did the trick; the 
  Americans voted for him in droves in 1992 and again in 1996. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2000, the Republican Party courted 
  the Moral Majority—a hodgepodge of Evangelists from southern states—running a 
  campaign based on ultra-conservative themes. Karl Rove engineered this scheme. 
  They did the same with but with much vigor in 2004. Do you remember the three 
  debates in September and October of 2004? President Bush tried to put 
  “liberal” label on Senator Kerry. This was a calculated move by the 
  Republicans. Karl Rove’s strategy was to label Kerry and Edward ticket as a 
  leftist liberal ticket and to spook the voter allover America. In my view, 
  this tactic worked to sway 3-4 million crucial voter nationwide. If you look 
  carefully the vote tally, you will see that Bush had received 3.7 million more 
  votes than what Kerry had garnered on November 2, 2004. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This morning (November 3), 50 million 
  plus liberals in America had received theirs wakeup call. Let us face the hard 
  reality that there are more conservatives in America. As long as the 
  Republican Party runs presidential campaign in the future with conservative 
  platform, they will beat the Democrats hands down in every election. This is 
  the take home message from the election of November 2, 2004. The liberals did 
  not learn the hard lesson in the aftermath of defeat in presidential election 
  in 2000 by Al Gore. To capture the White House in 2008, the Democrats have to 
  look for a centrist candidate or else the same fate waits for them four years 
  from now. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The liberals are very perturbed now in 
  the aftermath of Kerry’s defeat. The Kerry campaign ran a near flawless 
  campaign touching their constituency but in the end, it mattered a little. 
  Karl Rove’s gang had spooked the growing neo-cons and all streaks of 
  conservatives by driving home the point that if Kerry is elected, he would 
  ruin the dreams of millions of neo-cons by making this great republic into a 
  welfare state where lesbian and homosexual couples will be united to lead 
  their family life, tens and thousands of fecund women will sell their embryo 
  for lucrative stem cell research, and on top of this al-Qaeda will blast off 
  nukes everywhere to make the life of Americans miserable. After all, scare 
  tactics have worked in the past, it worked now, and the future neo-cons and 
  conservatives will use it to unify their base. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under this bleak scenario, there is no 
  chance for liberal candidates to win back the White House. The liberals should 
  take this ominous development in America with stride. There is a fair chance 
  that America could import this new-fangled ideology to other nations on earth 
  with disastrous result. The proverbial chicken will come to roost. Therefore, 
  some action is necessary to redefine liberalism in America. Perhaps the 
  liberals should stay a million mile away from lesbians, homosexuals, and other 
  fringe groups just to foil Karl Rove’s nasty intrigue if they want to capture 
  the White House in 2008. </font></p>
