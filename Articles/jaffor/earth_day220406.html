	<p align="justify">I<font face="Verdana">n 1970, a group of ecologists and 
	earth-lovers in America decided to set aside a day for our Mother Earth. I 
	was in America then as a graduate student in Ohio. In college campuses small 
	groups of people celebrated the day without much fanfare. Even though it was 
	an uneventful day, it engendered some thoughts among eco-friendly people — 
	how to save our one and only earth? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1960s, the Vietnam War was raging 
	in Southeast Asia where the U.S. Army sprayed noxious chemicals to defoliate 
	plants to gain some tactical advantage over Viet Cong guerrillas. In upstate 
	New York near Niagara Falls, industries were dumping so much industrial 
	waste into Love Canal that fish could live no longer in waterways. There 
	were telltale signs everywhere that earth’s fragile ecology was degrading 
	fast but not quite noticeable to laymen’s eyes. For some thoughts on that, a 
	handful of people mostly in college campuses gathered to protest the 
	degradation of earth’s ecology. They urged everyone to set aside a day to 
	talk about our earth’s environmental problems. That is the way Earth Day was 
	engendered. For the last 36 years, the western world had been celebrating 
	this day and its popularity is increasing year-after-year. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, in big urban 
	metropolis, where environment is taking a big toll due to loss of forest to 
	accommodate more people, we do not hear much about Earth Day celebration. 
	This however is not true for college campuses and smaller towns. In the last 
	year I moved from a big urban sprawl to a smaller community in upstate New 
	York. One thing I noticed right away. Here, people are more eco-friendly. It 
	hardly comes as a surprise knowing the education level of people in Cornell 
	campus. There are far too many parks in Ithaca considering it is such a 
	small town. The parks are kept in pristine condition, no dog excrement or 
	discarded coke bottles lying anywhere in the ground. The city collects 
	recyclable materials on alternate weekend. All in all, I was impressed. This 
	is the way a city ought to look like and conduct its affair – in an 
	eco-friendly way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">New York City is only 4-5 hours 
	drive from Ithaca. I visited the city once about two months ago and what a 
	contrast! Coke bottles and other waste materials from fast food places had 
	strewn the roads in Queens; the same goes for other Burroughs of the Big 
	Apple (the other moniker of NY City). Look what overcrowding has done to 
	American cities. The big city folks would never know what they are missing. 
	The quality of life in small towns is so much better that I wonder whether 
	it is worth the while to live in an urban sprawl. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I almost forgot about this year’s 
	Earth Day celebration had I not receive e-mail from a friend. The mail had 
	enough info about the day’s program, which gave me a pretty good description 
	of what will be going on here on that celebratory day. Please keep it in 
	mind that in college campuses people tend to be more conscious about 
	environs as compared to city folks. In America, many eco-friendly folks 
	won’t even take a higher paying job in cities. Therefore, on Earth Day you 
	tend to see folks from rural areas and college campuses becoming proactive 
	and joining the celebration. In Ithaca, people will gather in a farmers’ 
	market that is located at the south end of Cayuga Lake where all-daylong 
	activities are planned. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A cynic might say, “What is the 
	point in celebrating the Earth Day when mankind had all but ruined the 
	environs!” This is an a-OK statement but how could we, the earthlings, be so 
	insensible. All is not lost as far as our ecology is concerned. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The industries in West were ruining 
	our earth’s ecosystem in the last 225 years. The world ushered in Industrial 
	Revolution in the late eighteenth century and the cities became the hub of 
	the factories. Soon, European cities started to grow a la mushroom. The same 
	thing happened in America and Asia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Please look at what happened to 
	sleepy town of Dhaka and Bangkok. Dhaka’s population was half a million in 
	1950s. In the last 55 years it grew to about 8-10 million. The city could 
	not cope up with the population growth; consequently, heap of garbage lays 
	everywhere and the traffic hardly ever moves in the main arteries. The 
	pollution causing exhaust gas emanating from automobiles’ tail pipe is 
	horrendous. People must be suffering from lung-related ailments by inhaling 
	noxious gases and chemicals such as benzene, carbon monoxide, etc. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may say that the Third World 
	folks do not have the luxury to clean up their air. Development must go on 
	and it is a small price tag to pay for higher per capita income. The 
	environmental degradation in Bangladesh had caught the attention of many 
	professionals; thus, quite a few environmental NGOs are now operating in the 
	country and expatriate Bangalees are supporting the operational cost of such 
	NGOs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The other thought that I have on 
	this day is the population growth in certain countries. The world of ours is 
	teeming with about 6.25 billion people. In countries such as Bangladesh the 
	population is bursting at the seam. Only in 1950s there used to be 50 
	million people living in this tiny land. The population has tripled in the 
	last half a century. At this rate, this nation, which is as big as 
	Wisconsin, will have 200 million people by 2024 and 300 million by 2046. 
	Unfortunately, the land will not have the capacity to sustain that many 
	people. Ideally, Bangladesh should not have more than 40-45 million people 
	by Asian standard and 20-25 million people by western standard. The quality 
	of life there won’t improve substantially as long as the nation boasts 
	having 100 million or so. Migration of people to other countries is a 
	distinct possibility. Many people have left Bangladesh in search of greener 
	pasture, speaking metaphorically, of course. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In summary, the Earth Day will be 
	celebrated on April 22 this year. Through this short article I tried my best 
	to give the readers a sense of history about this important day. Many people 
	in the West now lament noting the environmental degradation that took place 
	in the last few decades. Many city-dwellers are now living in the suburbs 
	for various reasons but environmental factors being one of the prime 
	reasons. The folks who are living in small towns are very lucky because 
	these places are eco-friendly. For developing nations, the criteria for 
	being a pristine environment are different. There, the population is 
	bursting at the seam. Much environmental decay in those nations stems from 
	overcrowding. How could a nation like Bangladesh check its population? Maybe 
	a competent demographer has the ready answer. Humans should be optimists. 
	Let us hope that through sound eco-friendly legislations humankind could 
	improve the quality of air, water, and land. With these optimistic notes, 
	let me end this article. Have a happy Earth Day! <br>
