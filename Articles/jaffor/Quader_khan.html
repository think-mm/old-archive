  <p><font size="3">The architect of Pakistan’s Islamic Atom bomb, Dr. Abdul
  Qader Khan, and one of his top aids, General Mirza Aslam Beg, are now in
  proverbial political hot water. Contrast this news with that of the architect
  of India’s Saffron Atom bomb, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who is in limelight being
  selected in July 2002 by BJP as the president of the Republic of India. Both
  of them gave leadership to their respective nation’s nuclear bomb-making
  effort in the 1980s and 1990s, which had culminated in successful testing of
  the nukes in May and June of 1998. Both of these highly accomplished men were
  born in 1930s in India, Kalam in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu and Khan in Bhopal,
  Madhya Pradesh, but their career path took a sharp turn. While Dr. Kalam
  became the ceremonial president of India, his counterpart in Pakistan, Dr.
  Qadeer Khan did not fare that well. Mr. Khan and his military aid, Gen. M.
  Aslam Beg are about to be prosecuted under Pakistan’s ‘Official Secrets
  Act’ when that nation’s investigators unearthed some very damaging
  evidences that point out the duo’s involvement in selling nuclear secrets to
  Iran during 1980s. The Wall Street Journal on January 26, 2004 published an
  article on Dr. Khan and Gen. Beg’s complicity to sell Pakistan’s one of
  the top secrets to a neighboring Islamic nation. A senior Pakistani official
  was quoted by the journal to be the source of this revelation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">The authorities in Pakistan who are investigating the
  alleged wrongdoings of Dr. A. Qader Khan now say that they have traced quite a
  few bank accounts in foreign countries that were used by the Pakistani nuclear
  scientists Dr. Qader Khan and a fellow scientist, Mohammed Farooq, the WSJ
  article writes. The authorities in Pakistan believe that the scientists had
  received payments after passing highly secret documents relating to nuclear
  technology to Iran and other nations. Under this backdrop, it remains to be
  seen whether Pakistani President, General Pervez Musharraf, would give the
  green light to formally charge the scientists by the end of January 2004. The
  political nature of the case would make the Pakistani President shy away from
  giving his approval to sue the nation’s top nuclear scientist. Besides, Dr.
  Qader Khan has strong ties to Islamists in Pakistan many of who dislike
  General Musharraf for supporting the Bush Administration in rounding up al-Qaeda
  jihadists allover Pakistan. Is it possible for the Musharraf Administration to
  issue an arrest warrant for Dr. Qader Khan, Mr. M. Farooq, and General Aslam
  Beg because they had broken country’s ‘Official Secret Act’? We have to
  wait and see. General Musharraf may not take a risk lest his move may alienate
  a large section of Pakistanis comprising of clergies, jihadists, and patriots
  who abhor India for myriad reasons. Dr. Qader Khan is considered a hero and he
  plays a role model in Pakistan. Therefore, it could be a risky venture to
  arrest and humiliate him.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">General Pervez Musharraf has acted to &quot;rein in Islamist
  extremists,’ as pointed out in the WSJ article in the aftermath of September
  11, 2001, terrorist attacks in America. The Islamists may label the arrests of
  Dr. Khan and his associates as betrayal by the Pakistani president. Because of
  a large number of Pakistanis who ardently support Dr. Qader Khan, hundreds of
  Muslim hardliners had gathered in the capital city of Islamabad denouncing the
  government’s move to question the nuclear scientist and his aides. The WSJ
  article wrote, &quot;The prosecution of such prominent figures may prove
  embarrassing to the military, long Pakistan’s most powerful institution and
  one that brought Gen. Musharraf to power. The army has overseen Pakistan’s
  nuclear program for decades.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">It is true that Pakistani government had expressed in the
  1970s to undertake a mission to make nuclear bombs. The late Pakistani
  President Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto had once proclaimed that Pakistan ought to make
  nuclear bomb even if it means eating grass. This famous utterance by Bhutto
  came in the wake of India’s experimental detonation of atomic device in May
  1974 in Pokhran, Rajasthan, during Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s time. Pakistani
  military always wished to have their Islamic nuclear bomb in their possession.
  It became a prestige issue. Dr. Qader Khan – the Dr. Strangelove of Pakistan
  – was recruited to complete the job who knew how to enrich uranium by
  centrifugation. He learnt this job while he was in Germany in the 1960s.
  Because of his pivotal role in making Pakistan a member of the nuclear club,
  Mr. Qader Khan has received many accolades and encomium from his countrymen.
  He held the position of Pakistan’s main nuclear facility for 26 years. In
  2002, he was appointed an adviser to the government of General Musharraf.
  Because of his stature, the authorities did not detain him. However, he was
  asked not to leave the capital.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">The investigation of Dr. Qader Khan and his associates is
  not a homebrewed exercise. In November 2003, the International Atomic Energy
  Agency (IAEA) made the accusation that Pakistani scientists in the 1980s had
  helped Iran develop centrifuges to enrich the purity of uranium without which
  one cannot make any nuclear bomb. Dr. Qader Khan has expertise in this crucial
  area of nuclear bomb making. In the past the IAEA also have accused Pakistan
  of providing such crucial information to other rogue nations such as North
  Korea and Libya.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">According to the WSJ article the Bush Administration has
  been urging General Musharraf for the last two years to investigate how
  Pakistani nuclear scientists passed top-secret nuclear information to other
  nations. However, because of the urgency to apprehend al-Qaeda soldiers in
  Pakistan the Bush Administration did not press hard this issue to Gen.
  Musharraf’s regime. However, because of the events of last two months in
  which two assassination attempts have been made against Musharraf’s life,
  the General has finally changed his policy. He is now determined more than
  ever to go after the Islamists in Pakistan. His administration also wanted to
  know if there are any connections between the Pakistani nuclear scientists and
  the government of Iran and Libya. Whatever General Musharraf does with Dr.
  Qader Khan and his aid vis-à-vis selling of nuclear secrets to rogue nations,
  he does not like to come out as a stooge of Mr. Bush. An investigation to look
  into the matter of selling Pakistan’s nuclear secrets by Dr. Khan may be
  interpreted by his countrymen as a mini war against corruption by the
  government officials. In that way, the reputation of Dr. Khan will be
  tarnished. The corruption charge levied against Dr. Khan and his two
  associates if found to be valid, will confer General Musharraf the title of a
  warrior against rampant state-level corruption. This image may play out very
  well in Pakistan and strengthen Musharraf’s foothold into Pakistani
  politics.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">In his defense, General Musharraf said on January 23, 2004,
  that his administration is not acting at the behest of the U.S. or any other
  nation. He played the &quot;patriotism&quot; card rather well when he
  mentioned that he vowed to prosecute anyone found guilty of selling state’s
  secret. According to the WSJ article, Musharraf said in Davos, Switzerland,
  &quot;We will sort out everyone who is involved. [Our nuclear assets] are in
  extremely safe hands. We have ensured rings of security measures around that,
  especially since I took over in 1999.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">What will happen to the retired Army General Aslam Beg, who
  was one of the associates of Dr. Khan, is an open question. For one thing,
  Gen. Beg is quite well known for his anti-American rhetoric. He served as
  Pakistan’s army chief from 1988 through 1991. The transaction of nuclear
  secrets and money transfer took place at the time. It was reported earlier
  that the army chief came to meet the Mr. Nawaz Sharif, who General Musharraf
  deposed in October 1999 coup, in January 1991 when Sharif was the PM for the
  first time to discuss a proposal to sell nuclear technology to Iran for
  billions of dollars. General Aslam Beg then proposed that the money received
  from Iran could underwrite Pakistan’s defense-budget for the next 10 years.
  The General now says that he did not do anything wrong.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">The Pakistani ex-nuclear chief, Dr. Qader Khan, now told the
  investigators that he cooperated with Iran on nuclear technologies that were
  authorized by Pakistan’s top military commander. Dr. Qader Khan is known for
  his polemics. He is a staunch nationalist and holds strong views against West
  vis-à-vis theirs anti-Islamic views. The wild card in this game is
  Pakistan’s tens and thousands of Madrassah graduates and clerics. Will they
  rally for Dr. Qader Khan in the event he is arrested, put in a trial, and
  found guilty? Stay tuned for the next episode of this exciting development in
  Islamabad. You never can tell what is in store for General Pervez Musharraf.
  In the meantime Dr. Abdul Kalam, the President of India who was Dr. Khan’s
  counterpart in India must be watching all these new developments with an eager
  eye. By the stroke of a luck while he became the ceremonial President of
  India, his counterpart in Pakistan fell from grace by becoming an anti-West
  critic and staunch Islamist with his strident remarks. At this juncture, Dr.
  Qader Khan fits the following description, which was composed by Lord Byron:
  &quot;He stood a stranger in this breathing world, an erring spirit from
  another hurled; a thing of dark imaginings.&quot;</font></p>
