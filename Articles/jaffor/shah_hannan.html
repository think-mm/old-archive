										making outrageous claim vis-à-vis 
										defending Maulana Maududi’s political 
										doctrine and Jamaat-i-Islami’s political 
										role in the ill-fated government of 
										Khaleda Zia during 2001-2006.&nbsp; I decided

										posts.&nbsp; However, now I am compelled to 
										write this protest note against his 
										recent remark vis-à-vis <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s

										Unbeknownst to many of us who does not 
										know that Shah Hannan peddles 
										prevarication and ‘snake oil’ all the 
										time to promote Jamaati doctrine, this 
										time around the Islamic think tank guru 
										made a <i>faux pas</i> while hurting the 
										sensibilities of millions of Bangalees 
										residing in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> and 
										worldwide.&nbsp; The issue is <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										glorious War of Independence in 1971.&nbsp; 
										With the exception of Pakistani 
										literature peddled by Pakistani Army and 
										the government most scholars admit that 
										Bangalees were all united to fight 
										against the occupation force throughout 
										the 9 months in 1971.&nbsp; The fight for 
										independence that was started in March 
										26, 1971, ended on December 16 in the 
										same year.&nbsp; There was however the Fifth 
										Columnist allover occupied <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; They were the 
										supporters of Jamaat, Muslim League, and 
										the Bihari brigands to backstab the 
										freedom fighters. <O></O></font></p>

										period in which our <i>Mukti Bahini</i> 
										(freedom fighters) fought valiantly 
										against the occupation army of <ST1>
										Pakistan</ST1>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is Shah Hannan so 
										eager now to whitewash the sins of 
										Jamaatis, Muslim Leaguers, and Bihari 
										Razakars all with a broad brush?&nbsp; There 
										is after all a valid reason.&nbsp; The Jamaat 
										is in hot water now because if the party 
										could be labeled as the Fifth Columnist 
										who aided Tikka-Niazi-Yahya 
										administration during our Liberation 
										War, they could be barred from 
										participation in the next parliamentary 
										election.&nbsp; That is precisely why one of 
										the leading Jamaati politicians, Maulana 
										Mujahid, proclaimed the other day that 
										there are no war criminals in <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> at this time. &nbsp;By 
										making this outrageous statement, the

										“logically” follows – there would not be 
										single war criminal because it was not a 
										war in the true sense of the word.&nbsp; Now, 
										the Islamo Fifth Columnist and Islamic

										<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
										“By November [1971], the rebel

										especially likely to join the resistance

										Bodies of youths would be found in 
										fields, floating down rivers, or near

										terrorized all young men and their

										Many of those reluctant to leave their

										public statement when the topic is our

										Mr. Shah Hannan’s prevarication to give

										about <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s glorious 
										freedom fight.&nbsp; There are people who 
										think that if one makes a lie and say it 
										ten times then some gullible folks would 
										fall for that lie thinking that there 
										may be a truth in it.&nbsp; But so many books 
										have been written on <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										Liberation War that all the propaganda 
										that Mr. Hannan and Jamaati politicians 
										are making these days will go in vain. 
<O></O></font></p>
										<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
										The truth is that Jamaatis and their 
										ardent supporters such as Mr. Shah 
										Hannan were the eager Fifth Columnist 
										who was standing shoulder-to-shoulder 
										with vile Pakistani soldier to finish 
										off our Mukti Bahani soldiers.&nbsp; But that 
										did not happen.&nbsp; The glorious events of 
										our freedom fight were like the dark 
										chapter in Shah Hannan’s life.&nbsp; These 
										events torment him ad infinitum; 
										therefore, it comes as no surprise that 
										like a serpent he likes to strike back 
										at our glorious history.&nbsp; His recent 
										show of conceit in a private TV channel 
										is symptomatic of a delusional mind.&nbsp; If 
										he wants to live in a fool’s paradise, 
										then it is his prerogative.&nbsp; However, 
										for once he should come to terms with 
										the truth in respect to <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										Liberation War.&nbsp; This was the war in 
										which the Pakistani army and their 
										supporters had to face the ignominy of 
										defeat.&nbsp; History books are replete with 
										the number of casualties.&nbsp; Prof. Rummel 
										and Ms. Rounaq Jahan are right after all 
										when they wrote how many lives were lost 
										in the hands of marauding Pakistani 
										soldiers, al-Shams and al-Badars death 
										squad.&nbsp; Mr. Shah Hannan is only trying
