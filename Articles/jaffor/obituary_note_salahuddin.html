though Mr. Salahuddin was known for his legendary folk movie, Roopban, which he
made in the mid 1960s, he was one of the few creative directors who made earlier
such classic movies of Bangladesh as “Je Nadi Morupothe” (his first movie
made in early 1960s), “Dharapat,” “Surjasnan,” and “Tero Number
Fekuostagar Lane.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was among a
handful of directors in Dhaka whose work paved the way for rapid growth in
Bangladesh’s film industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
would be directors who had worked under him throughout 1960s were influenced by
his cinematic techniques.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a

cinemagoers of Bangladesh from yesteryears know him as a film director who made
movies based on real life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later he

instant hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This movie made a big
splash throughout erstwhile East Pakistan and especially in the rural areas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
