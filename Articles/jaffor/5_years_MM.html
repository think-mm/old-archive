	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mukto-Mona (M-M) is celebrating now 
	its fifth year birth anniversary; therefore, congratulations are due to the 
	founding moderators. It is a joyous occasion, undoubtedly. The cyber 
	organization had gone through the growing pains and a lot has happened 
	already. A few of the early moderators have left the forum for whatever 
	reasons while many new faces have replaced them. The forum is in strong 
	footing now; thus, another round of applause is due. Avijit, Jahed, Bonna – 
	you guys deserve all the plaudits from everyone who call this forum their 
	home away from home. We certainly are the proud denizens of Mukto-Mona. This 
	is where we slake our intellectual thirst. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How did I get involved with M-M? 
	Come to think of it, Jamal Hasan should get some credit for my being in this 
	prestigious forum. He told me in the summer of 2001 that an e-forum by the 
	name Mukto-Mona was formed and I should certainly become a member of this 
	newly formed group. At the time I was quite busy with the ‘News from 
	Bangladesh’ or NFB. My hands were fool and I was not in a mood to join 
	another cyber forum. Naturally, I postponed my participation in M-M forum; 
	however, I kept abreast of what was going on in this new forum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jamal Hasan told me that he found 
	Avijit in an obscure forum where he was debating endlessly with some Muslim 
	fanatics. Jamal liked Avijit’s style of arguments with the diehard 
	Bangladeshi Islamists. He then proposed to Avijit to visit NFB where Abul 
	Kasem, Syed Kamran Mirza, Fatemollah, and a handful of secularists were 
	locked in vicious debates of myriad kinds. The meeting of the minds took 
	place in NFB forum and the rest is what the cliché said, history. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Barely four months could pass after 
	the formation of M-M forum when Islamic terrorists struck America. This 
	mega-event gave a shot in the arm of M-M forum-goers. I became very busy 
	then while penning all kinds of editorials on 9-11. I realized then that 
	people were reading our articles that were critical to jihadism, 
	fundamentalism, obscurantism, etc. A reporter from Washington D.C. called me 
	at home seeking my interview. I saw that some of what I said during the 
	interview got into the article. I asked the reporter how did he get my name 
	and phone number. He said he did a research on Islamic fundamentalism in the 
	Net and my name came up very strongly in the search. From that I learned 
	what we do in the Net vis-à-vis writing against religious fanaticism is 
	getting the attention of key people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In October 2001, Bangladesh’s voters 
	went to the poll to elect parliamentary members. When the election results 
	came out some of us were very disturbed hearing the election outcome. Words 
	were coming out that the cards were stacked against the main secularist 
	party, the Awami League (AL). The head of the caretaker government, Justice 
	Latifur Rahman, in connivance with the chief election officer, and few 
	administrative officers had helped rig the election just enough to give the 
	four-party alliance a majority in the parliament. As soon as the results 
	were out, the goons belonging to BNP, Jamaat, and two other alliance parties 
	started a reign of terror targeting the Hindus on the premise that the 
	minorities vote for AL candidates. Some of us in NFB including Dr. Shabbir 
	Ahmed started a writing campaign to tell the world that Hindus in Bangladesh 
	were getting the shaft for voting AL candidates. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On December 16, 2001 I published an 
	article entitled “The Victory Day from minority’s perspective.” The next day 
	I received an invitation via e-mail from the moderator of M-M to join the 
	forum. The moderator requested me to send the article to the forum, which I 
	did [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/3795]. Since then, I 
	started sending my articles to Mukto-Mona regularly and I have continued 
	this practice to this date. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the last five years I witnessed 
	many a change in the forum. Initially, this was the place where a plethora 
	of articles and posts that were critical of Islam were posted. Also, 
	secularists who joined the group had vociferously complained about the 
	minority (from the standpoint of religion) repressions that got under way 
	immediately after the parliamentary election of October 2001. I also 
	remember seeing many posts relating to 9-11 terrorist bombings in New York 
	and Washington D.C. However, as the time passed by, the character of the 
	forum started changing. Quite a few regular members left the forum for 
	various reasons but their absence was not sorely missed; the new members 
	took up the slack and the forum was invigorated with the infusion of new 
	blood. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the later part of 2002 when 
	President Bush was making preparation for his unilateral war against Iraq 
	many members of our forum were really concerned about the fallout of Bush’s 
	misadventure; they posted articles, short comments opposing President Bush’s 
	idea. After that, M-M looked more like a global civil rights group. Because 
	of the overabundance of anti-Islamic articles and posts many outsiders 
	thought that our forum’s main goal was to demonize religion and in 
	particular Islam. Thus, I have seen other Bangladeshis mentioning M-M’s name 
	with their disparaging remarks. By this time I had joined M-M’s advisory and 
	editorial board and because of this, my contact with Avijit and other board 
	members grew and we were in constant touch with each other over various 
	issues. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most dramatic change in the 
	policy of M-M came when the U.S. election neared in November 2004. A bunch 
	of us in the forum took the side of Senator John Kerry, the Democratic 
	Party’s nominee, which had irritated some writers. After the election 
	results, a rift developed between the two groups. Consequently, a few of 
	them moved over to another e-forum. However, M-M’s loss was compensated by 
	the arrival of many new members and some of them were very enthusiastic 
	about the future of M-M. The identity of M-M had rapidly changed from being 
	an anti-Islamic forum to secularist forum that opposes civil rights 
	violation, and having such agenda as pro-democracy, pro-science, 
	pro-Darwinism, pro-rationalism, etc. Folks from divergent backgrounds could 
	still meet in this cyber forum and discuss myriad of issues – all 
	encompassing subcontinental, regional, global, etc. Some may view our forum 
	a meeting ground of social activists and I will ditto to that. We would do 
	our part to make our world a tad better; therefore, any action towards that 
	goal no matter how small it is would be a worthwhile cause. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mukto-Mona website received a much 
	needed facelift that took place perhaps in late 2004 or early 2005. It is a 
	lot easier now to find articles in the archive and the cataloguing of 
	hundreds of articles had made it easier to locate a specific article. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The forum is finally receiving many 
	submissions in Bangla, which should be a joy to our Bangla-speaking members. 
	I must say that most of the Bangla articles are original composition of many 
	talented members; however, this cannot be said about the English articles. I 
	wish M-M would receive more original full-length articles in English to 
	quench the thirst of non-Bengali participants. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From time to time, our forum 
	participates in celebration of joyous occasions such as Bangladesh’s Victory 
	Day, Independence Day, Bangla New Year Celebration, Darwin Day, 
	Rabindranath’s Birth Day, the Earth Day, etc. As you could see, these 
	celebrations center on secular events; on the contrary, the holidays with 
	religious underpinning do not receive any attention here. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The membership of M-M forum is 
	steadily growing, which is a healthy sign. Even though the forum was 
	initially formed by a small bunch of people from Bangladesh, now many people 
	from our subcontinent have joined the organization making it a premiere 
	forum for secularists. The perspective had changed from Bangladesh to global 
	and topic wise from the narrow confine of discussion focusing on 
	monotheistic religions to rationality, science, globalization, etc. M-M 
	writers are becoming widely known now in Bangladesh; thanks to the 
	publications of their works both in Bangla and English media. The forum has 
	already made inroads into various universities and colleges. It is 
	heartening to know that various enlightened bodies are celebrating 
	Mukto-Mona Day while holding seminars and discussions. As time passes by, we 
	expect to hear more news about such activities throughout Bangladesh. There 
	was a definite void in Bangladesh as far secular and scientific discussions 
	are concerned, I am glad to hear that Mukto-Mona is filling that void. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the future of M-M going 
	forward? If we keep up with the posting of good articles, commentaries, and 
	debates on myriad issues, more people would join our forum. Is it possible 
	to organize forums in various universities in Dhaka, Kolkata, Chittagong, 
	and few other cities in Bengal? Our idea is to spread secular humanism 
	movement allover our subcontinent. M-M has definitely taken the lead in this 
	regard. In my humble opinion amongst various forums in cyberspace our forum, 
	Mukto-Mona, is certainly a Jewel in the Crown? An overstatement? I hardly 
	think so. </font></p>
