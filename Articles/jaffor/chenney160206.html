	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><br>
	<font face="Verdana">The U.S. Vice President, who has a flare for secrecy, 
	is in deep trouble in the aftermath of February 11 quail hunting trip to 
	South Texas where he accidentally shot Harry Whittington, a prominent Texas 
	lawyer. It is a open season on Cheney for he failed to inform the police or 
	his boss, President Bush about the tragic incident that took place in the 
	ranch owned by Katharine Armstrong. News reporters are asking the White 
	House spokesperson, Scott McClellan, to explain the 22-hour delay in 
	reporting the incident to outside world. The constant badgering by the 
	newspaper reporters covering the White House had irritated Mr. McClellan so 
	much that he advised the newspaper reporters to ask Vice President's office 
	for an explanation. It seems as if President Bush wanted to distance himself 
	from the beleaguered veep. Is Dick Cheney already becoming a liability to 
	the president? We shall have to wait and see how this bizarre story develops 
	right before our eyes. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The shooting incidence took place at 
	about 5:30 pm after which the injured hunter, Mr. Whittington, 78, was given 
	the first aid by the veep's medical team. Later, he was transferred by 
	helicopter to a nearby hospital at Corpus Christie, Texas. Today (February 
	14), I read that a sheriff deputy showed up at the ranch. Who did call the 
	local law enforcement agent is not known. However, this much is known that 
	vice president’s people at the ranch turned the law enforcement officer 
	away. For whatever reason Mr. Cheney did not want to report the tragic 
	incident to police, news reporters or even to his boss, President Bush. 
	About 22 hours later Mr. Cheney broke his silence and let his boss know of 
	the accidental shooting at the ranch. This gap of 22-hours has become the 
	issue at this time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many analyst and political pundit 
	think that Dick Cheney has the flare for secrecy and he in appropriately 
	thinks he is above the law. Now that a prominent person is in the hospital 
	who the doctor said had a mild heart attack and pellets lodged in his heart 
	and skin, the press wanted to know all the gory details about the shooting 
	incident. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dick Cheney is now ducking the 
	reporters and keeping a low profile for the third straight day after 
	shooting his hunting partner; his office said that the veep telephoned the 
	victim after the man suffered a heart attack. Mr. Cheney is yet to express 
	regret publicly for wounding prominent Texas lawyer Harry Whittington in the 
	neck, chest, and face. In fact, his spokesperson tried to lay blame on aged 
	lawyer for not letting the veep know that he was there near a bush to 
	collect the bird he shot. Later, some hunting experts said that the shooter 
	(the veep in this case) should know his surroundings before discharging the 
	firearm. They squarely blamed Mr. Cheney for the tragic incident. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Physicians attending the millionaire 
	lawyer blamed birdshot that shifted to Whittington's heart for the episode 
	of a mild heart attack. They think that the victim's life was in no 
	immediate danger and no surgery was planned to remove the metal bits that 
	was discharged from Mr. Cheney's gun; nonetheless, the victim would have to 
	stay in hospital another week. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lucky for Mr. Cheney that he had no 
	public events on his schedule but he managed to duck a contingent of 
	reporters staking out a meeting he had with lawmakers. We learned from the 
	White House aides that Mr. Cheney had no plans to come forward with his 
	account of the incident. This is somewhat characteristics of the veep. 
	However, in my humble opinion Mr. Cheney will have to pay a heavy price for 
	his stubborn behavior. After all, he is holding a high public office a 
	heartbeat away from becoming the president of this great republic, which is 
	the leading nation of the free world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a humorous side of the 
	tragic incident. The comedians of the late night TV show are having a field 
	day with Dick Cheney. In today's newspaper, a whole slews of humorous 
	articles were printed. I get to read some of them in the Internet. Here are 
	some samplings. But first fasten your seatbelt, lest you fall from the 
	chair. Some of these jokes were outright hilarious. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Eugene Robinson, a syndicated 
	columnist, wrote, “Duck when Cheney's around.&quot; He further wrote, &quot;I told you 
	people Dick Cheney was dangerous. The man is out of control.&quot; (From: The 
	Seattle Times, February 14, 2006). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A blogger in Huffington Post wrote, 
	&quot;How embarrassing it is for those of us from Wyoming to have the most famous 
	person from this state do such a bone headed thing as to shoot his hunting 
	companion. It's probably a good thing he never put on a military uniform. He 
	would put a whole new twist on the term 'friendly fire.’ &quot; Another blogger 
	in the same web site wrote, &quot;All Americans Are Created Equal, But Dick 
	Cheney Is More Equal Than Others.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">David Letterman, in CBS's Late Show 
	on Feb. 13, 2006, said, &quot;Good news, ladies and gentlemen, we have finally 
	located weapons of mass destruction. ... It's Dick Cheney. ... We can't get 
	bin Laden, but we nailed a 78-year-old attorney.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In &quot;Wonkette.Com&quot; on Feb. 13, 2006, 
	someone wrote, &quot;Dick Cheney Finally Takes a Stand Against Trial Lawyers.&quot; 
	Republican candidates in 2004 election showed their dislike for trial 
	lawyers because John Kerry's running mate, Senator Edwards, was a very 
	successful trial lawyer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mark Leibovich, Washington Post 
	Staff Writer, wrote a hilarious piece on February 14 issue entitled, &quot;After 
	Cheney's shooting incident, time to unload episode triggers a fusillade of 
	wisecracks, and a withering blast from White House press.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In summary, it seems as if Dick 
	Cheney is in hot political waters after the terrible incident that happened 
	on February 11, 2006, in a South Texas ranch. The victim is now in a 
	hospital who suffered a mild heart attack. Mr. Bush's press secretary is 
	trying distance the veep from the president. In the meantime, White House 
	press is badgering Mr. McClellan with a barrage of questions. Many analysts 
	think that Mr. Cheney thought he was above the law. He has to pay for his 
	insolence. If his popularity plunges, the ultra-conservative Republicans who 
	support him will dump him in a hurry. This episode is going to run its 
	course; therefore stay tuned for more information. The Cheney episode has 
	only entered the second chapter and more is yet to come.</font></p>
