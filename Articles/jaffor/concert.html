  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><a href="concert/Shah_Rajaneeta.jpg"><img border="0" height="425" src="concert/Shah_Rajaneeta.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Every once in a while, you
  attend a cultural program that seems to etch your mind forever.&nbsp; Such an
  event happened on October 23, 2004.&nbsp; The venue was a local university
  (Southern University of New Orleans), the occasion was <i>Sharodio Utshab</i>
  (Autumnal festival).&nbsp; The local Bangalees of New Orleans gathered for an
  all day festivity.&nbsp; In the night, the organizer arranged a one-act drama,
  which was followed by a musical soiree by a duo from Houston, Texas, which is
  only 7-8 hours drive from New Orleans.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I was told beforehand that
  the female singer who will render some semi-classical Bangla songs is a
  classically trained singer from Kolkata and the tabla player is a reputable
  percussionist from Benares school of classical music.&nbsp; The combination
  could be deadly, I reckoned. I decided to record the entire 90-minute music
  recital and I got the permission from the organizer who also assured me that
  it wouldn’t be a problem as far the musicians go.&nbsp; Thus, I packed the
  boot of my car with recording gear that includes some quality condenser
  microphones, a state-of-the-art mixing board, a signal processor, and a
  digital recorder.&nbsp; Never mind an assembly of microphone stands, audio
  cables, headphone, etc.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The vocalist was Sangeet
  Bhushan Rajnita Banerjee who regularly had performed in All India Radio,
  Kolkata, and Mumbai for last 20 years.&nbsp; She also performed in Doordarshan,
  Kolkata.&nbsp; Her expertise in vocal music centers on classical and Nazrul
  Geetis for which she has received many encomiums.&nbsp; She received her first
  training from Kolkata’s legendary teacher Bimal Mitra at a tender age.&nbsp;
  Then she was student of Prasun and Meera Bandyopadhay (Patiala Gharana) for 15
  years.&nbsp; She also learned Nazrul Geeti from Purabi Datta, an expert Nazrul
  Geeti singer, and from Sukumar Mitra.&nbsp; Kolkata’s famous teacher Sri
  Jatileswar Mukherjee furnished her training in modern Bangla song for five
  long years.&nbsp; Ms. Banerjee had received far too many awards in many
  musical competitions in the last two decades.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><a href="concert/Rajaneeta_Banerjee.jpg"><img border="0" height="640" src="concert/Rajaneeta_Banerjee.jpg" width="425"></a></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000ff" face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Sangeet
  Bhushan Srimati Rajnita Banerjee at the concert</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The percussionist, Pundit
  Shantilal Shah, represents the Benares School of tabla playing.&nbsp; He
  received his training in Mumbai under Pundit Suresh Talwalkar.&nbsp; He has
  been playing tabla for more than 20 years and had accompanied very famous
  vocalists such as Pundit Jasraj.&nbsp; The expert <i>tabalchi</i> now lives in
  Houston where he is very active in the classical Indian music scene; he also
  teaches table to aspirant tabla player.&nbsp; Pundit Shah is a very sensitive
  tabla player who has not only mastered the art of tabla playing but his
  rapport with the vocalist, which I witnessed in the concert in New Orleans
  firsthand, tells me that he has a delicate sense of proportion who knows where
  to play a hard tabla and when to play a mellow style.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">In the concert, the duo
  played 14 songs starting at 10:15 p.m., which continued until 11:45 p.m.
  without any break.&nbsp; The selections covered the entire gamut of semi
  classical song, which we know them as Rag Pradhan Bangla Gaan, Kajri, Ghazals,
  devotional songs (Bhajan), etc.&nbsp; The duo also performed several songs
  from Nazrul Geeti, and modern Bangla songs.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal">
	<img border="0" src="concert/Shantilal_Shah.jpg" width="425" height="640"></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000ff" face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Pundit
  Shantilal Shah played some incredible tabla !</font></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The first number was an
  invocation to Vidya (Sangeet) Devi, which was followed by another invocative
  song called “Jago Nirmoyee, Chinmoyee,” Kajri—a folk song of Uttar
  Pradesh—“Piya Bena Ayee.”&nbsp; The fourth song was a selection from
  Begum Akhtar’s Ghazal—Aye Muhabbat—a grand light song of passion that
  made Begum Akhtar a famous Ghazal singer.&nbsp; Ms. Rajnita Banerjee did a
  very nice rendition of this famous song and Pundit Shantilal Shah also played
  a delicate tabla along with it.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The fifth, sixth, and the
  seventh songs were Rag Pradhan Bangla songs in Raga Kafi.&nbsp; The lyrics
  were: “<i>Bashoree Nishithe</i>” and “<i>Bajey Monjirey</i>” (a song
  recorded by Manobendro Mukhopadhya in the sixties) and “Korona Bhromor
  Gungun.”&nbsp; The 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> songs were Nazrul Geeti
  and the lyrics were: “<i>Shoi, Bhalo Korey Binod Benee</i>,” and “<i>Bhuli
  Kemone Ajo Je Mone, Bedona Shone</i>.”&nbsp; I have listened many a Nazrul
  songs all through my life but never before have I heard such a nice rendition
  of those songs.&nbsp; To prove my point I have asked Mr. Avijit Roy, the
  founding editor of Mukto-mona, a very popular secular e-forum in the Net to
  create links so that readers may listen to these two Nazrul Geetis and more
  songs to understand the delicate sensibilities of the two artists.&nbsp; Mr.
  Roy has done so.&nbsp; The four songs from this concert can now be auditioned
  through the Internet.&nbsp; These are in mp3 format.&nbsp; With an Internet
  connection and a PC with a 'media player' or 'RealAudio,' one could listen to
  these songs.&nbsp; All the reader has to do is click on </font><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jaffor/concert/">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jaffor/concert/</a>
  <font face="Garamond" size="4">and then select the song he or she desires to
  listen.&nbsp; At the end of this article, I am providing four separate links
  for these songs.&nbsp; One will find that the tabla playing in these songs are
  simply out of the world.&nbsp; All the bols and thekas are very clear and the
  emphasis and de-emphasis in '<i>thekas</i>' and baya tabla are very evident in
  the recordings.&nbsp; I urge any serious listeners to audition these
  selections.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The next three songs are
  all in Bangla and modern too.&nbsp; The 10<sup>th</sup> songs “<i>Amar Bolar
  Kichu Chilona</i>” were an adaptation from Hoimonti Shukla’s song.&nbsp;
  The 11<sup>th</sup> song “<i>E Kon Shokal Rater Cheo Ondhokar</i>” was a
  composition from Sri Jatileswar Mukherjee to express a profound sadness over
  the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984.&nbsp; The entire song was sung in
  an elegiac tone.&nbsp; The 12<sup>th</sup> song entitled “<i>O Tota Pakhire
  Shekol Khuley Oriey Debo Maa-ke Jodi Eney Dao</i>,” which was sung by
  one-time legendary singer of Kolkata, Nirmala Misra.&nbsp; The lyric of the
  song is a heart wrenching one in which a woman beseeches a caged bird to bring
  back the dead mother from other world.&nbsp; The program then ended with two
  more songs, one Bhajan, and a Rag Pradhan Bangla song entitled “<i>Koyelia
  Gaan Thama Ebar Tor Oi Kuhu Taan Bhalo Aar Lageyna</i>” a song of desolation
  for lover.&nbsp; The song was filled with pathos.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">How would I rate this
  concert?&nbsp; The readers may have guessed by now that it was a memorable
  evening that was filled with vocal music, harmonium accompaniment, and fine
  tabla playing.&nbsp; There was a magic in the air when they hypnotized the
  audience with theirs allure.&nbsp; The crowd was enthusiastic and mature.&nbsp;
  They appreciated the tenor of the music.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">We now live in an age of
  cheap entertainment provided by the “idiot box” littered in every house.&nbsp;
  In the West, people now have multiple TV sets in their home.&nbsp; The
  networks and TV stations are filling the airwaves with cheap programming.&nbsp;
  Throughout South Asia, the viewers get an earful of Bombay <i>Dhamakas</i> and
  noisy music with videos that show undulating body movement that goes by the
  name “modern dance.”&nbsp; The music that accompanies those dances has
  less melody but with a preponderance of western dance beat such as “disco”
  or “hip-hop.”&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The musical soiree of
  October 23, 2004, was a departure from all that that is distasteful and noisy.&nbsp;
  To listen to a sonorous voice who had mastered the art of <i>Thumri</i>, <i>Ghazals</i>,
  <i>Kajri</i>, Nazrul Geeti, <i>Bhajan</i>, etc., accompanied by a master tabla
  player was a delight to my auditory nerve.&nbsp; Needless to say, the evening
  will last forever in my memory, which will be supplanted by the audio
  recordings that I have made and which I turned into a CD of 78 minutes.&nbsp;
  When I crank the volume of my amplifier and play the CD, it sounds as if I am
  at the auditorium listening to the vocal music of Sangeet Bhushan Rajnita
  Banerjee and intricate tabla playing of a master percussionist, Pundit
  Shantilal Shah.&nbsp; Technology, when used appropriately, can do magic but
  when abused grossly, could cause pain.&nbsp; Then again, one man’s music
  could be another man’s noise.&nbsp; It is all in the ear of the listener, I
  suppose.</font></p>
