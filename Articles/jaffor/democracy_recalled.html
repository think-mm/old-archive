										<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">In 
										the West when a product manufacturer 
										occasionally does make hazardous 
										merchandise, the company is pressured to 
										recall it for fixing.&nbsp; Not a single year 
										that goes by when we do not hear a car 
										manufacturer recalling a particular 
										model of car.&nbsp; The factory defect is 
										repaired at manufacturer cost and the 
										item is promptly returned to the 
										consumer.&nbsp; This is the way to amend the 
										mistake a company makes when it makes a 
										lemon.&nbsp; A parallel thing is now going on 
										in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; Read on and 
										you will know what I am writing about</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><O></O></font></font></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">In Third 
										World countries such as in <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> we never hear the 
										recalling of a product whether it is a 
										formalin-laced fish or adulterated 
										cooking oil.&nbsp; Life goes on normally in 
										the idyllic place while consumers devour 
										adulterated foodstuff or operate a 
										faulty car.&nbsp; However, this cannot be 
										said about democracy, which was never 
										healthy but no one recalled it to fix or 
										mutate it.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Have 
										anyone heard about recalling a seemingly 
										defective democracy in the West?&nbsp; Hardly 
										so.&nbsp; But in the <ST1>Third World</ST1>, 
										democracy is recalled every so often 
										after a military coup.&nbsp; Remember October 
										1958 when <ST1>Pakistan</ST1>'s 
										constitution was abrogated by Field 
										Marshall Ayub Khan only to engender a 
										substitute by the name “Basic 
										Democracy.”&nbsp; Auyb Khan’s handlers 
										thought there are different kinds of 
										democracies in the world.&nbsp; Since 
										parliamentary democracy, which was in 
										vogue in <ST1>Pakistan</ST1> during mid 
										fifties, did not work as per military 
										leaders, they had to recall that 
										democracy and replace it with another 
										homegrown democracy the likes of which 
										were never seen before.&nbsp; Ayub’s Basic 
										Democracy was a far cry from true 
										democracy but that brand of democracy 
										was favored because it was manageable.&nbsp; 
										Some eighty thousand elected members 
										decided who would be the president.&nbsp; 
										Ayub Khan thought he could buy 40,000 of 
										those basic democrats to become the 
										president and guess what?&nbsp; He was 
										right.&nbsp; While Ayub was busily practicing 
										Basic Democracy in 
<ST1>Pakistan</ST1> many Bangalee politicians were protesting in the streets of 
										Dhaka, <ST1>Chittagong</ST1>, <ST1>
										Khulna</ST1>, and elsewhere.&nbsp; Sheikh 
										Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1>, was one of them who 
										never compromised with the Pakistani 
										military’s new brand of democracy.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><O></O></font></font></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">Gen. Moeen, 
										the head of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										military who is not a part of the 
										Caretaker government but is seen as the 
										strongman who is pushing the military’s 
										agenda through Fakhruddin Administration 
										in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>.&nbsp; The army chief is 
										following Ayub’s tried and tested method 
										of tinkering democracy.&nbsp; On April 2, 
										2007 he said before a selected crowd 
										comprising of political scientists that <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> will forego electoral 
										type of democracy and go for a “new and 
										improved” type of democracy, which will 
										be <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s own.&nbsp; Very 
										soon there will be a new entry in 
										Wikipedia on Moeen’s brand of democracy.<O><br>
										<br>
										</O>The intrepid and sapient army 
										General who has crisscrossed <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> in the last 80 days to 
										deliver his message on nation building 
										has finally spoken to a section of 
										nation’s intelligentsia.&nbsp; This time on 
										April 2, 2007 he spoke before political 
										scientists where he hinted that a new 
										type of homebrewed democracy will 
										replace the tried and failed democracy 
										that is flourishing in many nations 
										including <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										neighbor <ST1>India</ST1>.&nbsp; There is a 
										caveat here.&nbsp; In <ST1>India</ST1> the 
										military stays in the barrack and in 
										cantonment and the Generals do not 
										pretend to know everything a sapient 
										sage has to know.&nbsp; The military in <ST1>
										India</ST1> is under the control of a 
										civilian government and they honor the 
										constitution of the land.&nbsp; In <ST1>
										Pakistan</ST1>, however, this is not to 
										be the case.&nbsp; <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
										unfortunately follows <ST1>Pakistan</ST1> 
										in the matter of governance and 
										politics.&nbsp; Maybe, Gen. Parvez Musharraf 
										is Gen. Moeen’s hero.&nbsp; Like 
<ST1>Pakistan</ST1>, <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> will also follow a ‘Band Aid’ method 
										to govern the country following a 
										homebrewed democracy.<O></O></font></p>

										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana">In November 1975 <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> military came to power 
										through backdoor, unconstitutionally.&nbsp; 
										The General who took control of the 
										country with the help of tanks and 
										firearms also maimed the constitution 
										and then invented <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										very first “own brand” of democracy.&nbsp; 
										Perhaps this time around, Gen. Moeen 
										will also come up with a 2007 version of <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1>’s “own brand” of 
										democracy.&nbsp; Of course there are a 
										mélange of political scientists who are 
										just waiting to aid the general.&nbsp; 
										Through newspaper report we heard that 
										two political scientists and theorists 
										were brought from 
<ST1>Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA</ST1> who would counsel the Gen. Moeen to 
										accomplish this tough job.&nbsp; These flunky 
										political scientists are there nearby to 
										draft the blueprint of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										own brand of democracy.&nbsp; There is no 
										dearth of charlatan academics in <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> who would like to give 
										a glowing encomium to strongman.&nbsp; In the 
										past both Gen. Ziaur Rahman and Gen. H. 
										M. Ershad was guided by Bangladeshi 
										academics and constitutional experts who 
										could write the first draft of the 
										constitution to engender Bangladesh’s 
										very own brand of democracy.&nbsp; Come to 
										think of it, one barrister by the name 
										Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed helped Gen. Ziaur 
										Rahman to envision his “own brand” of 
										democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										</font></font>
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">In 
										summary, quite single-handedly Gen. 
										Moeen, the emerging strongman of <ST1>
										Bangladesh</ST1> had recalled democracy 
										because he thinks that it is sick and 
										infirm after getting abused by three 
										successive administrations.&nbsp; A body of 
										political troubleshooter has been 
										engaged by the military to come up with 
										the solution.&nbsp; More is yet to come; 
										therefore, stay tuned.&nbsp; Similar to <ST1>
										Pakistan</ST1>, in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
										also the military knows what is best for 
										the nation. Oh, one more thing I forgot 
										to add.&nbsp; <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>’s 
										military has a pristine background.&nbsp; 
										They don’t dabble in coups or regime 
										change and they are incorruptible.
