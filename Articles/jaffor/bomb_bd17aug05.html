	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The August 17, 2005, will go down in 
	the annals of Bangladesh history as the day Islamists blasted uncountable 
	homemade bombs allover Bangladesh . The idea was not to inflict bodily 
	injury, but to get maximum attention from the blasts. In that regard, their 
	objectivity was met; they received the “honor roll” or dubious distinction.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The news of the mini blasts made the 
	headlines all across the globe. This scribe read the news of the blasts 
	moments after they rocked Bangladesh in the Internet. Of all major news 
	networks, the AFP gave the maximum coverage. On top of it, Bangladesh ’s 
	newspapers also described in gory details the heinous incidences that mar 
	the good name of Bangladesh . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The government of Khaleda Zia, which 
	is so petrified every time someone says Bangladesh has become a new hub of 
	terrorism, has to swallow their own words as they gave glib answer when 
	bombs or grenades rattle the republic of 145 million. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Digging the archives of English news 
	dailies published from Dhaka will reveal a plethora of information on how 
	Khaleda Zia’s government, which is soft on Islamists, had abetted the goons 
	of Jagrata Muslim Janata of Bangladesh (JMJB) in western districts of 
	Bangladesh in early 2004. Under pressure from the donor nations, the 
	four-party alliance government headed by BNP finally outlawed the wayward 
	Islamic Party headed by Bangla Bhai. Before the leaders of JMJB went 
	underground later in 2004, their enthusiastic supporters took to the street 
	in Rajshahi in motorcades flaunting their newly gotten popularity. Now after 
	a year when the news of bomb blasts made headlines on August 17, 2005 in the 
	West, the name of JMJB came into fore one more time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was mentioned in the news that 
	the coordinated bomb blasts are probably the handiwork of Jamayetul 
	Mujahideen (JM) and another hard-line group, Jagrata Muslim Janata 
	Bangladesh. While the JM was banned earlier after their men fought pitch 
	battle in rural Bangladesh with police, the JM was reincarnated into JMJB. 
	The spiritual guru of the both the organizations is the same 
	ultraconservative Mullah who believe in Sha’ria Law and who wants to 
	institute Allah’s law (read Sha’ria) in Bangladesh. It is a small wonder 
	that police found handbills in bombsites allover the country those that are 
	written by JMJB. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh had been treading the 
	path of Wahhabi Islamism for the last three decades with disastrous outcome. 
	I have been vocal about it and so were quite a few Bangalee writers in the 
	Internet forums. One such forum is <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/">
	Mukto-Mona</a> (web forum of freethinkers and secularists from South Asia), 
	which was started by Mr. Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi doctoral student from 
	Singapore. However, every time we wrote about growing Islamism in Bangladesh 
	we were pooh-poohed by “patriotic” Bangladeshis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When veteran reporters Bertil 
	Lintner and Alex Perry wrote their articles on emerging fundamentalism and 
	terrorism in Bangladesh, then secularist writers and freethinkers gave their 
	kudos to the writers. However, “patriotic” Bangladeshis vilified Mr. Lintner 
	and Mr. Perry calling them sensationalists. Then again, in 2004, Ms. Eliza 
	Griswold, a renowned poet whose work is being published in prestigious New 
	Yorker and reporter at large for New York Times magazine, published an 
	article on Bangla Bhai phenomenon. Ms. Griswold also concluded that 
	Bangladesh had been treading the slippery slope radical Islam in recent 
	days. The government of Bangladesh found the NY Times magazine article very 
	“offensive” and distasteful. If my memory serves me right, the article 
	written by Ms. Griswold was banned in Bangladesh. After today’s news, who 
	could refute the conclusion of Mr. Lintner, Mr. Perry, and Ms. Griswold? 
	Never mind the myriads of article written by a whole bunch of secularists 
	from Bangladesh who saw nothing but evil in Bangla Bhai’s pet organization 
	JMJB. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From AFP news of bomb blasts in 
	four-corners of Bangladesh, we learned that about 350 bombs of various sizes 
	and strength were detonated over a period of one hour in 64 towns. Two 
	people died in the blasts while hundreds of people sustained injuries. The 
	motive of the blasters was not to kill fellow Bangladeshis but to tell the 
	civil society that the organization that did the coordinated bombings is a 
	mighty powerful one. The idea that this organization could organize such a 
	coordinated event should be a matter of concern. These folks are gung-ho 
	about bringing Sha’ria Law into Bangladesh. Thus, they boldly proclaimed 
	that they have no respect for manmade law (read: the Constitution of 
	Bangladesh); they would like to see Sha’ria as the law, which the bomb 
	blasters called Allah’s Law. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are other Islamic parties in 
	Bangladesh those are very vocal about instituting Sha’ria Law in Bangladesh. 
	They often take to the streets after Friday Jumma prayer and clash with the 
	police. These folks are keeping the momentum going. Nevertheless, they know 
	that the bulk of the civil society won’t go for such repressive and 
	antiquated set of laws. The hard-core Islamists are now using terrorism to 
	make their wish known to Bangladesh citizens. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The present government of Khaleda 
	Zia is responsible for the unprecedented growth of Islamic Constitution 
	Movement. She kowtowed the Islamists to win the election in October 2001. 
	The Islamic goons descended on minorities after the victory of the 
	four-party alliance of which three could be labeled as Islamic parties. As 
	goons from Jamaat and other Islamic parties unleashed a reign of terror, she 
	and her party lieutenants kept their lip sealed. The country witnessed an 
	onslaught of sectarian skirmishes allover Bangladesh. All the signs are 
	there for growing sectarianism in Bangladesh. But the government won’t raise 
	its finger against the Islamists. The reason is very clear. Khaleda Zia’s 
	party, BNP, has to kowtow the Islamists if she wants to win any future 
	parliamentary electron; the next one is slated for late 2006. The Islamists 
	know this for a fact and that is precisely why they are thumbing their nose 
	at the present government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The police in Bangladesh are not 
	taking the events of August 17 seriously. In AFP report, it was mentioned 
	that Abdul Kaiyum, Bangladesh's Inspector General of Police (IGP), said, 
	“These were small, homemade bombs designed to create panic.” How could the 
	IGP say such a foolish thing? A bomb blast is a blast. In the eyes of 
	police, terrorism no matter how small its scale is should be considered the 
	act of terrorism. The police are trying to downplay the incidences of 350 
	bomb blasts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The home ministry is also acting 
	rather naively when a statement from the department read, “After analysing 
	all the incidents it is assumed that the main aim of the explosions was to 
	create panic and to create a destabilised situation in the country.” We all 
	know that blasting small homemade bombs could hardly do much damage and kill 
	people but the government is misreading the incidence of August 17 bombings. 
	The fact that the organization could coordinate and execute such a 
	complicated scheme of bombings in 64 towns within a specified time should 
	give a chill. The organization has some grassroots support and have the 
	capability to do harm to Bangladesh’s ordinary people – this is good enough 
	for giving the government a real shock. All this downsizing of the impact 
	from the blasts serves no real purpose. The government should sternly deal 
	the growing menace of bomb blasts and squish the Islamic Constitution 
	Movement, which is growing à la cancer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, the JMJB men should be 
	rounded up from all districts of Bangladesh. The government agencies running 
	the intelligence know the identity of Bangla Bhai goons. The Prime Minister 
	and her cabinet ministers should stop giving a lip service while not 
	addressing the growing menace of terrorism that is being perpetrated by 
	Islamic terrorists. The longer the government waits the more powerful the 
	terrorists will become. Catch them when they are inexperienced or else face 
	the consequence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The bomb incidences of August 17, 
	2005, should not be taken blithely. Either the government should squish the 
	Islamic Constitution Movement at this time or the civil society will face 
	Islamists’ wrath in the near future. The BNP and her alliance members have 
	been nurturing the proverbial cobra – the hooded serpent – all these days 
	with milk and banana only to find that the serpent is expanding its hood too 
	early to bite the masters. Won’t it be easy to kill the hooded serpent at 
	this time or face serpent’s wrath in near future? </font></p>
