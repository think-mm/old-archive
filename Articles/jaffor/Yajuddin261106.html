	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yajuddin Ahmed’s ascension to power 
	in Bangladesh was dramatic. Virtually an unknown person, politically 
	speaking of course, in Bangladesh, he was nominated to be the president of 
	Bangladesh by Khaleda Zia, the chief of BNP, in September 2002 when 
	ex-president Badruddoza Chowdhury was booted out of the office because he 
	did not follow the dictums of BNP leader’s to remain neutral, which is what 
	Dr. Chowdhury wanted to do to bring gravitas to the highest position in the 
	land. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Yajuddin, an extremely partisan 
	president, has become a controversial person as he steers the troubled land 
	of 145 million at this difficult time when opposition political parties are 
	united together to demand reform in the electoral process so that a fair 
	election could take place in January 2007. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before mid-October 2006, the 
	fourteen-party opposition alliance had been pressing for the dismissal of 
	the future caretaker government chief, retired justice K.M. Hasan, on the 
	ground that the man cannot be trusted to be neutral. They also demanded that 
	the chief of the Election Commission, retired Justice Aziz, should be 
	removed along with a handful of election commissioners fearing that an 
	election engineering could be in the offing if they are allowed to stay in 
	the office. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In late October 2006, a political 
	stalemate resulted when the entire country was brought to standstill by the 
	combined opposition on the issue of the removal of Justice Hasan’s name from 
	becoming the next chief of the caretaker government when Khaleda Zia’s term 
	ends in the last week of October 2006. On October 28, 2006, Yajuddin Ahmed, 
	became the chief executive of Bangladesh’s government by becoming the chief 
	of caretaker government. His detractors say that he had grossly violated the 
	constitution of Bangladesh for not following the procedure outlined in it. 
	Under pressure from the opposition political parties Justice Hasan withdrew 
	his name from becoming the next chief of the caretaker government. There 
	were other justices available to fill the slot but Yajuddin Ahmed did not 
	follow the guideline and declared himself to be the next chief of the 
	caretaker government. The opposition was surprised by this unprecedented 
	development; they however accepted the nomination with precondition that 
	Yajuddin would act neutrally to conduct the election. Within a short time, a 
	ten-member advisory board was formed to conduct the business of the 
	government. Unlike Yajuddin, the advisors were non-partisan who were very 
	willing to help the president steer the nation for a fair election. But 
	wait! The story becomes very interesting as Yajuddin shows his real color.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even though the ten advisors took 
	oath for the office but Yajuddin decided not to consult them on national 
	matters. He was seeking advice from leftover bureaucrats loyal to departed 
	Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, on such sensitive matter as bringing army to 
	street to quell mass protest against reformation of nation’s Election 
	Commission. Buckled under pressure, Yajuddin had to revoke that order that 
	he signed so eagerly hours earlier. Regarding army mobilization in certain 
	areas he kept his advisors in dark creating all kinds of miasmas. This 
	monstrous gaffe did not bother him that much though. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mind you that being a research 
	professor all his life Yajuddin had no background in law. And that showed up 
	in a big way when he quipped that Bangladesh had entered a presidential 
	rule. Yajuddin forgot very conveniently that he is wearing two hats. One 
	that of the president and the other that of the caretaker chief. He thought 
	of him as a mini dictator and for that reason he did not have a dialogue 
	with his advisors. The newspapers coming out of Dhaka published all kinds of 
	stories relating to a developing acrimonious relationship between him and 
	his advisors. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The opposition parties in Bangladesh 
	were asking Yajuddin to sack Justice Aziz from the position of the chief of 
	the Election Commission. The advisors of the caretaker government also 
	hopelessly tried to persuade him to fire the obstinate EC chief but he was 
	reading from the script written by BNP operatives. Soon the advisors 
	understood very easily that Yajuddin is a partisan president and he was 
	acting to preserve the interest of one political party. Again, when pressure 
	from all corners became unbearable, he let KM Aziz go on vacation for 90 
	days. In reality, Aziz won’t be coming back to reclaim his position because 
	the election would take place in the next 90 days. The opposition alliance 
	now says that they do not trust the remaining commissioners of the EC but 
	Yajuddin is noncommittal on removing the partisan members from the 
	commission. It seems as if Yajuddin is reading from the script written by 
	someone who is not part of the caretaker government. The ten-member advisors 
	are aware of Yajuddin’s recidivistic attitude and his fondness for 
	partisanship. He is yet to fathom out the gravity of the situation. Needless 
	to say, all eyes are on him. He will find it extremely difficult to 
	extricate him from any failure that may emanate if his partisan action may 
	lead to an election debacle in January 2007. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I am writing this piece, another 
	gaffe is unfolding centering on the liaison between the remnants of 
	BNP-favored bureaucrats and BNP. The opposition political parties have been 
	saying all along that the Khaleda Zia Administration had left enough 
	sycophant bureaucrats in the government who could tip the election in favor 
	of the BNP. Therefore, they urged Yajuddin to do something about the civil 
	administration but he is turning a deaf ear to opposition’s plea. The 
	caretaker advisors realizing the problem also wanted to remedy this inequity 
	in civil administration. However, they quickly found out that Yajuddin is 
	both nonchalant and oblivious to this growing problem. On November 24, 2006 
	a secret meeting took place in the northern suburb of Dhaka between the 
	government bureaucrats and a BNP politician and the press learned about the 
	rendezvous where they took photos of the government cars outside the meeting 
	place. The ten-member advisors are calling for the firing of the government 
	bureaucrats; however, it remains to be seen if Yajuddin takes any action to 
	discipline these rogue government high officials. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has been only 30 days that 
	Yajuddin took the charge of the caretaker government in Bangladesh but he 
	made him a controversial president by his partisan action; he has hard time 
	distinguishing right from wrong. The caretaker government should maintain 
	neutrality, which had been the case in last two elections, but Yajuddin 
	Ahmed being an ardent supporter of BNP has already made him a controversial 
	head of the government. Stay tuned for more political and administrative 
	gaffe that will unfold in days ahead. This educationist who prides in being 
	in academia for his entire life is making errors in judgment only because he 
	is reading from prepared script written by his party. Every time he meets 
	Khaleda Zia for a meeting he changes his position abruptly on issues that 
	has bearing on election outcome. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One could only hope that Yajuddin 
	Ahmed show good judgment at this critical juncture and steer the nation for 
	a fair election. Whether that will happen or not is unknown. Based on his 
	political acumen if he listens to his advisors, he may go down in the 
	history of Bangladesh as a caretaker chief who performed well on the face of 
	a lot of political pressure or if he bungles then his epitaph would say that 
	this is the man who crumbled on the weight of partisanship. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On a personal note, I had the chance 
	to meet Yajuddin several times as a student during 1966-67 when he was a 
	young professor visiting Mymensingh as an external examiner in soil science. 
	It never crossed my mind that forty years later this man’s action could seal 
	the fate of a party that looted billions of dollars from both public and 
	private funds. If my memory serves me right, Yajuddin was a Muslim Leaguer 
	who was taught by Dr. M.O. Ghani, another ardent supporter of General Ayub 
	Khan and an odious Muslim Leaguer by the name Monem Khan of Mymensingh. Did 
	Mr. Yajuddin join Bangladesh’s liberation movement in 1971? Not that I know 
	of. But how ironical it is that this ex-Muslim Leaguer by the luck of a draw 
	has become the man of the moment. Yajuddin owes it to Khaleda Zia for his 
	rapid ascendancy to national scene. And like a fawner he is showing his 
	obsequiousness rather blatantly and thereby plunging the nation into a 
	quagmire from which a rescue would be difficult. Let us all hope that the 
	ten-member advisors would work as a team to thwart his partisan action.
