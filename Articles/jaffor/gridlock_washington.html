	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Democratic Party that was out of 
	limelight for 12 years did it in a big way on Tuesday, November 7, 2006. 
	Most political pundits thought the Democrats could take control of the lower 
	house (House of Representatives) but in reality they took control of both 
	the lower and upper house (the Senate). At the last count, the Democrats 
	have own 51 seats in the Senate (including one independent and one Democrat 
	running as an independent). The two independents have said that they would 
	caucus with the Democrats. Thus the entire Congress is now under Democratic 
	Party control. What does it really mean? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For one thing Mr. Bush will not be 
	able to pass his favorite bills through Congress. Second, now that all the 
	important committees in both the Senate and the House will be controlled by 
	Democrats, they would set up which bills will go to the floor. Mr. Bush 
	knows already that his power will be curtailed severely and as a gesture of 
	goodwill he called upon the future speaker of the House, Ms. Nancy Pelosi, 
	to join him in today’s breakfast. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To show a gentler and kinder side, 
	Mr. Bush has already softened his position on Iraq. The day after the 
	Republican Party was ousted from power both in the lower and upper house, 
	the ignoble secretary of defense, Mr. Donald Rumsfeld, tendered his 
	resignation. Mr. Rumsfeld is on the way out. A deafening silence had 
	descended upon vice-president’s office. We are yet to hear any comments on 
	the failure of the Grand Ol’ Party (the moniker of the Republican Party) to 
	capture majority of seats in both the House and Senate. The same goes for 
	Mr. Karl Rove, the architect of 2000 and 2004 victory for the Republican 
	Party. Many political commentators have said that Mr. Rove may have a secret 
	plan to bring voters to Cast their votes in favor of the conservative party 
	but that fizzled out. Mr. Rove did not realize that morality was not the hot 
	button issue in 2006. It was all Iraq, corruption in the high offices, no 
	entitlement (social security) reform, social justice (increase the minimum 
	wage). The issues that resonate with Republicans such as fight the 
	terrorist, regime change in abroad, abortion, patriotism, etc., took the 
	back seat in this election season. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only few days ago in one of the 
	several stump speeches a combative Mr. Bush said, “Terrorists win and 
	America loses” if Democrats won on Tuesday. However, all the rhetoric is 
	gone now and Mr. Bush knows very well that he has to work with a tough 
	legislative branch and gone are the days when the president was able to pass 
	any bill to his liking. One thing is for sure, the new Congress will do 
	everything to bring home the American servicemen from Iraq. How quick 
	though? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Once the new Congress convenes, 
	there won’t be any talk about tax cut for the rich, instead, we will hear 
	about setting the nation’s agenda; the newly elected members in both houses 
	would talk about raising the minimum wage, funding stem cell research and 
	authorizing the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices for 
	Medicare patients, cutting student loan interest rates, to name a few. The 
	domestic agenda would again dominate the next Congress. In the last six 
	years Mr. Bush was too busy shaping the world with his own ideas and 
	consequently the foreign issue had dominated the politics in Washington D.C.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We are going to see a combative 
	president in the next two years and perhaps Mr. Bush is already started to 
	sharpen his pen for vetoing any bill not to his liking. It is noteworthy 
	that the president only used his veto power once in the last six years. I 
	strictly remember Richard Nixon used to veto for infinite time as both the 
	upper and lower house were controlled by the Democrats. This is what was 
	called a gridlock in governance. The same is going to happen now. The bills 
	that will be dear to the Democrats in Congress will be vetoed by Mr. Bush 
	and in return the Democrats will make sure that the president’s bill is not 
	passed so easily. Mr. Bush has to comprise his bills and negotiate with Ms. 
	Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid who is going to be the majority leader 
	in the Senate. In the last six years Mr. Bush has all but ignored the 
	Democrats but all that will change in a hurry. It remains to be seen how Mr. 
	Bush would cajole the Democrats. America’s financial world, The Wall Street, 
	loves the gridlock in Washington. In theory, Mr. Bush will not be able to 
	rack up the budget deficiency by expanding war on global terrorism. The U.S. 
	corporations will make more money if more dollars are pumped into the 
	domestic economy. With this anticipation the Wall Street started rallying in 
	October and November this year. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The day after the election Mr. Bush 
	signaled his readiness and readiness to work with the Democratic leaders in 
	the Congress. To this effect he said he may entertain some of the Democrats’ 
	pet ideas, such as minimum wage, and to seek compromise on his own agenda, 
	such as renewing the No Child Left Behind education law. He is also willing 
	to overhaul of immigration laws — blocked so far by his own party men who 
	wanted to see a tougher bill. How strange that Mr. Bush’s immigration bill 
	stands a better chance in a Democratic Congress. On the other hand, the 
	Democrats’ favorite alternative energy sources may also provide grounds for 
	compromise. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, there are some Republican 
	strategists who think there will be some severe gridlock in the legislative 
	branch of the government. “You'll have a bare minimum of legislation,” said 
	Ed Rogers, who worked in the White House during 1989 through 1992 under 
	Bush’s father. A pessimistic Mr. Rogers said, “You’ll have aggressive — 
	bordering on hostile — oversight. The Democrats — they’re not going to be 
	able to do much legislatively that he’s going to sign.” Another Republican 
	consultant, Charles Black quipped, “An ugly couple of years with not a ton 
	being accomplished.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This scribe also thinks that the 
	next Congress will be a lame duck one that will be dominated by vetoes by 
	the president and partisan bickering. We may see Mr. Bush’s mean side. Even 
	though Mr. Bush is in a conciliatory mood as he digests the bad news from 
	this year’s mid-term election, the White House will veto any bill not to his 
	liking. This trend may continue until January 2009 when Mr. Bush's second 
	term expires. Until then stay tuned for a confrontational politics in 
	America the likes of which has never seen before in recent time.</font></p>
