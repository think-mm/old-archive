			Lest we forget, some MPs and local leaders belonging to BNP and 
			Jamaat from Bogra, Atrai, Naogaon, Rajshahi, etc., were instrumental 
			in reviving the <span style="COLOR: black">Jamaa’tul Mujahideen

			</span></font><font face="Verdana">JMB goons with blessings of BNP 
			and Jamaat high command in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>.&nbsp; The idea was to crush 
			the militant communist goons by the name “Sorbohara” in western part 
			of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> by JMB goons who created a reign of terror 
			in rural areas of that area.&nbsp; <O></O></font></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 6, 2004, I read in 
			Dhaka’s newspaper for the first time that a ‘Mullah Omar’ like 
			figure by the name Azizur Rahman aka Bangla Bhai who is dispensing 
			justice in the northwestern districts of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; 
			Later, we learnt that Bangla Bhai’s real name is Siddiqul Islam.&nbsp; In 
			the summer of 2004, I also saw a photograph that showed two bearded 
			Islamists sitting on the floor underneath a big photograph of 
			Khaleda Zia hung by the wall.&nbsp; The newspaper that printed the photo 
			identified the men as Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai, Siddiqul 
			Islam.&nbsp; A picture is worth thousand words.&nbsp; We knew the allegiance 
			of these two militants right away.<O></O></font></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp; When Bangla Bhai’s men 
			were wreaking havoc in western districts of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
			during the summer months of 2004 we also read in the newspaper that 
			some powerful ministers of Khaleda Zia were brazenly telling the 
			media that Bangla Bhai is a figment of imagination of the press.&nbsp; 
			What balderdash!&nbsp; The two Jamaati ministers, who are adorning 
			Khaleda Zia’s cabinet, also uttered some harsh words against the 
			press for publishing Bangla Bhai’s high profile activities.&nbsp; The 
			lawmakers in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1> were oblivious to what was happening 
			in western districts.&nbsp; Things went so badly that the <ST1>U.S.</ST1> 
			government and European Union became alarmed by the extra-judicial 
			killing and torture perpetrated by JMB goons.&nbsp; However, that hardly 
			ruffled feathers among BNP and Jamaat leaderships.&nbsp; In 2004, most 
			cabinet members of Khaleda Zia were tightlipped about JMB goons; 
			they openly questioned the veracity of news that was published by 
			the newspapers.&nbsp; One of them openly ridiculed the press while 
			asserting that Bangla Bhai is the creation of the media.&nbsp; <O></O>

			<font face="Verdana">During 2004 and 2005, a lot has happened 
			throughout <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> vis-à-vis political assassination 
			and incidence of grenade lobbing in opposition political rally.&nbsp; But 
			then, all hell broke loose on August 17, 2005, when more than 400 
			homemade bombs were blasted in every nook and cranny of <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1> in a coordinated fashion.&nbsp; Even though these 
			explosives were crudely made, the impact from these bombings shook 
			the foundation of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> civil society.&nbsp; Clearly, 
			Khaleda Zia’s government was in disarray in the aftermath of this 
			spate of bombings.&nbsp; The Bush Administration that had waged a 
			unilateral war against global terrorism initially did not pay much 
			attention to what was happening in the tiny land as far as jihadi 
			activities were concerned.&nbsp; After the Islamists did their blitzkrieg 
			on August 17, 2005, <ST1>Washington</ST1> was very much perturbed.&nbsp; 
			Suddenly, <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> was in the radar screen of the Bush 
			Administration.&nbsp; Some high profile visit from 
<ST1>Washington</ST1> to Dhaka had ensued because of the mega bombings allover <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; The Bush Administration took the cue from the 
			English newspapers published from <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>.&nbsp; They pointblank 
			asked Khaleda Zia to arrest the masterminds of these bombings.<O></O></font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<O></O></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></O>
			<font face="Verdana">We saw in later part of 2005 a sea change of 
			attitude in Khaleda Zia Administration.&nbsp; Before the <ST1>U.S.</ST1> 
			took a grim view of the development in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>, the 
			Khaleda Zia Administration was busily propagating the idea that a 
			foreign nation was involved in the massive bombing allover <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; To legitimize the administration’s view that a 
			foreign power was at the root of all the problem, Mrs. Khaleda Zia 
			appointed a one-Justice commission chaired by Justice Zoinul Abedin 
			who did a quick investigation of the grenade blasting incident that 
			took place on August 17, 2004 in broad daylight outside Awami 
			League’s headquarter located on Bangabandhu Avenue.&nbsp; His conclusion 
			was that local hoodlums in collaboration with a foreign country’s 
			counterintelligence had staged the bloody incident in which more 
			than two dozens people were killed including one prominent female 
			Awami leader.&nbsp; The police destroyed the key evidences by hurriedly 
			burying the dead and not protecting the crime scene.&nbsp; The FBI, 
			Scotland Yard, and Interpol came to Dhaka to investigate the 
			high-profile crime but they could not sink their teeth because of 
			the mismanagement by the <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> police.&nbsp; That however 
			did not deter our erudite Justice, Zoinul Abedin, who simply 
			rubberstamped the conclusion of Khaleda Zia Administration.<O></O></font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<O></O></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></O>
			<font face="Verdana">Most observers including this writer have been 
			saying for a long time that many of the bombings in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
			had been the handiwork of homegrown Islamists.&nbsp; However, our 
			assertions were falling into the deaf ears of Khaleda Zia 
			government.&nbsp; And there is a reason for it.&nbsp; The Islamists such as 
			members of JMB had connection to the four-part alliance government.&nbsp; 
			I will cite only one example to make my case.&nbsp; Under the pressure 
			from civil society, Khaleda Zia ordered the arrest of Bangla Bhai 
			sometime in the monsoon months in 2004.&nbsp; While this was going on, 
			the Bangla Bhai men had rallied in the streets of Rajshahi in an 
			open motorcade.&nbsp; The police super was present in the rally as the 
			JMB goons brought their panoply of colorful motorcycle, trucks, and 
			buses to streets of Rajshahi.&nbsp; The goons were given protection by 
			the law and order department of the <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
			government.&nbsp; Who did block the arrest warrant for Bangla Bhai and 
			his lieutenants in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1>?&nbsp; Obviously, Khaleda Zia and his 
			powerful ministers were behind this vile game.&nbsp; They said one thing, 
			however, did the quite opposite.<O></O></font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<O></O></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></O>
			<font face="Verdana">Why did Khaleda Zia Administration bent on 
			arresting the JMB leadership now?&nbsp; There must be a reason or two.&nbsp; 
			The next national parliamentary election is looming and Khaleda Zia 
			knows it well that there is a perception out there that her 
			administration was behind the emergence of JMB as a political 
			force.&nbsp; The second reason is the persistent pressure from <ST1>
			Washington</ST1>.&nbsp; Mr. Bush’s emissary, Assistant Secretary Rocca, 
			visited Bangladesh not too long ago and she demanded an all out 
			effort by the Bangladesh government to capture Shaikh Abdur Rahman 
			and Siddiqul Islam aka Bangla Bhai.&nbsp; When <ST1>Washington</ST1> 
			talks, Khaleda Zia listens.&nbsp; Thus, came the high profile arrest of 
			JMB chief.&nbsp; <O></O></font></p>
			<p align="justify">
			<O></O></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></O>
			<font face="Verdana">Isn’t it surprising to know from the media that 
			Shaikh Abdur Rahman and his entourage had been living in a house for 
			over a month in a densely populated city in northeastern part of <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1>?&nbsp; The government of Khaleda Zia knew the 
			whereabouts of JMB supremo all along, but her administration decided 
			not to do anything about him.&nbsp; Had she arrested the Shaikh earlier, 
			there would have been a chaos in her administration.&nbsp; The Jamaat 
			wing of her administration would have been very dissatisfied with 
			the arrest of JMB leadership.&nbsp; But now, the political equation in <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1> was recomputed and the JMB goons were left to fend 
			for themselves.&nbsp; It is a small wonder that Khaleda Zia’s right hand 
			man, Mannan Bhuiyan, the Secretary General of ruling BNP, does not 
			like the characterization of the high-profile arrest of the Shaikh 
			by the opposition.&nbsp; Many an observer in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> holds 
			the view that the arrest of Shaikh Rahman was stage-managed to 
			garner wide publicity especially in the West.&nbsp; President Bush may 
			utter some kind words as he often does whenever President Pervez 
			Musharraf tells the <ST1>U.S.</ST1> president that Pakistani 
			authorities have arrested some al-Qaeda men.&nbsp; <O></O></font></div>
		<div class="MsoNormal">
			<p align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></O>
			<font face="Verdana">The debate on whether Islamist zealots in <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1>, who are behind the widespread bombings for the 
			last 5-6 years, were being protected by Khaleda Zia’s government 
			will rage on in the media.&nbsp; However, if one does a critical 
			evaluation on the situation, the rise in Islamic fundamentalism in <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1>, one would surely find the connection between the 
			Khaleda Zia Administration and the JMB leadership.&nbsp; The way JMB 
			godfathers behaved in the western districts of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
			in the summer months of 2004, one would be hard pressed to believe 
			that the leadership of JMB knew well that they would receive 
			impunity from the government, which they did until now.&nbsp; Blame it on 
			the civil society or the Bush Administration, but the fact remains 
			the same — the Islamists are in disarray at this time.&nbsp; It is a 
			matter of time when Bangla Bhai will be arrested who is now 
			absconding.&nbsp; Don’t forget for a moment that Khaleda Zia has an 
			election to win late this year and on top of it, she needs the 
			support of the Bush Administration.&nbsp; The game of go hide and seek in <ST1>
			Bangladesh</ST1> is not done yet.&nbsp; Only time will tell the extent of 
			the nexus between the Islamists of JMB and the four-part alliance 
			government in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.</font></div>
