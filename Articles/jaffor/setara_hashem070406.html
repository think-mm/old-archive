  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on
	April 07, 2006</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Won’t you forgive me please for 
	giving this expository article a title that would imply that I am a 
	pedagogue, which I am not?&nbsp; However, please read on, and you will understand 
	why I gave the article such a weird title.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">I will be exposing here a 
	strange person whom you may call a cross-dresser who claims to have attended 
	Dacca University in the early sixties when Dhaka used to be spelled that 
	way.&nbsp; About 4-5 years ago, I first saw the name of a female person by the 
	name Setara Hashem from New York City who would post short articles to News 
	From Bangladesh (NFB).&nbsp; Those article written in non-standard English (often 
	devoid of articles and strange sentence construction) used to glorify 
	Marxism at the cost of demeaning the free market economy (read capitalism).&nbsp; 
	We did not pay much attention to it because most people inhabiting this orb 
	know by now that communism is on the way out from twenty first century.&nbsp; One 
	would be hard pressed to find communist nations on earth barring Fidel 
	Castro's Cuba and Kim Jong II's North Korea.&nbsp; Marxism these days are 
	suffering from a severe case of malnutrition and had been infirm since when 
	the Soviet imploded in the summer months of 1991.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">The ground reality however did not 
	deter Setara Hashem from penning her short articles through which “she” used 
	to lambaste the free market economy.&nbsp; This was odd because of all places in 
	the world “she” decided to live in USA - the citadel of capitalism.&nbsp; The 
	Mecca of capitalism, the Wall Street, is located miles away from Setara’s 
	home but still then “she” went on to saying demeaning things about the free 
	market economy.&nbsp; Thus, many sensible people in the Net were sick and tired 
	of reading the junk she would post in various forums.&nbsp; When I found out that 
	the information on which “she” was basing her thesis were all wrong, only 
	then did I protest in the pages of NFB and Vinnomot.&nbsp; That nonetheless 
	brought a deluge of condemnation from Setara.&nbsp; One veteran writer, Mr. 
	Mahfuzur Rahman from New York, once suggested Setara not to butcher 
	Shakespeare's mother tongue.&nbsp; The article was written in humorous tone but 
	Setara did not get to see the lighter side of the article; Mr. Rahman was 
	vilified rather mercilessly.&nbsp; After this incident, Setara Hashem became very 
	belligerent and unfortunately resorted to name-calling in every possible way 
	whom would agree to disagree with “her” pet by weak thesis.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">In 2003, Setara started to pen her 
	articles in Bangla along with many Bangalees.&nbsp; The deshi forums such as 
	Mukto-Mona, Vinnomot, Shodalap, etc., became more colorful and vibrant.&nbsp; And 
	Miss Hashem writings in the Net took a colorful turn.&nbsp; Now she was able to 
	throw epithets in Bangla.&nbsp; What an epiphany!&nbsp; Many Bangalee writers in the 
	Net were bestowed with colorful names.&nbsp; I was named &quot;Bongo- Chelabi&quot; even 
	though I wrote quite a few articles against George Bush's adventurism in the 
	Middle East.&nbsp; Vinnomot's editor, Quddus Khan, used to be Setara’s most 
	favorite punching bag.&nbsp; I requested many a time to her through my writing to 
	stop to this practice of name-calling but she hardly cared or listened.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">By 2004, it was very clear that a 
	man was using a female name to abuse other Bangalee writers.&nbsp; This person’s 
	attack was become very bold and brazen.&nbsp; The language was becoming foul 
	too.&nbsp; One time in 2002 or 2003 (I forgot now the exact year) this person 
	while rebutting my article used some anatomical terms from human’s lower 
	extremity.&nbsp; I then figured that this person is no female because a woman 
	won’t use those terms in public.&nbsp; Then I started to look closely for the 
	choice of words and diction in Setara’s writing and what I saw was not an 
	ounce of femininity.&nbsp; It was very clear that the person was masquerading as 
	a female in the cyberspace.&nbsp; As any Netter would agree with me, it is very 
	easy to throw mud in the Internet under an assumed name.&nbsp; This person was 
	just doing that day-in-day-out.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">This person used to mention in his 
	article that she attended Dacca University studying sociology.&nbsp; It befitted 
	“her” because “she” used to write on topics covering the field of social 
	anthropology, human society, etc.&nbsp; But then, later “she” started to write on 
	the perils of free market economy, Marxism, and other topics.&nbsp; Setara 
	mentioned in an article that she had a degree in science and tech area.&nbsp; I 
	was confounded reading this.&nbsp; “She” was like a multi-headed hydra assuming 
	myriad personality.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Many readers in Mukto-Mona forum 
	were confounded when “she” would vigorously defend the divinity of Muhammad, 
	Koran, and Islam.&nbsp; In fact, if someone would critique Islam, Setara would 
	say contradictory thing such as all religions including Islam is manmade but 
	somehow Muhammad’s religion is somewhat more divine than other preexisting 
	religions.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">By now many forum-goers would know 
	that Darwinism is a favorite topic among freethinkers in Mukto-Mona forum.&nbsp; 
	Many of us would pen essay to mark the Darwin Day in this forum.&nbsp; Setara 
	would remain reticent when Darwin Day is celebrated in early February 2006.&nbsp; 
	However, one time “she” vigorously protested against my write-up on Charles 
	Darwin asking me do I know what is “Social Darwinism,” which was “her” pet 
	topic?&nbsp; I vigorously protested that that field was not discussed anymore in 
	academia because it is a defunct concept.&nbsp; After two years she has changed 
	her mind and I found it that “she” no longer believes in such a bogus 
	subject as ‘Social Darwinism.’&nbsp; Many of us had observed that “her” knowledge 
	in myriad worldly subject is superficial, feeble, and limited to propaganda 
	material printed in Kolkata by the Soviet in the heydays of Brezhnev era in 
	the1960s and 1960s.&nbsp; In fact, her writings remind many of us those booklets, 
	which are lovingly called “<i>Choti Boi</i>” in Bangla.&nbsp; Readers in the Net 
	by now had heard an earful of glowing encomiums to Marxism from Setara.&nbsp; The 
	concept of Dialectical Materialism was defined and redefined up to umpteenth 
	times by “her” but the way “she’ acts even today Setara thinks “she” is 
	hardly done with it.&nbsp; At every opportunity that lands before “her” Setara 
	lambastes the capitalist society while devouring the nectar of capitalism 
	sitting cozily in the Big Apple.&nbsp; How ironical it could get?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Lately, Setara’s ire had fall on 
	two netters, namely, <b>Mr. Mehul Kamdar</b> and <b>Dr. Biplab Pal</b>.&nbsp; 
	While Mr. Kamdar had joined M-M forum as one of the moderators, Dr. Pal is 
	now devoting his time with Vinnomot after maturing in M-M forum throughout 
	2005.&nbsp; Another person who is routinely abused by Setara is <b>Avijit Roy</b>, 
	the founding moderator of Mukto-Mona forum.&nbsp; Setara through “her” infinite 
	“wisdom” thinks the secularists in M-M forum are just the same as 
	fundamentalist Muslims.&nbsp; “She” considers these two competing ideas as coin’s 
	two sides.&nbsp; This is a weird concept of “her”; it was derived from 
	dialectics, which Setara is so enamored with.&nbsp; This person sees everything 
	in the light of dialectics.&nbsp; I tried to point out many a time that there is 
	such a thing call gray scale going from black to white.&nbsp; The world we live 
	in has many things that won’t fall within the domain of dialectics.&nbsp; That is 
	the reason many philosophers had pooh-poohed dialectics in late eighteenth 
	and early twentieth century.&nbsp; Idealism came out as a philosophical term to 
	denounce dialectics and Marxism.&nbsp; Human endeavors such as music, sculpture, 
	dance, arts, etc., developed because of the force inherent to idealism.&nbsp; Our 
	society made progress in myriad fields such as medicine, industry, 
	education, technology, etc., because of a few visionaries.&nbsp; Marxism or 
	dialectics had no role in it.&nbsp; In fact, Karl Marx’s ideas of human society 
	were confined to late nineteenth century when the world was ushering in a 
	new wave of industrialization.&nbsp; Marx correctly saw the evils in rampant 
	industrialization as it relates to exploitation of labor.&nbsp; However, the 
	labor movement in the West took the corrective measure to protect the 
	interest of labor.&nbsp; We tried hopelessly to tell Setara all this but it fell 
	into “her” deaf ear.&nbsp; Setara was already brainwashed by the Soviet 
	propaganda literature in the 1960s.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">In recent days, Setara’s attack on 
	Avijit Roy grew by leaps and bounds.&nbsp; In one recent post Setara laments by 
	saying that it confounds her to know that <b>both M-M and Vinnomot had 
	appointed two Dogs from India</b>.&nbsp; Such epithetical remarks go to show how 
	much hate Setara has on Indians.&nbsp; I have already alluded to this in my 
	previous write-up that many Dhaka University graduates of the 1950s and 
	1960s were brainwashed by their professors to hate India.&nbsp; It hardly 
	surprises me to know that these graduates were victims of brainwashing by 
	their pedagogues.&nbsp; As per the two-nation theory of M. A. Jinnah, Pakistanis 
	should abhor India by all means.&nbsp; Setara and many other DU graduates became 
	a lost cause as far as building amity among Indians and Bangladeshis.&nbsp; To 
	these folks India is a six hundred pound gorilla about to devour Bangladesh 
	in a moment’s notice.&nbsp; I have seen many delusional people in Bangladesh who 
	harbor this kind of fear and they will say out loud how much hate they have 
	in their heart for India.&nbsp; Well, enough on Setara'’ confounding and 
	delusional mental state!&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">How did we learn the true identity 
	of Setara Hashem?&nbsp; Is there a real Setara Hashem living in any of the five 
	burroughs of New York?&nbsp; Please visit many of the social gatherings in the 
	Big Apple and ask this question – “Would the real Setara Hashem please stand 
	up?”&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; You would come out empty handed.&nbsp; I came to up state New 
	York in late September in 2005 because of the destruction of my homes in the 
	Gulf Coast of America.&nbsp; My employer put me in Cornell campus where there is 
	a USDA research facility but once it was known that I am in Ithaca, a 
	professor approached the Dean of CALS and I was invited to join the 
	department of Animal Science, which I did.&nbsp; After settling in Ithaca my 
	contact with New Yorkers grew exponentially and asked them do they know whom 
	Setara Hashem is.&nbsp; They simply shrugged their shoulder.&nbsp; No one has seen 
	this outstanding woman from NYC who single-handedly had strewn the 
	cyberspace with expired and outdated concepts.&nbsp; But then the lucky break 
	came in.&nbsp; The truth has a peculiar way of emerging out!&nbsp; One <b>Mr. A.H. 
	Mohiuddin</b> may have bragged among a closely knitted circle of friends 
	that he pens using this moniker in various forums in the Internet to 
	lambaste the secularists from Sonar Bangla.&nbsp; That is not all, he also 
	submits article in Bangla newspapers published in the NYC area to propagate 
	his hate for freethinkers.&nbsp; Well, I would not reveal the name of the person 
	who decoded the “da Vinci” code to <b>let us know the true identity of Mr. 
	Mohiuddin, however, suffice it to say that the mystery behind Setara is 
	over.</b>&nbsp; Please take it from me — there is no Setara Hashem in NYC.&nbsp; Not 
	even the ghost of Setara.&nbsp; Zilch!&nbsp; The name just came from a thin ear and 
	concocted by this conniving man who is well into his sixties.&nbsp; I have no 
	idea what Mr. Mohiuddin does to eke out a living in NYC but it will come now 
	because Setara Hashem's identity is known now.&nbsp; What drove him to behave 
	like this in the net?&nbsp; Maybe, his loved one may shed light on this.&nbsp; He most 
	certainly had hated other successful Bangalees who could pen meaningful 
	articles.&nbsp; A case of inferiority complex! Who knows? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b>Why did Mr. Mohiuddin take up a 
	female name to confuse us all?&nbsp; His friends should ask him this simple 
	question.&nbsp;</b> <b>Did he want to draw sympathy?&nbsp; Or, is it that no one would 
	go after a female participant in a discussion forum?</b>&nbsp; I have no easy 
	answer.&nbsp; Well, I hope this would be the end of Setara Hashem but if I may 
	guess there will be a reincarnation of Mr. A.H. Mohiuddin. Therefore, clean 
	your reading glass or better yet, get a powerful magnifying glass because a 
	new moniker would show up in the cyber space.&nbsp; The face will be new but the 
	message will be the stale one – long live Setara Hashem's version of Marxism 
	and socialism and to hell with capitalism.&nbsp; And that is for sure.</font></p>
