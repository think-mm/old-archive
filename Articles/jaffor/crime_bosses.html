	<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana">We all thought that finally 
	the days of political criminals are numbered when the army in <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1> started to arrest a few crime bosses, criminals with 
	political affiliation, etc.&nbsp; A year ago a list circulated in the Internet 
	that showed how much money was siphoned off from public fund in <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1> in the last 5 years and by whom.&nbsp; Needless to say, the bulk 
	of the money stolen from public fund was connected to Khaleda Zia’s party 
	and a sizable amount was stolen by her own family members including her 
	good-for-nothing son, Tarek Rahman.&nbsp; The newspapers in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
	also ran stories about how the friends and inner circle of Khaleda Zia’s son 
	became multimillionaire overnight.&nbsp; One name that was mentioned is that of 
	Mr. Giasuddin Mamun, who is the sidekick of Khaleda Zia’s eldest son.&nbsp; 
	Therefore, when the news came just in the aftermath of emergency declaration 
	in 
<ST1>Dhaka</ST1> that Mr. Mamun was arrested by the army, we all thought it was 
	the right beginning.&nbsp; However, today (January 15, 2007) I read that the High 
	Court of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> has asked the army and police not to trouble 
	Mr. Mamun any further.<br>
	<br>
	I urge Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the newly appointed Chief Advisor of the 
	caretaker government, to give orders to law and order department to 
	apprehend all the criminals who are connected with the major political 
	parties.&nbsp; The police should not go after petit criminals who steal only 
	nickel and dime.&nbsp; Instead, the army and police should round up all the 
	criminals with political patronage.&nbsp; I read that most ministers who served 
	Khaleda Zia from October 2001 through October 2006 have become filthy rich.&nbsp; 
	Should not the government ask them to provide evidence how they amassed such 
	phenomenal wealth in just 5 years sans Aladdin’s magic lamp.<br>
	<br>
	Let us hope that the CG in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1> will not go slow to apprehend 
	all these criminals.&nbsp; Secondly, the corrupt ex-MPs and godfathers should not 
	be allowed to run for parliamentary election.&nbsp; I have no sympathy for H.M. 
	Ershad.&nbsp; If the EC barred him from competing in the next election, then 
	other politicians who were identified having links to crime and whose net 
	worth had become astronomical should also be barred.&nbsp; If required these 
	corrupt individuals should be railroaded to receive a speedy trial.&nbsp; The 
	bigger question is – will this happen now during the emergency?&nbsp; The experts 
	are indicating that the new CG will be in office for at least 90 days.&nbsp; 
	Therefore, if they have the resolve, all the criminals could be rounded up 
	in a cinch.&nbsp; The police precisely know who they are.&nbsp; Therefore, 
	apprehending them won’t be a monumental task.<br>
	<br>
	I am a bit surprised knowing that not many cyber forums are vocal about this 
	endemic problem that afflicts <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; If the nation cannot 
	rid of the mega-criminals with high political patronage, these thugs will 
	re-enter the politics and the cycle of crime will start in pronto 
	immediately after the parliamentary election.&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	The emergency declaration in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> was not greeted with an 
	open arm by people who prefer democracy over oligarchy (a government by a 
	few influential people) but these select few people who are at the helm may 
	do something which will not be possible by any democratically elected 
	government in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.&nbsp; Thus a fantastic opportunity is 
	literally knocking at the door.&nbsp; What are we waiting for? <br>
	<br>
	Maybe, I am expecting way too much from the caretaker government whose 
	mandate is only to prepare the nation for an honest, fair, and unbiased 
	election.&nbsp; Thus, I am disheartened but not appalled to hear the news today 
	that the HC in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> is asking the law and order department 
	not to harass Giasuddin Mamun who made billions in the last 5 years.&nbsp; All of 
	this could change if the President makes a decree that the nation is now 
	under an emergency rule; therefore, civil rights protected by the 
	constitution may not apply now. <br>
	<br>
	The people of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> will remember for a long time and they 
	would go out of their way to thank Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed and his council of 
	advisors if his caretaker administration could rid the society of crime 
	bosses with political connection.&nbsp; It is doable and must be done.&nbsp; This 
	temporary government could write a history and set an example of good 
	governance, which will go down in the annals of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
	history as a turning point.&nbsp; Why not go for it? </font></p>
