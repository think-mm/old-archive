	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This hardly a retrospective writing. 
	A month or so ago before hurricane Katrina struck Southeast Louisiana 
	coastline if someone would have told me that I will be back into a campus, I 
	would have jeered at him or her. But look? Where am I now? A week ago on 
	September 24, 2005, I came to Ithaca, New York - a college town that is 240 
	or so miles northwest of New York City to start a new life.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Katrina hit hard the Crescent City -- the nickname of New Orleans -- so much 
	so that the research center where I worked continuously for 20 years was 
	taken out of commission. The center that provided livelihood to 250 
	scientists, associate-scientists, technicians, etc., is now an empty 
	building ready to be renovated. A 10-15 feet wall of water got inside the 
	building thus damaging the ground floor. All the staff were relocated to 
	various parts of the U.S. Four of us who worked in a project to design an 
	enzyme to cut down phosphate pollution resulting from poultry and swine 
	farms were transferred to the U.S. Plant, Soil, and Nutrition laboratory 
	located inside the Cornell University. We have the slightest clue how long 
	we will stay here in Ithaca. It may be as short as 6-12 months or it may 
	linger over a year. I came to Ithaca with an open mind. Life after Katrina 
	had been very unpredictable for all of us - the victims. The itinerant life 
	that was started in the aftermath of Katrina continued for about three weeks 
	for me. That had to stop.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	I flew from Atlanta to Syracuse, an airline hub in the upstate New York. I 
	rented a car at Syracuse airport and drove about 60-70 miles in the 
	southwest direction to reach Ithaca after crossing many a small town in this 
	mountainous region, which grows apple, plum, and of course grapes that brew 
	in the winery to produce upstate wine for dinner table.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	This part of New York state is extremely hilly. The hillside is still 
	verdant, no sign of fall color discernible to naked eyes as of now, but one 
	could sense that before long the foliage of myriad kinds of deciduous trees 
	and shrubs would change color to prepare for months of wintry days and 
	nights. While New Orleans area is still hot and muggy at this time, Ithaca 
	and surrounding place, which is about 1200-1300 miles to the northeast of 
	coastal Louisiana, is having a typical fall weather; 60-65 degrees 
	Fahrenheit in the daytime while plunging to a crisp 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit 
	in the night. I came here without any fall or winter clothes, which was a 
	big mistake on my part. In New Orleans, one could survive without any winter 
	clothes because of the mild semi-tropical climate they have down there. But 
	upstate New York is a different place where winter here could be very 
	brutal. I remedied my clothing situation by becoming an ardent shopper. 
	Bought some fall and winter clothes. I saw a guy in a departmental store 
	meticulously looking at some winter boots. Carrying a pair of suede shoe I 
	approached him and asked, “Do you think I can make it out here in winter 
	months with this shoe?” He replied with a wry face, “Not a chance!” I saw 
	that the boot he was examining had more insulation and had a sturdy 
	construction. “This would get you going in December-January,” the man told 
	me with a smiling face. Although the boot weighs a ton, I reluctantly bought 
	it. The last thing I want to see is a pair of partially frozen leg after 
	walking over snow-laden road and fields at Cornell University. I am getting 
	ready now to brave the harsh winter of upstate New York.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The Cornell University is not exactly an unknown place to me. In the 1980s 
	when I was a research associate at the laboratory of Professor I.C. Gunsalus, 
	in University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, I heard some interesting 
	stories about life in Cornell from my mentor who did his bachelor, master, 
	and doctoral degrees at Cornell in late 1930s. Later in early 1990s, I met a 
	female post-doctoral fellow in my research institute in New Orleans who 
	worked for few months in my laboratory was also a Cornell alumni. Everyone 
	who visited Cornell say that it is one of the prettiest campuses in the U.S. 
	This is not an understatement. Ithaca is a small town with about 30,000 
	people (excluding 20 thousand students in two colleges) housed in about 
	40-50 square miles. Both the Cornell and Ithaca College are located in two 
	neighboring hills. To be in the campus of these two colleges, one has climb 
	hills. Not many people literally climbs the hills. I did not see any biker 
	doing that. Students, faculty members, and staff either ride the city and 
	county buses or drive cars. Ithaca, located inside Tompkins County, is a hub 
	for TCAT (Tompkins County Area Transport) buses that crisscross the town and 
	the outlying areas. With a Cornell student, faculty, and staff card, one 
	could ride these buses free. I surely will take advantage of this facility 
	in the winter when roads in Ithaca become treacherous because of excessive 
	snowfalls. Inadvertently, I rented a house 1.25 mile to the east of the 
	campus. Therefore, if I wanted to go back-and forth from my house to my 
	place of work, I could do so by riding route 50 buses. The university, which 
	is home to many diehard liberals and conservationists, promotes mass transit 
	system. Talking about liberals, the other day I saw a car bumper sticker 
	that read “Do not elect Bush in 2004). In the winter days with steep snow 
	covered roads to climb, many a Cornelian rides buses to avoid hazardous 
	driving. You won’t find such a nice arrangement in other campuses. Come to 
	think of it, the buses in Urbana-Champaign cost money and routes are not 
	extensive as it is in Ithaca.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	To start a new life here in the campus I needed various identity cards. It 
	took me about 2 hours to walk from one building to another to obtain 
	Cornell’s picture id, library card, Net id card (that allows one to use the 
	Internet and receive e-mail), and a bus pass. Parking car is very tight in 
	the crammed campus; therefore, only option that I had was to walk across the 
	campus. Most buildings that I had to go falls on Tower Road; thus, I thought 
	I would saunter taking my time. But how wrong was I. Thousands of students 
	came out from their classes; it was lunch time. I had to walk faster than my 
	usual speed to make sure that I was not causing any traffic jam on sidewalk. 
	Suddenly, I thought I became a grad student all over again!. In my youth, in 
	the 1970s, I have done this routine for five years. Crisscrossing the 
	Cornell campus thus brought back a lot of memory in me. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	I have always envied college professors for one reason. They always teach 
	students whose age range from 18 through 28. Since I worked in New Orleans 
	in a research lab for over twenty-years, I almost forgot the charm of a 
	campus life. Yesterday, as I cut across the campus, I saw so many young 
	students. White Americans, Chinese, Indians, and few American minorities. 
	Since Cornell is a proud member of Ivy League schools, the tuition is a 
	steep one. It therefore makes sense as to why it is a predominantly a white 
	school. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Fall brings fashion to the campus, undoubtedly. Male students mostly wore 
	long-sleeved shirts and slacks, but coeds wore mostly low-rider jeans. The 
	college campuses are microcosm of American culture; thus, I am not all that 
	surprised to see the girls wearing trendy clothes. Personally, I would not 
	rather see women wearing low- rider jeans. Clothes are supposed to cover 
	human body. These new fashion jeans do quite the opposite. We shall have to 
	see how long this fad of low-rider jeans would last. In the 1970s, there was 
	a craze about bell-bottom jeans. We all used to wear them “religiously” 
	while thinking it was a cool thing to don ourselves with bell-bottom jeans. 
	Now we know better! Fashion is made and marketed by big corporations who are 
	into clothing business. Low rider jeans for women are a big business these 
	days. Not only the teens and college coeds are buying them, some middle-aged 
	women are also wearing them but some of them look horrible due to excess fat 
	both in midriff area and waistline. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The fall season also brings two other things to tree-studded campuses in 
	America - cold temperature and fall color. The deciduous trees’ leaves would 
	go through chemical changes before falling to the ground. Because of these 
	changes the leaf color would change from green various shades of yellow and 
	red. Sometimes the fall color would come a bit early in the last week of 
	September. This year, however, leaves are showing a but resistance to change 
	color. If one looks carefully, one could see that terminal leaves are 
	turning color. Within 2 weeks from now, the changing color of the foliages 
	would dazzle us. Then the leaves would fall on the ground to give the trees 
	an austere look. For the next six months (from November through April) the 
	trees would go into a dormant phase. In spring, leaf bud would sprout to 
	break the dormancy and the trees would come to life displaying their usual 
	verdant demeanor.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	As I have mentioned before, I came to America as a grad student in the fall 
	of 1969. After 36 long years I am again crisscrossing roads in a campus 
	town. It is a throwback for me. The campus life, which I was so accustomed 
	to and which I almost forgot, is coming back to me. Again, I felt like a 
	grad student in Cornell campus. It seems as if this campus town is going to 
	be my home for a year so. I am determined to make the best use of it.<br>
