	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lately, NFB has become a waterhole 
	for dunces. With sadness I say this. This used to be a thriving cyberspace 
	with myriad-minded folks imbued with modernity. However, as of late, many 
	obscurantist writers have been clogging the cyberspace with their fib. Read 
	on and you will know what am I writing about. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not a single issue of NFB that goes 
	by these days without having some propaganda material blaring from the front 
	page. For the last few months a charlatan Bangalee by the name Mohammad 
	Zainal Abedin had been posting his scribble in this news forum. He claims to 
	be a researcher but he fails to tell the reader in which area he does his 
	research. What is his academic credential and training to do research? He 
	also claims to be a journalist. In which newspapers does he write? I 
	routinely go through Dhaka’s English news dailies but never before did I 
	peruse any article written by this “journalist.” If however he only writes 
	for Inquilab or Sangram, then it is a different story. Since he is the one 
	who is claiming all the outrageous stuff and NFB editor does not see that 
	Abedin’s claims fall into the category of Yellow Journalism, the onus is on 
	the writer and NFB editor to tell the readerships who this Mohammad Zainal 
	Abedin is. After all, all these allegations about RAW doing bombings is 
	coming from him. In the same vein, he refutes the existence of Bangla Bhai 
	and JMB. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have seen a sea change in attitude 
	among decent Bangladeshis who used to patently hate Sheikh Mujib and Awami 
	League for whatever reasons. But these folks are coming around. Many readers 
	may know that I have been writing about the growing menace of Islamization 
	since 1997 when NFB came into the fore in cyber space. In fact, in 1998, I 
	floated a web site by the name “Is Islamization of Bangladesh complete” in 
	MSN. Many Bangalees were upset by my write-ups but I never swayed from the 
	truth. I could see the danger clearly coming from the growth of Islamic 
	fundamentalism in my ancestral homeland. A case in point is Dristipat’s 
	managing director, Mr. Asif Saleh. He hated my write-ups so much that he 
	used to pen short postings with derogatory remarks. He thought my assertion 
	about BNP codling Jamaat and other fundamentalists were figment of 
	imagination. It took Mr. Asif Saleh quite a few years before realizing that 
	I was telling the truth all along. It is heartening to read an editorial 
	written by him Daily Star on December 5, 2005, entitled “How did we get 
	here.” The article is synonymous to the old Bangla phrase “Bhooter Mukhey 
	Ram Naam.” But Mr. Asif Saleh had the epiphany at long last. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I knew that the likes of Asif Saleh 
	who loved the party BNP would one-day see the light of the day. The day of 
	reckoning is right now. But to change some diehard Islamists such as 
	Mohiuddin Anwar or Mohammad Zainal Abedin is another matter. These folks 
	will always smell rat in India. Their favorite view is – “India the 
	proverbial six hundred pounds gorilla is out there to devour our Sonar 
	Bangladesh.” They hardly know the fact that annexation of a country with 145 
	million people under this “New World Order” is unthinkable. It won’t sit 
	well with the world community. Nonetheless, they will act like the 
	proverbial Chicken Little who thought the sky is falling. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Mohammad Zainal Abedin is our 
	Chicken Little who wrongly assumes that India is about to gobble up 
	Bangladesh. He is not alone in this bizarre mode of thinking. Barrister 
	Munshi, historian Tajul Islam Hashmi, rocker cum jazz musician Maqsood, 
	ex-VC of Bangladesh Emajuddin, columnist Sadek Khan, and a whole slues of 
	Bangladeshi thinkers, writers, newspapermen also hold such view. They think 
	everything that ails Bangladesh is the handiwork of India and its agencies 
	such as RAW, BSF, Army, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our “erudite” pundit, Mohammad 
	Zainal Abedin, is now busily propagating the false notion that there is no 
	such entity call JMB or Bangla Bhai in Bangladesh. He falsely argues that 
	Islamic extremists are the figment of imagination by the India-loving press 
	of Bangladesh. He also thinks that India has this great plan to prove to the 
	world that Bangladesh is a “failed state.” In the end, he argues, India 
	wanted to annex Bangladesh. But little do these charlatan writers understand 
	the ground reality in South Asia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh has become an outright 
	dangerous place on earth. Blame it on Huzurs, Muftis, Pirs, Mullahs, 
	Shaikhul Hadis, Alems, Deobandis, Tabligis, and the entire shebang of 
	Bangladesh’s religious world. These people are the ones who had been 
	preaching ad infinitum since August 1975 to make this deltaic land into an 
	Islamic Utopia. Not a day is wasted to preach and brain wash the young 
	minds. Therefore, there is this proliferation of Qaumi madrassahs where they 
	“teach” spiritual matters to convert the otherwise beautiful minds into 
	hate-laden venomous one. In essence, these so-called Qaumi madrassahs have 
	become snake farms. Mark my word, Mr. Zainal Abedin and Golam Arshad (aka 
	Mohiuddin Anwar). Shying away from the reality won’t help the ailing 
	Bangladesh. Your propaganda to falsely accuse the PM of India to hatch a 
	plan to destabilize Bangladesh is utterly deplorable. Do you care to know 
	that in the summer months in 2004 Bangla Bhai and his marauding men were 
	parading the streets of Rajshahi under the protection of police DIG, SP, OC, 
	and ordinary sepoys? When the newsmen reported in various papers the 
	government remained silent for a long time. A week later after the police 
	let go Bangla Bhai and his men, they said – “There is no Bangla Bhai and he 
	could not be found anywhere.” Now we read in the newspaper that some BNP 
	lawmakers aided Bangla Bhai and his men to unleash a reign of terrors in 
	Rajshahi, Bogra, Atrai, Naoga, Shantahar, and in the vicinity. Well, such is 
	the reality in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Islamic politicians were also 
	vocal about Bangla Bhai but in a strange manner. They said in unison –“There 
	is no Bangla Bhai. It was created by the journalists.” These fibbers would 
	let you believe that Islamic extremism hardly exists in Sonar Islamic 
	Bangladesh. After all, Islam is a religion of Peace! What about the killing 
	of the Jews in Medina after our peaceful prophet won the victory in war. But 
	no, these are Jewish propaganda; Mohammad Zainal Abedin would foam through 
	his mouth proclaiming these inanities. No Huzurs or Muftis are going to 
	admit it lest the truth comes out in a cinch. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now that the ordinary Bangalees of 
	our motherland had realized where the snakes are coming from to bite our 
	people, they are very vocal now. To combat this growing trend the Jamaatis 
	and other shadowy Islamic groups have hired the likes of Mohammad Zainal 
	Abedin, Golam Arshad (aka Mohiuddin Anwar) to propagate the cyber space with 
	their make belief stories. These stories have no meat so to speak. Without 
	any proper attribution the charlatan scribblers are having a field day in 
	NFB. No decent newspaper would publish the fibs created by the 
	“researchers.” NFB is ruining its reputation by giving coverage to the 
	fibbers’ story. In the end, the bulk of the readership would reject these 
	insinuating write-ups. Posting these fake stories would be counterproductive 
	but the editor of NFB hardly sees the reality. Like Abedin and Anwar, he 
	probably also believe in the cock-and-bull stories that all the arrested 
	Islamists and the suicide bombers are Indian lovers who are coming by droves 
	to Bangladesh to detonate bombs and in the process dismembering their bodies 
	and spilling blood so that Bangladesh becomes in the eyes of the world body 
	— a failed state. They wrongly think that Bangladesh would be annexed by 
	India to make one “Akhanda Ram Rajya,” the dream of Hindu fundamentalist. 
	But are they in the catbird seat of power? Hell, no! The secularists are in 
	power in New Delhi, aren’t they, Mr. Mohammad Zainal Abedin? Besides, why 
	should they annex a nation that is plagued with corruption, nepotism, and 
	extremism? India is smart enough to know that by taking Bangladesh under its 
	fold, they will be inviting trouble. In fact, Bangladesh is a Pandora’s box 
	that should never be opened. Sixty thousand snake farms is no joke either, 
	Mr. Abedin? Get lost in obscurity. Bangladesh will face modernity without 
	the obscurantist like you. Why is the editor of NFB siding with the dark 
	force – I don’t get it!</font></p>
