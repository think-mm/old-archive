  not lament excessively the death of retired army General Amir Abdullah Khan
  Niazi. The English Bard, Shakespeare, wrote: “Moderate lamentation is the
  right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

  one of the masterminds of Bangladesh Genocide had died in Lahore, Pakistan of
  diabetic complications.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">To
  wash off his sin, Gen. Niazi wrote a memoir entitled “</span>Betrayal of

  1998.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ISBN: 0185777271] in which
  he blamed the whole shebang of Rawalpindi Generals for the political trouble
  in erstwhile East Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
  correctly pointed out that the political crisis brought on by Z.A. Bhutto had
  to be solved by military might of Pakistani army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Nonetheless, the memoir engendered a furious debate about Niazi’s
  role in dismemberment of Jinnah’s Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The memoir was published 3 years before the leakage of Hamoodur Rahman

  </span>One by one, Pakistan’s vile military leaders who wittingly
  participated in genocide during Bangalees 1971 freedom struggle had passed
  from this mortal world.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  General of Pakistan, General Tikka Khan, who terrorized Bangalee civilians in
  occupied Bangladesh, also had departed from this world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The one who is still surviving to our knowledge is retired major
  General Rao Farman Ali Khan, the head of the then Pakistani military
  intelligence in Dhaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh’s
  Jamaat-i-Islam leaders who are now partner in Khaleda Zia government should
  have no qualms recognizing these rogue army leaders who were ably assisted by
  them to carry out killings of the intellectuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One of the Jamaati executioners, M. Ashrafuzzaman Khan, now lives in
  the borough of Queens in New York City doing a thriving business as tour
  guides to Hajj performers from America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  reason I am bringing the nasty episode of Jamaat’s involvement with
  marauding Pakistani military while remembering Gen. Abdullah “Tiger”
  Niazi’s misdeeds is the following: Niazi’s men were able to kill quite a
  few Bangalee intellectuals in the fag end of the war for independence in
  December 1971 because of the involvement of the likes of Ashrafuzzaman Khan,
  Delwar Hossain Saidee, Prof. Golam Azam, Motiur Rahman Nizami, Maulana Ali H.M.
  Mujahid, Maulana Mannan of daily Inquilab, and few more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some of these men have now become legislators in Bangladesh and are now
  serving as cabinet ministers under Khaleda Zia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Gen. Tikka Khan, Gen. Yahya Khan, Gen. Abdullah Niazi, and Mr.
  Zulfiquar Ali Bhutto must be rolling in their graves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Such is the irony of life.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font><font size="3">General
  Niazi will live forever in infamy for the picture in which he was shown
  signing a document of surrender on December 16, 1971 in Ramna Green while
  seating next to a turban-clad Indian General by the name Jagjit Singh Aurora.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>That infamous picture had graced the front page of newspapers all over
  the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The same picture was
  shown in many network news in America and Europe too.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It brought shame to Pakistanis because General Niazi and his
  ninety thousand men in uniform were taken prisoner of war (POW) by the Indian
  army and interned in India for months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Niazi
  became an instant escape goat and characterized being a coward by Pakistani
  military in post-war days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
  the interned Pakistani soldiers were handed over to Z.A. Bhutto’s
  government, Niazi was arrested immediately and he languished in jail without a
  trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither Niazi nor
  Pakistani military leadership had shown any remorse for their wrongdoings in
  the dark days of 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Years
  later, Niazi wrote his experiences in occupied Bangladesh as his army
  participated in gratuitous mass killing, which contradicts with many scholarly
  writings on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
  memoir, Niazi essentially blamed Pakistani Generals such as Gen. Yahya Khan,
  the military president of Pakistan and General Hamid Khan, the military chief
  of Pakistan for fall of Dhaka on December 16, 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But his description of war atrocities pales to what others had written
  on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A case in point
  is the writings of Mr. R.J. Rummel, a well-recognized expert of genocide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Here is just an excerpt from Mr. Rummel’s book “Death by
  Government”:</font></span></p>

  human death toll over only 267 days was incredible. Just to give for five out
  of the eighteen districts some incomplete statistics published in Bangladesh
  newspapers or by an Inquiry Committee, the Pakistani army killed 100,000
  Bengalis in Dacca, 150,000 in Khulna, 75,000 in Jessore, 95,000 in Comilla,
  and 100,000 in Chittagong. For eighteen districts the total is 1,247,000
  killed. This was an incomplete toll, and to this day no one really knows the
  final toll. Some estimates of the democide [Rummel's &quot;death by
  government&quot;] are much lower -- one is of 300,000 dead -- but most range
  from 1 million to 3 million. ...<span style="mso-spacerun:

  about one out of every sixty-one people in Pakistan overall; one out of every
  twenty-five Bengalis, Hindus, and others in East Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If the rate of killing for all of Pakistan is annualized over the years
  the Yahya martial law regime was in power (March 1969 to December 1971), then
  this one regime was more lethal than that of the Soviet Union, China under the
  communists, or Japan under the military (even through World War II).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  and administrator in Dhaka in the waning days Pakistani rule in 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Niazi in his memoir wrote that he was very optimistic about both the
  Nixon Administration and Mao Tse-tung regime bailing out Pakistani soldiers
  trapped in the quagmire of erstwhile East Pakistan in early December 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But since no help came from world super power, he had to surrender to
  Pakistan’s archenemy, India.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pakistan’s
  military establishment never did forgive him for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He was immediately labeled as coward and whatnot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>His retirement fund was frozen and Pakistani government mistreated him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Niazi saw with his own eyes that while Gen. Tikka Khan’s
  post-military career flourished as the General was appointed as the governor
  of Punjab, he career just withered in the vine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This bitterness led Niazi to write his memoir in which he blamed every
  living army Generals of Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
  Pakistanis had opined at the time that it would have been better for Niazi and
  his men to fight Bangalee freedom fighter, <i>Mukti Bahini</i>, and Indian
  army rather than to surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>General
  Niazi had to live with shame for 33 long years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>His countrymen never did understand the difficulty his men were in as
  they fought a very unpopular war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The

  they will not ask for apology from Bangladeshi folks for the crime, which is
  so well documented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From time to

  in the waning days of 1971 shared the ignominy until his passing away from
