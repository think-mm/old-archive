  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	When Alexander the Great told his General, Seleucus, that what a strange 
	land India was, he was standing somewhere in Punjab or Northwest Frontier 
	province (NWFP). In the second week of February 2005, I read several stories 
	in the Internet about disbursement of large sum of money to several tribal 
	chiefs in South Waziristan by Pakistani government. After reading the news, 
	I also felt the same way. Indeed, Balochistan where Waziristan is located is 
	a strange place. After reading this commentary I am confident that many 
	readers would concur with me that the tribal land, which is located 
	northeast of Balochistan and southwest of NWFP, is a bit strange place.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In 2004, under pressure from Bush Administration General Musharraf ordered 
	his army to comb South Waziristan for al-Qaeda leaders and soldiers who were 
	in hiding in that mountainous region of Pakistan. Rumors were floating in 
	Pakistan that in the aftermath of America’s invasion of Afghanistan in 
	November-December 2001, many al-Qaeda soldiers and their leaders had fled to 
	neighboring Balochistan and NWFP to save their heads. For one thing, there 
	was no dearth of local sympathizers of Talibans in that region, which is 
	also known as ‘tribal areas.’ In all likelihood, the local tribal people 
	have given a safe haven to al-Qaeda soldiers. Now they admit it quite 
	openly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	When the Pakistani soldiers attacked the mountainous village in South 
	Waziristan near Wana looking for al-Qaeda militants, they knew right away 
	that they were in hostile territories. Snipers were allover the place in 
	villages dotting Pakistan-Afghan border. The tribal people were sympathetic 
	to al-Qaeda causes; they did not mind taking side while firing and killing 
	Pakistani soldiers. The news of this army casualty was flashed in many 
	newspapers’ front page in the Internet in the last week of September 2004.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Pakistani military wanted to appease the tribal elders because they know 
	that the terrain is difficult over there to fight a conventional war. The 
	fight between the military and Waziri militants took a breather in later 
	part of 2004 for we did not hear the news of more casualties in South 
	Waziristan. Now it is becoming very clear that Pakistani military was in 
	negotiation with the tribal leaders so that they would not hide al-Qaeda 
	militants in the mountain hideouts and not fire at Pakistani military. The 
	news that come out on February 9, 2005 makes it very clear what did happen 
	in the past few months of intense negotiations between the military and the 
	tribal chiefs in South Waziristan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Another piece of news that hit the Internet recently, also attracted my 
	attention. Of all places on earth, the news came from South Waziristan. On 
	February 7, 2005, gunmen killed two Pakistani journalists and wounded 
	another one in the troubled tribal region. The journalists were heading back 
	from an official ceremony held to mark a peace deal between the government 
	and a tribal militant leader when assailants riding in a car opened fire on 
	their vehicle in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan, which is near 
	Afghan border. <br>
	The ceremony was held underneath a tent in Sararogoha, which is located 
	about 80 kilometers northeast of Wana. Based on month-long negotiation, the 
	Pakistani government granted amnesty to a Waziristan renegade Baitullah 
	Mehsud and about 70 of his fighters in return for a pledge not to harbor 
	foreign militants (read al-Qaeda militants). An emotional tribal elder, 
	Maulana Saleh Shah said, “This Pakistan, this Waziristan, this soil belongs 
	to me, I belong to this soil. These Mujahids belong to me, I belong to them; 
	this Pakistani army belongs to me, I belong to this army.” Another tribal 
	leader, Malik Jahangir Khan attending the ceremony said, “Suddenly, somehow, 
	the situation had deteriorated. But sometimes relations can become strained 
	even between father and son. Today, by the grace of Allah, all those 
	brothers who were annoyed with one another, who had some grievances among 
	them, are assembled on one platform, are sitting together.”</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	At the ceremony, the tribal elders, armed fighters and government officials 
	shook hands and offered prayers for the success of the truce, as armed 
	guards of the militants requested media not to take any pictures. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The wave of attacks in Wana, South Waziristan, in September 2004 came as the 
	Pakistani government was trying to quell growing assaults by the tribal 
	militants fighting for more autonomy in the neighboring southwestern 
	province of Balochistan, although many analysts say there was no evidence of 
	links between the two causes, viz., fight for autonomy and giving support to 
	fleeing al-Qaeda militants. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Defying the request of tribesmen, the Pakistani reporters took some photos 
	some of which showed up in the Yahoo news site and that irked some tribal 
	leaders. As the reporters were returning from South Waziristan, shots were 
	fired at them. Hospital sources said two journalists died instantly while 
	another was seriously wounded. While no one has claimed responsibility for 
	the attack, it is widely believed that tribal militants who had abetted 
	al-Qaeda militants some of them may have killed the journalists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	On February 10, 2005, I read in the Internet that the Pakistan government 
	paid huge amounts of money to four of the five most-wanted militants in 
	South Waziristan, who surrendered and signed peace deals with the 
	authorities in November 2004. The money was paid to them so that they could 
	repay the debt they claimed they owed to Al Qaeda. Pakistan’s premier 
	newspaper ‘Dawn’ has learnt about the payment to militant tribal leaders by 
	the military. <br>
	The Pakistani government wanted to appease the militant tribal leaders; 
	therefore, payments were made as part of a package after the militants 
	insisted that they needed the money to pay back a huge sum they had borrowed 
	or taken from Al Qaeda in their fight against Pakistani forces. This is 
	quite a revelation! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	According to the Dawn, the sources said the government paid four tribal 
	leaders from the secret service fund (SS Fund) – a kind of slush fund - and 
	the four militant commanders were brought to Peshawar for signing the peace 
	document in November 2004. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Two of them, Haji Sharif and Maulvi Abbas, received Rupees 15 million each, 
	while Maulvi Javed Karmazkhel and Haji Mohammad Omar were each paid Rupees 1 
	million. Maulvi Abdul Aziz, the fifth militant leader, who also signed the 
	peace deal, was not part of the package and, therefore, did not get any 
	amount. However, the sources said that Maulvi Aziz was now very upset and 
	angry for being ignored and was reportedly pressing the other four militants 
	to give him his share. The payments to the Ahmadzai-Wazir tribal militants 
	were made in January 2005, while Haji Sharif received his share on February 
	4, 2005, the sources said.<br>
	The story dealing with the disbursement of bribe money to Waziri tribal 
	leaders that just came out is very intriguing, to say the least. The tribal 
	leaders are opportunist and they could be easily bought with money. It very 
	well could be that they made up the story about their debt to al-Qaeda. The 
	Pakistani military paying a handful of tribal leaders to win their heart is 
	both intriguing and troubling. America is now in the middle of fighting a 
	global terrorism. Thus, they could easily pay the Pakistani government money 
	to win the heart of tribal leaders. It remains to be seen if the hush money 
	paid to 4-5 tribal leaders in South Waziristan by Pakistani military would 
	bring the expected result, i.e., withdrawing support to the al-Qaeda 
	militants who are in shambles in the wake of American invasion in November 
	2001. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In summary, the news of two Pakistani journalists killed in Wana, South 
	Waziristan, in the hands of tribesmen brought another piece of news that 
	startled many people in Pakistan. It turns out that Pakistani military is 
	now paying bribes to Waziri tribal leaders to win their heart in an effort 
	to catch the remnants of al-Qaeda militants in Pakistan-Afghan border are 
	near northwest Balochistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	This is the strategy of the Bush Administration and Pakistani government 
	headed by General Pervez Musharraf is an eager partner in this venture to 
	wipe out the remaining vestiges of al-Qaeda in that part of the troubled 
	world. If history is any guide, when the bribe money will all vanish, the 
	tribesmen will again side with al-Qaeda remnants to extract more money from 
	Pakistani government. The tribal leaders in that part of the world are 
	unprincipled and the Musharraf Administration knows it very well. However, 
	it is politically expedient to quell the uprise in South Waziristan. 
	Musharraf government is exactly doing that. </font><br>
