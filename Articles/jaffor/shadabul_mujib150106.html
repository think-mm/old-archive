	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ill-informed IT expert by the 
	name Shad Abul (Shadabul) Mujib of Los Angeles who writes ad hominim article 
	and posts them at a blazing speed of his PC in the Internet had ventured out 
	to print media in Bangladesh. However, he was thrashed by a minority 
	community leader in the 'Letters to Editor Page in Daily Star for his 
	execration against Hindus of Bangladesh. I don't think Mr. SA Mujib had the 
	courage to take on Mr. Sanjoy Kumar Nath who did a fine job of showing 
	inanities in his write-up. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Internet is deluged with 
	write-ups many of which are just rant-ridden emotional outbursts. Our 
	newcomer sociopolitical commentrator SA Mujib is a one-trick pony only good 
	at lambasting poor Hindus of Bangladesh and India. Interestingly, there is a 
	strong correlation between India bashing and Sheikh Mujib (Awami League) 
	hating. This is reflected in SA Mujib's various write-ups strewn in myriad 
	e-forums. Lately, he is submitting his magnum opuses to Dhaka's hungry 
	newspaper editor, which they are publishing. One of those articles of his 
	glorifies ultra-nationalism. Filled with patriotic fervor Mr. SA Mujib finds 
	fault with Awami League. Like other Bangladesh Uber Alles folks he thinks 
	India is behind all the problem our motherland presently confronts. To him, 
	the sporadic killing in border area is being done by BSF with evil intent. 
	He conveniently forgets the episode of BDR entering Indian terrorory and 
	killing a whole bunch of BSF personnel in April 2000. This happened only a 
	year or so before the election of 2001during Hasina's rule. It turned out 
	that the BDR chief did it without the consultation of the PM. At the time 
	when this incident took place many analysts thought that it was very unusual 
	for a Major General of BD Army to take on Indian border guards without 
	consulting the office of the PM. I do not remember the name of the 
	disgruntled army general but some newspapers reported that the General 
	joined the army after attending a madrassah. It is not a well-kept secret 
	that Bangladesh army had been infiltrated by Jamaat-loving madrassah 
	graduates. Perhaps there is this faint chance that the BDR killing BSF 
	soldiers in the year 2000 was engineered by AL's foe from a foregn land that 
	had difficulty in effacing the ignonimy of defeat in 1971 (90K + soldiers 
	interned in India in 1972 is hard to forget!). I wondered how could SA Mujib 
	not remember the fact that BDR entered Indian territory and killed a BSF 
	officer on April 16, 2005. Does he have a amnesiac mind or is it that he 
	only remembers the border episode in which BSF is the aggressor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Border skirmishes happen and I for 
	one tend to believe that these sideshows are often engineered by respective 
	government to detract civilians from the main issues. These incidents will 
	take place with regular periodicities as long as we have &quot;soft border,&quot; 
	which lands opportunities to the smugglers. Needless to say, the local MP 
	and police officers routinely get their fair share from burgeoning smuggling 
	operation. An ultra-patriot such as Mr. SA Mujib will however not factor 
	these considerations when he analyzes the news of border skirmishes that are 
	taking place routinely in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lately, Mr. SA Mujib is acting like 
	a bull in a china shop. He is taking the fastest growing Vinnomot forum by 
	the horn. He claims to know the identity of many writers (Hindus) in that 
	forum who writes taking Muslim names. A few months ago he carpingly but 
	naively wrote that Hindus of Bangladesh codone Hindu extremist acts in 
	India. A serious charge, nontheless. He should be very careful about what he 
	writes. The bullets from his loose cannon may boomerang and hurt him. A case 
	in point is the reply from Mr. Sanjoy Kumar Nath from Chittagong. If our 
	intrepid writer has gall, then he should write a retort in Daily Star. Not 
	defending his good name would mean that he could not defend what he writes.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Readers, please read the reply given 
	by Mr. SK Nath. I am also including the original write-up of Mr. SA Mujib 
	down below where he lambasts the Hindus of Bangladesh for apparently no good 
	reason. </font></p>

	Mujib's message (Hindu Extremism, The Daily Star, October 11) and his 
	uninformed generalisations regarding Bangladeshi Hindus and several 
	incorrect assertions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Mujib claims that &quot;not a single 
	Bangladeshi Hindu&quot; condemned the demolition of Babri Masjid. I would like to 
	go on record, as former General Secretary of Dakkhin Chattogram Puja Udjapan 
	Samity back in the early 1990s, that I sent on behalf of our organisation a 
	press declaration (signed by over 100 local members, all Bangladeshi Hindus 
	like myself) to the local and national newspapers protesting this heinous 
	act in India, demanding the mosque be rebuilt and that Indian Muslims be 
	protected by the Indian government after the riots that broke out. I can 
	remember that there were many similar statements and petitions (e.g. from 
	Kendriya Puja Udjapan Parishad, Hindu-Buddha-Christian Oikya Parishad etc). 
	In front of Dhakeswari National Temple in Dhaka, led by the late Sukanta 
	Saha, a human chain was formed demanding justice for minorities in India. 
	Bangladeshi Hindu politicians including Mr Suranjit Sengupta of the Awami 
	League and Mr Goyeshwar Chandra Roy of BNP had also strongly condemned the 
	action. These are not secrets; the national newspapers all covered this. The 
	prime minister, then also Begum Zia, went on television to say that not a 
	single Bangladeshi Hindu was involved in the events in India, and 
	appreciated that Bangladeshi Hindus had played a commendable role in 
	condemning the events in India. Did Mr. Mujib not see any of this? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not have enough information 
	about the BSF killings that Mr Mujib also brings up. But I can say that I 
	personally know of at least one Hindu family who lost a son in border firing 
	by the BSF. His name was Subrata Kundu, and he died in October 2003 after 
	being shot on his way to his shop near the Akhaura border. Ten per cent 
	Bangladeshis are Hindu; it is quite likely that around 10% of those killed 
	by BSF are also Hindu. In fact the number may be higher, as in Khulna, 
	Sylhet, Chittagong and Comilla border areas, the number of Hindus is often 
	higher than the national average. Why is it necessary to communalise such a 
	situation? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, Mr. Mujib has presented gross 
	misrepresentations that can lead to misunderstandings between the amicable 
	Hindu and Muslim people of our country. Either he has not conducted any 
	research, or he is intentionally trying to create divisions at a critical 
	time in our country. Living in America, he may not be aware of how delicate 
	a balance those of us actually living in Bangladesh are all trying to 
	maintain in our day to day lives. Those who are sincere about building 
	prosperity and progress for our motherland will not indulge in such 
	intellectual crimes. Particularly during the sacred time of Ramadan and 
	Durga Puja when the spirit of fraternity and joyousness is at its highest, 
	this kind of misinformation must be protested. </font></p>

	<p align="justify">Letters to Editor </p>
	<p align="justify">Hindu extremism </p>
	<p align="justify">Shadabul Mujib, Los Angeles, US </p>
	<p align="justify">When ruthless extremists kill innocent civilians in the 
	name of Islam, Muslims around the world and in Bangladesh condemn the 
	heinous acts in the strongest possible terms. When some ignorant social 
	elements of Bangladesh are intolerant of other religions, majority of 
	Bangladeshi citizens stand up in defence of the minorities. However, when 
	Indian BSF terrorises the border areas, and kills innocent Bangladeshi 
	nationals, Hindus around the world, and especially in Bangladesh, express no 
	concern. They have so far remained dead silent, and extremely hesitant to 
	criticise the state terrorism of India. </p>
	<p align="justify">Shockingly, not a single Bangladeshi Hindu condemned the 
	&quot;Vishwa Hindu Parishad&quot; (VHP), a terrorist organisation in India which 
	instigated and mobilised one million Hindu fundamentalists on December 6, 
	1992 to destroy the historic Babri Mosque. Not a single Bangladeshi Hindu 
	expressed concern on lifting the ban on VHP (ban lifted on June 21, 1995). 
	VHP, a &quot;JMB&quot; type terrorist organisation, has various organisational wings. 
	The &quot;Bajrang Dal&quot; is the youth militant wing of the VHP, organised in many 
	Indian states. It operates major training camps called &quot;Shakhas&quot;, where 
	thousands of young men train in group activities, receive extreme religious 
	education and learn the so called &quot;self-defensive&quot; arms training. VHP also 
	has a female militant wing called &quot;Durga Vahini&quot; which is also governed by 
	the same principles of &quot;Bajrang Dal&quot;. </p>
	<p align="justify">VHP believes in the declaration of India as a Hindu 
	Rashtra. They are actively financing and campaigning for the implementation 
	of a &quot;Uniform Civil Code&quot; and revocation of &quot;Article 370&quot; of the Indian 
	constitution. It is well financed, and politically connected with BJP. VHP 
	promotes extreme ideology and instigates violence and hatred by spreading 
	lies such as &quot;Muslims and Christians were Hindus in the first place, and 
	that all citizens of Bharat are naturally Hindus.&quot; </p>
	<p align="justify">I wonder how the moderate and tolerant Bangladeshi Hindus 
	can remain silent about such vicious religious propaganda.</p>
