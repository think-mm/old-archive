	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In an open society, the popular view 
	may not always be right. Therefore, the competing ideas should be discussed 
	in an open forum. Bangladesh’s myriad newspapers must play their roles in 
	this regard. Arming with a heavy dose of patriotism anyone could become a 
	hyper-patriot and then, they may suffer from ‘Bangladesh über Alles’ 
	syndrome. Examples of becoming overzealous patriot are aplenty these days.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">THE caption of this article may look 
	funny to unfamiliar eyes. There is no such human malady by the name 
	‘Bangladesh über Alles.’ Therefore, without much ado let me tell you what 
	this phrase really means. After much deliberations I thought I should 
	patterned the title of this article after the German national anthem 
	&quot;Deutschland über Alles,&quot; which means ‘Germany Above All.’ Much to my 
	consternation I also found out quickly that in 1979 a little known 
	Californian punk group by the name the Dead Kennedys (what a disgusting 
	name!) debuted a single EP (extended play) disk in which the title cut was 
	&quot;California über Alles.&quot; That goes to say how original I am. Nevertheless, 
	for today’s purpose this semi-plagiarized title would do mighty fine because 
	I am going to write about this pervasive mentality among our people who 
	think that the good name of Bangladesh be defended rain or shine. These 
	folks have a tendency to show their overt patriotism whenever western 
	writers such as Bertil Lintner or Alex Perry would pen articles to tell the 
	world what an island of paradise Bangladesh has become lately vis-à-vis 
	Islamic fundamentalism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To these patriots, it is either 
	‘Bangladesh über Alles’ or nothing. The same bunch is not sympathetic at all 
	to an ultra-secularist writer, Ms. Taslima Nasrin, because she exposed the 
	repressive dictums of many Hadith by painstakingly removing the veneers that 
	protects the codified Sha’ria laws. These nouveaux (new) hyper-patriots of 
	Bangladesh have unwittingly joined the forces of Islamists in Bangladesh. 
	Even though they say outwardly that they are for progress and modernism, and 
	they will be amongst the first to say that they abhor the obscurantist 
	Mullahs, the same bunch may however tend to give moral support to political 
	parties that are long on religion but short on secularism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islam is a dominant phenomenon in 
	Bangladesh. There is no question about it. This has become more so in the 
	last 25 years. When Sheikh Mijubur Rahman -- the founding father of the 
	nation -- was alive, there was a cultural renaissance going on all over 
	Bangladesh. Joi Bangla was the catch phrase. The newly born nation was not 
	doing great vis-à-vis economic growth. Then again, the seventies were rough 
	time indeed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the U.S., a leadership crisis was 
	going on centering the impeachment of President Nixon from the office. The 
	Cold War rhetoric was not ebbing because the East-West relationship was 
	still hinging on the Brezhnev Doctrine. And then, there was this slump in 
	the Wall Street. The global economic malaise did not help the newly born 
	nation of Bangladesh to stand on its two feet. Under this backdrop, a huge 
	number of Pakistani trained soldiers (including many commissioned officers) 
	had repatriated to the new nation of Bangladesh sometime in 1973. As a last 
	ditch effort to save the nation, Sheikh Mujib floated a united front calling 
	it BAKSAL. This was modeled after USSR, Yugoslavia, Cuba, and many other 
	countries of the East European bloc. The Bangalees were not ready for this 
	kind of political institution. Some saw a danger in it because this 
	one-party rule may turn Bangladesh into a hard-core socialist nation. An 
	evil plan was thus hatched in the cantonment. And we know what did happen 
	next. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bye, bye, Joi Bangla. The new catch 
	phrase &quot;Bangladesh Zindabad&quot; was popularized. To many people it was déjà vu 
	all over again. Welcome to Banglistan of Gen. Ziaur Rahman. The despotic 
	ruler was doing his house cleaning inside the military so much that he 
	became the marked men. He was assassinated in May 1981. For a while things 
	look very murky, politically speaking of course. The flimflam man of 
	Bangladesh, another army General was waiting in the wings. He was very 
	serious about turning the nation into an Islamic paradise for his personal 
	gain. The Saudis and other Middle Eastern nations were watching the events 
	in Bangladesh with watchful eyes. From 1976 through 1990, many Islamic 
	institutions were founded all over Bangladesh. Thanks to Petro-dollars. The 
	spigot was fully opened and one could practically hear the sound of mighty 
	petro-dollars and all the fizz. Bangalees were quenching their thirst at an 
	amazing speed. The nation was getting their Islamic University, Islamic 
	Technical College, and the whole shebang of Islamic institutes. The country 
	changed its secular demeanor going from 1975 to 2000. The number of 
	religious schools, madrassahs, skyrocketed. These religious schools were 
	producing unskilled jihadis many of them ended up in Kashmir and other 
	far-flung places such as Afghanistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Islamists in Bangladesh were 
	daydreaming of conquering land from neighboring Myanmar, Assam, etc., and 
	forming a bigger Islamic Banglistan in South Asia. With this myopic 
	worldview, the Islamists in Bangladesh tried to form a permanent base near 
	Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Ukhiya to goade the Muslim minorities from 
	Myanmar, the Rohingyas. Both Bertil Lintner and Alex Perry have written much 
	about this in recent days in their investigative reports where they have 
	independently mentioned that as of late, Bangladesh has been treading a very 
	dangerous path to Islamism. For their dour conclusion in respect to 
	Bangladesh becoming a paradise for Jihadis, both Lintner and Perry had 
	received odious comments from many newspaper editors, politicians, and 
	prominent citizens of Bangladesh. They inveighed against both Lintner and 
	Perry with their fallacious testimony. Again, the driving force for such 
	overt patriotism is &quot;Bangladesh über Alles&quot; syndrome. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To preserve the good image of 
	Bangladesh—as a moderate Muslim majority nation—the government of Bangladesh 
	has taken an unprecedented step. In the annals of modern history, we have 
	never heard a nation imploring the ambassador of a foreign nation to give 
	testimonials to refute the views of not one but two western reporters. Yes 
	indeed! That has happened. The U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh Ms. Mary Ann 
	Peters spoke highly of Bangladesh vis-à-vis the nation not becoming a safe 
	haven for Jihadi Mullahs in this impoverished nation. She reiterated her 
	previous claim that Bangladesh is a moderate Muslim nation, which does not 
	have any connection to bin Laden’s organization, al-Qaeda. The Bangladesh 
	press and government are using Ms. Peters’ comment as a shield to ward off 
	negative criticism from other writers and commentators. The encomium form 
	Ms. Peters come in the heels of training tens of thousands of Mullahs in 
	Dhaka in an institute funded by the U.S. government. Ms. Peters had attended 
	one ceremony this year sporting a head cover so that no Mullahs are offended 
	by her presence to congratulate the first batch of Mullahs who had received 
	the training. The news of this function was widely publicized in Bangladesh 
	media. If Americans would have thought that no danger could emanate from 
	Bangladesh’s Islamists, then why are they spending dollars to retrain the 
	Mullahs in Bangladesh? The American ambassador cannot have it both ways. In 
	one way, she is giving plaudits to Bangladesh because the nation is not 
	treading the dangerous path to Islamism. On the other hand, to thwart the 
	growing menace of Jihadi Islam in Bangladesh, her government is funding the 
	re-training facility to brainwash the Mullahs. The reason for this American 
	initiative is very simple. In the last Eid prayer in December 2001, the 
	Khatib (head Mullah) of Bangladesh’s national mosque Bait-ul Muqqaram 
	lambasted both America and President Bush in presence of several ministers 
	of Mrs. Khaleda Zia government. No one had reprimanded the Khatib. Some 
	newspaper editors had denounced the anti-American speech of the Khatib in 
	milder language. The American government learned a valuable lesson out of 
	this fiasco. In a hurry, a plan was made to re-train the Mullahs of 
	Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The overt patriotism of many 
	Bangladesh-born expatriates was seen in early 2002 in many cyber sites in 
	the Internet. A controversy just brewed over the role of a human rights 
	group in America that calls itself Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh 
	Minorities or HRCBM. This is essentially a watchdog group to monitor human 
	rights violation of minorities in Bangladesh. There are an estimated 15 to 
	16 million non-Muslims in Bangladesh and about 90% of them are Hindus.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was publicized all over 
	Bangladesh news media that in the aftermath of October 1, 2001, 
	parliamentary election in which the BNP and its alliance of Islamic Parties 
	have own the majority of seats in the national assembly, the minorities were 
	targeted for inhumane torture and repression. Particularly in southern 
	districts of Bangladesh, many Hindus were physically tortured, their houses 
	were set ablaze, their women raped, their ornaments forcibly snatched from 
	their body parts. When these reports were pouring in the news media, the 
	newly appointed government shrugged their shoulder discounting all the news 
	of minority repression. Nonetheless, the communal violence continued. The 
	members of HRCBM then started their campaign to alert many human rights 
	group in the west and also they started lobbying some members of the House 
	of Representatives in the U.S. And their campaign was quite effective. While 
	all of this was going on, a section of Bangladesh’s expatriate communities 
	started their smearing campaign against the HRCBM in the Internet. We were 
	told in no uncertain term that this human rights group was essentially a 
	part of the BJP operatives in the West. A false linkage was thus created 
	only to preserve the good name of Bangladesh. This false and vapid campaign 
	was initiated inspired by the mantra of &quot;Bangladesh über Alles.&quot; The Islamic 
	goons belonging to BNP and her four-party alliance did some ethnic cleansing 
	undoubtedly in October through December of 2001 to create terror among the 
	minorities of Bangladesh. Isn’t it odd that in the pre-partition days in 
	East Bengal, which is essentially Bangladesh now, the Hindus used to 
	comprise about 30-32% of the total population? Sadly, this number had 
	dwindled to about 10-12% now. Every time the communal repression is shoved 
	down the throat of the Hindus in Bangladesh, some Hindus leave their 
	ancestral home and head for West Bengal. The rich and powerful Muslims of 
	the village who also have political connection then annexed the homesteads 
	of the fleeing Hindus. This has been the usual pattern over the last half a 
	century. But then, the likes of Badruddin Omar and Enayetullah Khan would 
	chant &quot;Bangladesh über Alles.&quot; Their chant would then reverberate in the 
	newspapers inside Bangladesh and in myriad Bangladeshi forums in the cyber 
	space. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the last quarter century or so, 
	Bangladesh has engendered many overzealous loyalists. The denominators of 
	this group of sizzling patriots are the following: 1. They are arch 
	anti-Indian; 2. They are soft on Islam; the streak of Pan Islamism runs 
	through their vein; 3. They mostly come from the families that used to vote 
	for the Muslim League candidate in the election during the East Pakistani 
	days; 4. They or their parents showed a lukewarm support for an independent 
	Bangladesh during our struggle in 1971 and they think that the Awami League 
	conspired with India to dismantle Jinnah’s united Pakistan ; 5. They 
	abhorred the leadership of Sheikh Mujib; 6. They are reticent about all the 
	new developments in Bangladesh vis-à-vis establishments of tens and 
	thousands of new madrassahs, and the activities of other fundamentalist 
	mullah brigades. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some of the overzealous vocal 
	patriots of Bangladesh used to be supporters of Uncle Mao or Great Grand Pa 
	Lenin. But then those were the halcyon days in the 1950s and 1960s. The 
	sizzling patriots of the yesteryears are now reformed sexagenarians. Some of 
	the elite members those who used to hang around in Dacca club with the 
	bottles of booze in the olden days are now reformed Muslim-minded Bangalees. 
	A couple of them would easily beat the records of many Hollywood stars as 
	far as their visit to Kazi’s place for tying knots. You see the vicissitudes 
	of time have made them quite mellow now. These aged folks are the spiritual 
	gurus of this ‘Bangladesh über Alles’ movement. Thus, when Bertil Lintner or 
	Alex Perry pen some honest articles, this sizzling patriotic brigade members

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On October 25, 2002, one of the 
	leading newspapers of Dhaka carried a piece of news in their front page that 
	is worth mentioning here because this news has also showed a tinge of 
	‘Bangladesh über Alles’ syndrome. It said that the Foreign Secretary (FS) of 
	Bangladesh thinks that certain quarter is doing an anti-Bangladesh campaign 
	in the Internet. The FS did not name names but he was quick to assert that 
	this campaign will be thwarted in no times. He appealed to his countrymen to 
	confront such campaign. But, how could the citizens of Bangladesh deny that 
	nearly 60,000 madrassahs are producing tons of new recruits for Harkut-ul 
	Jihad, al-Qaeda, and many more fringes that exist in Bangladesh? How could 
	our people ignore the fact that a prominent Islamist who goes by the name 
	Shaikh-ul Hadis, the spiritual guru of Islamic Oikkyo Jot – one of the 
	alliance parties that holds power in Bangladesh at this very time – is also 
	a member of the board of directors of Harkut? These damaging revelations are 
	coming out only to roil the good name of Bangladesh in the international 
	forum. This wayward bound journey of Bangladesh seems to be unidirectional. 
	Thus, the trammels of this collective propaganda by the overzealous 
	loyalists is causing a lot of discomfiture among intelligent expatriates who 
	indeed think that their motherland is headed in the wrong direction away 
	from modernity and progress. The FS of Bangladesh may think that his recent 
	pep talk in the media would enthuse many expatriates to take action against 
	those who write sound articles in newspapers or posts two-liners in a myriad 
	e-forums to give vents to one’s frustration vis-à-vis Islamization of 
	Bangladesh. All his cavorting in the media would amount to nothing much. The 
	expatriates are an intelligent bunch anyway. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More eye-catching examples of 
	‘Bangladesh über Alles’ syndrome could be culled from various Bangalee cyber 
	forums in the Internet. However, that will be overkill. The gentle readers 
	have gotten the idea what this over-patriotism could lead us to. Now that 
	democracy is in secure place in Bangladesh, what the citizens should do is 
	allow all the institutions of democracy to flourish in the land. The ability 
	to take criticism against our society, culture, polity, etc., no matter how 
	severe it might be, should be promoted by all means. Criticism does not mean 
	that the nation is going to pots. Often criticism may lead to a healthy 
	debate. And Bangladesh’s citizens may get to see the proverbial two sides of 
	the coin. If however, dissident voice is not allowed to speak, then, it is a 
	sure sign of trouble. We have observed with trepidation that both the 
	leaders of Awami League and BNP do not allow criticism of their policy 
	vis-à-vis the governance of the nation. Both the leaders have failed 
	miserably to understand the essence of democracy. Maybe, when hundreds of 
	newspaper articles will be published to demonize the ills of not allowing 
	people to speak their minds, the politicians will get the message in a 
	hurry. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The political leaders should get 
	this idea into their head that many a time a dissenting view is probably a 
	saner view. In an open society, the popular view may not always be right. 
	Therefore, the competing ideas should be discussed in an open forum. 
	Bangladesh’s myriad newspapers must play their roles in this regard. Arming 
	with a heavy dose of patriotism anyone could become a hyper-patriot and 
	then, they may suffer from ‘Bangladesh über Alles’ syndrome. Examples of 
	becoming overzealous patriot are aplenty these days. This article is a small 
	effort to remind our folks everywhere that competing ideas often shape the 
	future of a society. Therefore, rather than criticizing a dissenter in 
	scathing language a healthy debate should be ensued in public forums such as 
	in daily newspapers. The government or the civil society won’t lose anything 
	by allowing such debate to take place. Three cheers for an open society! And 
	that is my ardent hope. </font></p>
