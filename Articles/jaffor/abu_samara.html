	early on Jumma Day (Muslim Sabbath Day), September 28, 2007 I learned via an

	say – a diatribe-ridden from <i>Alif</i> to <i>Yaa</i>, and published in a 
	vernacular newspaper on September 24, 2007 by the name <i>Naya Diganta</i> 
	(New Horizon).&nbsp; In this article, he poured his venom to freethinker writers 
	who originated from

	reveal all kinds of inanities in the religion of “peace” dating back from 7<sup>th</sup>

	Bangladesh</span>.&nbsp; Move forward to September 2007 and you will find some 
	truth to what I am propounding here.&nbsp; Just the other day the government 
	arrested a twenty year old budding cartoonist by the name Arif.&nbsp; The kid is 
	languishing in jail for a piece that he wrote and drew.&nbsp; It was an innocuous 
	cartoon poking fun at the very people like Abu Samara who takes the hadiths 
	(example set by Prophet Muhammad) literally.&nbsp; These people because of their 
	reverence to Prophet Muhammad opined that the cartoon had offended the

	Bangladesh</span> .&nbsp; The government who through their action had proved that 
	they are friendly to Mullahs’ cause had quickly acted and arrested the kid.&nbsp; 
	And that is not the end of it.&nbsp; The editor of vernacular newspaper <i>
	Prothom Alo</i>, which published the piece in their magazine by the name 
	“Al-Pin” (Arabesque way of putting it), not only apologized in public but 
	also went to the national mosque asking the forgiveness of <i>Ulemas</i> 
	(learned mullahs) in a highly publicized <i>Tauba</i> Ceremony.&nbsp; Many a 
	reader thought the editor asked the forgiveness on behalf of secular 
	writers.&nbsp; The mullahs had sardonic laugh allover their face and many of them 
	may have interpreted the ceremony as the capitulation of secular ideals from

	strongly denounce his malevolence that he showed out of hatred that he 
	harbors against Avijit Roy, Fatemolla, Taj Hashmi, Mehul Kamdar, and of

	Bangla Bhai, Shaikh Abdur Rahman, and many of his followers and their 
	subsequent trials that led to the walking of the Islamists to gallows all 
	point to the fact that we were right in our assertion.&nbsp; One could easily 
	draw the conclusion that the real face behind Abu Samara is born loser 
	Bangalee belonging to Rajakar party – Jamaat.&nbsp; The reason he hates the 
	secularists is because we are like thorns in his path to Islamism.</font></span></p>
