	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Terrorism linked to Islamic 
	fundamentalism had been rising in Bangladesh (a nation of about 145 million) 
	since mid 1990s. A section of terrorists who are using violence to propagate 
	their brand of Islamism in the impoverished nation want to establish Sha’ria-based 
	judiciary. These Islamists have ushered in a new arsenal in the country, 
	which is suicide bombing on Tuesday, November 29, 2005. The members of the 
	violent Islamic group had hit court houses in two cities, namely, Chittagong 
	and Gazipur (formerly known as Joydebpur but changed the name to show 
	Islamic demeanor of Bangladesh since August 1975) killing at least 9 people 
	and injuring nearly 100 people. This new wave of attack against judiciary of 
	Bangladesh is a symbolic one. The Islamists favoring Sha’ria law for the 
	nation do not believe in secular laws. To show their disdain for manmade law 
	they are now targeting Bangladesh’s court system. This is theirs unique way 
	of thumbing nose to judiciary of this nation. Ordinary people will be 
	scarred to visit the courthouses lest they are injured by the bomb. 
	Islamists are very clever; they know that their brand of scare tactic works 
	rather well in this overpopulated nation. This scribe had forewarned the 
	intelligentsia and politicians of Bangladesh by writing a slue of articles 
	but all the suggestion on how to combat the growing menace fell on the deaf 
	ear. I was labeled an alarmist by a handful of writers while the government 
	of Khaleda Zia was not happy knowing that I supported the seminal articles 
	written by Mr. Bertil Lintner, Mr. Alex Perry, and Ms. Eliza Griswold. These 
	are not puny journalists as one may think in Bangladesh. Mr. Lintner wrote 
	for the Far Eastern Economic Review, Mr. Perry wrote for the Times while Ms. 
	Griswold published her article on growth of Islamic fundamentalism in New 
	York Times. By early 2000 it was clear that Bangladesh society was heading 
	for more violence led by Islamists. In the early phase, the jihadists blew 
	up cultural programs and their wrath fell on communists and secularists. 
	Under that backdrop, Mr. Lintner, Mr. Perry, and Ms. Griswold wrote their 
	articles that sensed an impending evil for Bangladesh under the hands of 
	Islamic extremists. But guess what the reactions were? The government of 
	Khaleda Zia banned the articles written by these respected journalists. Mrs. 
	Zia and her lieutenants were all upset while they proclaimed that these 
	articles are marring the good image of Bangladesh as moderate Muslim 
	majority nation. The Khaleda Administration went so far as asking expatriate 
	groups in the West to campaign against these articles written by the 
	“foreigners” that are so critical of her government. It has not eluded 
	Lintner, Perry, and Griswold that Khaleda Zia shook hand with Jamaat to win 
	the election in October 2001. Therefore, her government was looking the 
	other way when Islamic goons were blasting grenades, bombs, and whatnot to 
	create instability in the nation. The Khaleda Zia administration was not the 
	only critique of Mr. Lintner, Mr. Perry, and Ms. Griswold. The leading 
	newspaper editors of Dhaka also became suddenly very patriotic as they 
	hurled epithets to the “foreign” reporters calling them reactionaries, 
	sensationalists, and their work – examples of yellow journalism. The late 
	Enayetullah Khan of ‘New Age’ pooh-poohed the “foreign” reporters calling 
	their findings figment of imagination. How wrong was the editor of ‘New 
	Age?’ It took late Enayetullah Khan at least three years before he called 
	spade a spade. He realized that he was wrong all along. From his death bed 
	he had the courage and fortitude to fire the warning shot against the 
	fundamentalists who are bent on creating anarchy in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lately, a handful of lawmakers 
	belonging to the ruling party are threatening to spill the beans; these 
	politicians are saying that the government of Khaleda Zia is protecting the 
	Islamists because they belong to the party Jamaat-i-Islami, which is a 
	leading coalition partner of BNP. One of the dissident BNP lawmakers was 
	disciplined and booted out of the party by Khaleda Zia for breaking party 
	discipline. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In May 2004 when ‘Bangla Bhai’ 
	menace came into the fore, quite a few parliament members from the western 
	districts of Bangladesh belonging to the ruling BNP gave protection to the 
	extremist leader while the police became silent spectators doing nothing but 
	aiding and abetting the leaders and members of Jagrata Muslim Janata of 
	Bangladesh (JMJB) who were torturing and killing minority Hindus and others 
	who protested the scare tactics of Islamic goons. The charade became a 
	public affair when in the town of Rajshahi the ‘Bangla Bhai’ men paraded the 
	street in motorcade with the assi tance of Deputy Inspector General, 
	Superintendent, and officer-in-charge of that city. The entire police force 
	was in fact backing up the Islamic terrorists while Khaleda Zia, the 
	premier, was thinking what to do with Bangla Bhai. Finally, she was forced 
	to issue an arrest warrant for the extremist leader under pressure from 
	newspaper reports and donor countries. However, by then, ‘Bangla Bhai’ and 
	his lieutenants went underground. The same police that protected the leader 
	and followers of JMJB in Rajshahi told the newsmen that the terrorists and 
	their leader have probably gone to neighboring West Bengal. I am not making 
	this up. Anyone could visit the archive of on-line newspapers and read the 
	details of police statement. In summary, the police and Khaleda Zia 
	Administration have backed ‘Bangla Bhai’ and his men in the summer months of 
	2004. Only after details of torture and killings were publicized in 
	newspaper, and the political pressure exerted by donor nations became too 
	unbearable did Khaleda Zia Administration made the volte-face and started to 
	initiate a massive manhunt to arrest ‘Bangla Bhai’ and his men. It has been 
	over a year since police were crisscrossing Bangladesh in search of the 
	terrorist leaders but the man has simply vanished into the thin air. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The spate of bombing is on the rise 
	in Bangladesh for at least six years. The blasting of grenades reached a 
	catastrophic proportion on August 21, 2004, when dozens of military-grade 
	hand grenades were lobbed on Sheikh Hasina and her lieutenants as Awami 
	League organized an outdoor rally. The leader was miraculously saved but she 
	lost a few of her trusted party leaders. A year later on August 17, 2005, 
	the Islamists blasted over 500 bombs over a period of one hour in every 
	administrative district. The firepower of these homemade bombs was very low; 
	consequently only 2 deaths resulted from the blasts. But the event was a 
	highly “successful” one. The Islamists proved the point that they are well 
	organized to blast hundred of bombs or hand grenades synchronously. That 
	event alone scared the hell out of all the newspaper editors and 
	intelligentsia of Bangladesh. The blast was a watershed in the annals of 
	Bangladesh history. It was only after 8-17 blasts that the nation shook and 
	shivered knowing fully well that Islamists are united to unleash their 
	firepower. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As these menacing acts were acting 
	out in various parts of Bangladesh the government of Khaleda Zia took her 
	case to the people. This time the plea was as follows: these bombings were 
	done by the intelligence department of a neighboring nation. To give 
	credence to her cock-and-bull story she asked a lone Justice to look into 
	the incident of August 21, 2004, bombing of public meeting that took place 
	in Bongobandhu Avenue. A Justice by the name Joynul Abedin went as far as 
	saying that a foreign government with the assistance of local hoodlums 
	engineered the blasts. The government of Khaleda Zia knew who were behind 
	the blasts because their proverbial thumb impressions were left allover the 
	crime scene. A few knowledgeable people inside Bangladesh even hinted the 
	involvement of military. But to refute all the claims Mrs. Zia had to invent 
	this conspiracy theory to malign Bangladesh’s next-door neighbor. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The event of 8-17 marathon blasts 
	changed the perception of Bangladeshi people vis-à-vis who is behind the 
	crime. The Islamists now make no bones about who is the mastermind behind 
	the blasts. They took full credit for the blasts. Therefore, the battle line 
	is being drawn. The Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, is now on a fix. How to 
	handle the matter without creating a rift with her coalition member, Jamaat, 
	who many in Bangladesh think is the party behind the grenade and homemade 
	bomb blasts. It remains to be seen how these episodes of bomb blasts against 
	judges, and courthouse play out in Bangladesh. The ordinary citizens are 
	simply fed up with the spate of blasts. There may be many surprises waiting 
	to happen when the next parliamentary election takes place in the country. 
	The ruling party may have to pay a price for being so cozy with the 
	Islamists. Bangladesh’s history is replete with surprise; the time between 
	now and the next parliamentary election is eon away and many events may 
	unfold. Therefore, stay tuned. Oh, one more thing. Bangladesh’s politics is 
	full of caprice; therefore, one never knows what is in store for this 
	unpredictable nation.</font></p>
