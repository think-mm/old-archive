	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama is no longer the 
	“presumptive” nominee of his party for the highest office in the land. After 
	affirmation by proclamation, he facilely won the nomination; there weren’t 
	any fight from any rival faction. This happened on the third night (August 
	27, 2008). The jubilant candidate for White House made a surprise appearance 
	before delegates in the Pepsi Center (an indoor sports arena) when he 
	invited everyone to get ticket for Invesco Field (an outdoor sports arena) 
	where he gave a historic acceptance speech before 84,000 Americans. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <a href="#Speech">famous speech</a> 
	had spellbound not only the delegates and attendees at the venue but many 
	newscasters, political talking heads and pundits such as David Gergen, John 
	King, etc., had opined that it was truly a historic speech by any measure.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Obama had re-introduced 
	himself to Americans through this speech, which lasted about 50 minutes. It 
	was a defining moment for Obama, son of a Kenyan and a Midwestern woman. 
	Through the acceptance speech, he rebutted quite a few allegations leveled 
	by the McCain campaign. The issue of Obama’s inexperience for the highest 
	job in the land, lack of foreign policy experience, the celebrity-like 
	status, etc, and more were answered by Obama to dispel any doubts about his 
	qualification to become the commander-in-chief or for that matter, taking 
	the emergency call at 3:00 am. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obama spoke eloquently before the 
	crowd and national audiences through the airwaves. He looked quite dignified 
	and presidential; not to mention his utmost confidence in him. The speech 
	was a reminiscence of the one given about 40 years ago by Reverend martin 
	Luther King Jr. at Washington DC in a civil rights protest march. In fact 
	Obama concluded his speech by borrowing phrases from M. L. King’s speech.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most political observers in America 
	said during the convention that Obama had a huge task of unifying the 
	Democratic base, which was shattered by lengthy and divisive primaries. 
	Furthermore, he had to present a memorable acceptance speech, which he gave. 
	Now, there is no question in the minds of millions about his qualification 
	to become the president of this powerful nation on earth. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a true sense destiny had brought 
	Obama to national politics. As a fresh lawyer just graduated from Harvard he 
	joined a movement to rehabilitate displaced workers in the late 1980s in 
	south side of Chicago. Stunned by his capability to organize movement many, 
	Illinois people asked him to join the state politics. He however took time 
	out to teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago and in late 
	1990s he immersed in the state politics to find himself elected to the state 
	legislature. Springfield, the capital of Illinois is located in the middle 
	of cornfield, became his home for few years when he learned and honed the 
	art of persuasion quite well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2004, during the Democratic 
	convention at Boston where Senator Kerry was nominated to run against George 
	Bush, the party selected an unknown legislator from Springfield, Illinois to 
	give the keynote speech. His name was a strange one and no one was familiar 
	with him. Nonetheless, he gave an electrifying speech. After which he became 
	right away a star in the Democratic Party. Obama ran for the senate seat 
	from Illinois and was elected in November 2004. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a young senator he quickly 
	learned that Washington was a place where senators and congressmen play a 
	partisan game to the detriment of the nation. By defying the norm he started 
	mingle with legislators from the other side of the aisle. Bipartisanism 
	became his mantra at the senate. Obama could hardly get a senior position in 
	the myriads of exclusive committees those that oversee many branches of the 
	government. But that hardly deterred him from getting the visibility. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obama’s political future took a 
	quantum leap in 2007 when to the surprise of many he announced that he would 
	run in the primaries that was already crowded with nationally known 
	Democrats. Many political pundits had pooh-poohed him for becoming that 
	ambitious being merely a political neophyte. Come to think of it, I don’t 
	think that it hardly crossed Senator Hillary Clinton’s mind that this 
	obscure and junior legislator from Illinois could through a hardball in her 
	ambition to receive the nomination of her party further down the road.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In actuality, the farmers and most 
	ordinary people of Iowa had catapulted Barack of Obama to presidential 
	politics in January 2008 when he won decisively in the primaries in Iowa in 
	which Senator Clinton came out the third. Suddenly, Obama’s campaign caught 
	fire while his message resonated with the voters allover America. What 
	followed next is known to everyone. To put it mildly, Obama is a political 
	phenomenon the like of which was never seen before! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The events of last few weeks did not 
	bode well for Obama campaign. And thanks to John McCain’s negative campaign. 
	Consequently, Senator Obama came to Denver all bruised. First, it was 
	Senator Hillary Clinton’s campaign that hurled all kinds of epithets to 
	characterize him as an inexperienced first time senator who is not fit to be 
	the president of this great nation. Then once he secured enough delegates to 
	lock the nomination, the McCain campaign started in earnest a fusillade of 
	negative Ads. They borrowed lines from Clinton’s negative Ads, made them 
	caustic and bitter and aired them in the battleground states. When Obama 
	visited Europe, Middle East in the summer of 2008 to meet the heads of 
	states, he chanced to give speech in a soccer stadium in Berlin. It was a 
	feat that John McCain could hardly repeat. Thus, to belittle Obama, the 
	McCain campaign had coined the term “world class celebrity” to stick it on 
	Obama. And that was not all. The democratic presidential hopeful was 
	compared with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, the two most sought after 
	celebrity by the National Enquirer, which is a popular gossip magazine in 
	America. Unfortunately, McCain’s mischaracterization of Obama had backfired. 
	In polls after polls, Obama came out a few percentages ahead and that is 
	causing a concern in the minds of Republican operatives such as Karl Rove.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, the last week of August 
	arrived and Democrats assembled in Denver to give their seal of approval to 
	Obama to recapture White House after 8 years when Bill Clinton left the 
	catbird seat power with a strong economy, a reasonable peace throughout the 
	world, and a huge budget surplus. </font></p>

	<b>Part-6</b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All attentions of the media were on 
	Democratic convention, which ran very smoothly. Some political talking heads 
	and a few Republican operatives thought the convention would be mired in 
	utter chaos and floor fight a la 1968 convention held in Chicago in the 
	height of the Vietnam War. The Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert 
	Humphrey, was bruised by all the street protestation and floor fight. The 
	result was a divided Democratic Party; consequently, VP Humphrey lost the 
	election to Richard M. Nixon in 1968. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Democrats did not wish for a 
	return of 1968-like convention. Rather they wanted a unified front to 
	energize the campaign this year. The Clintons were very cooperative in this 
	respect. All the fences were mended and both Bill and Hillary Clinton gave 
	excellent and uplifting speeches at the convention to efface any sign of 
	discord and division. At the end, the party was unified to the satisfaction 
	of Obama campaign. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a way, Senator Barack Obama had a 
	tryst with destiny in Denver. His journey to politics got underway in 1997 
	and in a short span of 11 years he received the nomination of his party to 
	run for the highest office. His candidacy is unique in the sense that he 
	does not quite fit the description of a politician who runs for the coveted 
	position. Thus far, all the presidents were male and white. Are Americans 
	ready to elect a minority? Stay tuned for the answer. In about 67 days 
	Americans would go to polling places to elect a new president. The 
	collective judgment will surely come. </font></p>
