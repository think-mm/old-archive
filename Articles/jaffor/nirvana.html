    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">This short article is about
    how one could free him or her from the bondage of a blind belief system to
    which we are indoctrinated to in our formative years.&nbsp; To this end,
    many enlightened readers have taken the onus on them to unearth truth and
    point out gross inanities embedded in Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; I congratulate
    them for their monumental success.&nbsp; Also much kudos to the scientists,
    engineers, and software developers who made this Internet a great new
    information highway.&nbsp; Despite all these positive development, we have
    amongst us some obscurantists who are trying to through the proverbial
    monkey wrench to spoil the journey we happily undertook in 1997-98 when the
    Internet just got started.&nbsp; <O>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Readers of e-forums must
    have seen a handful of hecklers who are trying their best to create
    confusion and disturb the serenity of cyber forums with their nagging
    complain.&nbsp; When these folks have nothing better to do in life, they
    pick on writers, essayists, commentators, etc., by hurling epithets such as
    “Bongo-Chelabi,” “Bhandari,” and whatnot.&nbsp; Lately, a newcomer
    to this mudslinging came a new participant who just proposed to form a
    government of Bangladesh in exile.&nbsp; Some humor – one might say!&nbsp;
    The other nagger from United Arab Emirate who wants to straddle on both
    liberal and illiberal camps also have quoted the “position” that was
    bestowed on me by an unknown participant who call himself “Truth Is
    Might” and who mailed the article all the way from Auckland, New Zealand.&nbsp;
    If these are done in bantering mode, then it is all right.&nbsp; But I
    hardly doubt the motive could be anything but banter (good-humored and
    playful conversation).<O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">The hecklers are out there
    because they have no valid arguments to refute the economic data provided by
    Mr. Quddus Khan of Vinnomot to show that Muslim countries in the world are
    lagging behind economically to such nation as Israel.&nbsp; I do not have
    the audacity to compare the moribund (dying) economy of Muslim nations with
    that of developed Western nations.&nbsp; It is conceivable that the way
    things are moving for India and China, in just 50 years time Bangladesh and
    Pakistan may still remain as LDC whereas the other two nations may well be
    approaching the status of either developed nations or on their way to become
    one. <O>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Through my writings, I have
    depicted various inanities in our motherland.&nbsp; I have also coined the
    phrase “Bangladesh über Alles” at least two years ago to show the
    mindset of most Bangladeshi folks who think that there is nothing wrong in
    our motherland vis-à-vis modernity.&nbsp; However, lately, I am being
    criticized for my straight talks.&nbsp; I have been writing on the issue of
    how Islamization of Bangladesh for over three decades have taken the nation
    to an abysmal pit and there is no sign that the nation is about to make a
    U-turn from the retrogressive journey.&nbsp; But my opponents are not
    countering my arguments; instead, they started a negative campaign to
    undermine whatever scholarship I do have.&nbsp; <O>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">The main protagonist in this
    vilification campaign is one who writes under an assumed female name (in
    fact most detractors of secularist writers pen under assumed name) acts like
    a typical termagant.&nbsp; Hurling epithets to anyone who criticizes Islam
    for not promoting progress in this world is this person’s pastime.&nbsp; I
    have repeatedly mentioned that the e-forums that we have are not scholarly
    forums.&nbsp; Therefore, we should never pretend that each and every one of
    us is “expert” in any given field.&nbsp; We simply express our opinion
    on matters that concern us.&nbsp; For this reason after 9-11 terrorist
    attacks, we have become very vocal on global terrorism perpetrated by the
    followers of Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; Many of us by now have studied the
    tenets of Wahhbism to understand the Jihadi mindset of many Muslim
    terrorists.&nbsp; But our cyber hecklers are crying foul saying that we have
    this tendency to blame Islam, which they opined as the religion of peace.&nbsp;
    Many secularists have reluctantly taken the onus on them to prove that Islam
    is anything but a religion of peace.&nbsp; Mr. Abul Kasem, Mr. S.K. Mirza,
    Mr. Fatemolla, Mr. Ashgar, and a few more Bangalee writers have done their
    probing on violence perpetrated on womenfolk in the advent of Islam under
    prophet Muhammad’s diktat especially on Jewish people.&nbsp; These authors
    have shown conclusively that Muhammad’s army did gratuitous killing on
    Bani Qureiza people.&nbsp; Many of the same Bangalee writers have profusely
    penned their essays on Jihad in the aftermath of 9-11 terror attacks.&nbsp;
    Still then the obscurantist hecklers are saying, “Oh no, you can’t
    possibly translate Arabic phrase into English.”&nbsp; You see these folks
    are trying to tell us that Arabic phrases in Qur’an should be left alone.&nbsp;
    The other absurd thing they are saying that mortal human will never be able
    to decipher Allah’s word spoken to Muhammad.&nbsp; In truth, these cyber
    hecklers are admitting that there are many incongruities in Qur’anic
    dictums.&nbsp; This cunning bunch is trying to hush this up.&nbsp;
    Therefore, they say, “Don’t you try translating Qur’anic phrases
    because the meaning may have changed in the last 1400 years.”<O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">To these hecklers may I say
    that please mind your own business.&nbsp; If you cannot defend the inanities
    in many Qur’anic phrases, then give up and embrace the views propounded by
    the secularist writers of Bangladesh origin.&nbsp; In English, there is this
    phrase – if you can’t beat them, join them.&nbsp; There is no harm
    joining the secularist writers who are using a rational approach to show the
    incongruities that abound in religious scriptures no matter be it from
    Islam, Christianity, or Hinduism.&nbsp; Humankind has come a long way since
    the days of Buddha, Christ, and Muhammad.&nbsp; Science has sought answers
    to unearth many mysteries of physical world.&nbsp; The laws of conservation
    of mass and thermodynamic principles have been elucidated to show that some
    physical laws and principles bind us earthlings.&nbsp; In nineteenth
    century, a Cambridge don by the name Charles Darwin came up with the idea
    that species evolve due to evolution and not due to whim of almighty.&nbsp;
    A Christian monk in Austria by the name Gregor Mendel again in mid
    nineteenth century while playing with pea plants as a hobby showed how
    traits are genetically controlled.&nbsp; He gave us the concept of gene.&nbsp;
    A century later, a Briton named Francis Crick and a Mid-Westerner by the
    name James Watson showed us the three-dimensional structure of the primary
    constituent of gene, which is DNA.&nbsp; Within the next 30 years, a new
    field of Genetic Engineering was established.&nbsp; Because of the growth in
    this field now human insulin is produced in bacterial cells.&nbsp; Oh, yes,
    none of what I have mentioned can be found in Old Testament, Bhagabat Geeta,
    Qur’an, or in any Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; Similarly, no mention of
    electron, proton, neutron, positron, or any sub-atomic particles are
    mentioned in any Holy Scriptures either.&nbsp; It is a foregone conclusion
    of modern science that we human beings are here because of the right
    chemistry that promotes life on earth.&nbsp; Simply put, had there been no
    oxygen in earth’s atmosphere, there would be any life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Revolutionary ideas regarding our existence on earth are being explained by
    such new idea as Anthropic Principle.&nbsp; <O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
    </O>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Our cyber hecklers won’t
    make them acquainted with these revolutionary ideas lest they lose their
    “Iman” or faith.&nbsp; They are here to create impediment to human
    progress.&nbsp; At every opportunity, they shout: “Oh, what do you know
    about God’s wisdom.&nbsp; He has a grand scheme of which you know
    nothing.”<O>

    liberated friends I say, continue your work.&nbsp; A time will come in the
    future when all the obscurantist of the world will realize one day that they
    were blind all these years.&nbsp; It is rather a difficult thing to rid
    one’s prejudices and blind faith.&nbsp; It takes a lot of reading and
    courage to become an apostate.&nbsp; Very few Bangalees will attain this
    Nirvana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
