	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A quiet peasant revolution against 
	the authority was in the making in the first four months of 2006 in 
	northwestern part of Bangladesh, which hardly drew the attention of national 
	media. Now don’t get me wrong! The national newspapers covered the news but 
	only when police fired at the rebellious peasants. This happened once in 
	January and twice in April. Up until now (April 12, 2006), a total of 20 
	peasants had died in the bloody conflict. Just think for a moment, twenty 
	people had to give their life before the conflict made a splash in the major 
	newspapers of Bangladesh. On April 13 quite a few write-ups graced the pages 
	of daily newspapers and few editorials criticizing the sanity of Khaleda Zia 
	Administration also were published on the same day. Do you think 
	Bangladesh’s PM who is euphoric about her just completed foreign trips would 
	pay much attention to the news? Nay! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I browsed the Internet forums where 
	expatriate Bangalees visit to get information about their homeland. I was 
	disappointed seeing no mention of Kansat killings anywhere. The deshi 
	Internetters had no idea where Kansat is located. By the sound of it, many 
	of us had erroneously thought that the place is located in the West. 
	Fortunately, some international news agency had published in full color the 
	picture of the conflict. One could clearly see that
	<a href="../../human_rights/kansat2006/index.html">the peasants “armed” with 
	bamboo sticks</a> that looked like our folks. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why the peasants from Kansat 
	(located near Chapai Nawabganj) took to the streets to voice their anguish? 
	Do they have a real gripe? Or, was it that they were bored to death and they 
	wanted to have some excitement in the advent of spring and Bengali New Year. 
	It turns out that the peasants from this remote area of Bangladesh that is 
	located about 250 kilometers from Dhaka have a legitimate complaint against 
	the electric supply department of Bangladesh. They say that they receive 
	very little electricity per day; hardly 1-2 hours with which they cannot do 
	any agricultural operations. Each month they pay a fixed amount of money no 
	matter how much electricity comes to their doorsteps. And to make the matter 
	worse, some men from the electricity department is charging Taka 10 every 
	month as meter rental fees, which the peasants say are not in the contract. 
	So, they formed a protest body calling it ‘Palli Bidyut Unnayan Sangram 
	Committee’ (PBUSC) or ‘Action Committee for Rural Power Development.’ 
	through which they started making complaints. When they first took to the 
	streets in January this year, the government decided to crush the movement 
	by following a scorched-earth policy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The peasants told the newsmen that 
	like everyone else in the nation they also need electricity to do their farm 
	chores. In one sense their livelihood is linked with the availability of 
	electricity. The movement had grown by leaps and bounds. An estimated 12,000 
	strong local peasants from few scattered villages have joined the movement 
	and it seems like they are ready to go to the bitter end to bring a closure 
	to this problem of receiving a smidgen of electricity. The peasants’ 
	complaint is legitimate but the government of Khaleda Zia is turning a deaf 
	ear to their plea. Instead of sending a troubleshooter or a local member of 
	the parliament the government, which is out of touch with reality, had 
	labeled these innocent peasants as terrorists. It has become a second nature 
	to Khaleda Zia, the PM of Bangladesh, to crush any dissension by bullets. 
	Many civil rights organizations in Bangladesh have raised the issue that the 
	police and sharpshooters (RAB) have killed many people whoever they thought 
	are criminals. The government is so much used to deal with mass 
	demonstration with force that it sent police and BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) to 
	quell the uprising. This insane approach had resulted in the death of 20 
	peasants some are only 15-16 years old. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Kansat uprising is a unique case 
	of civil disobedience in this nascent democracy. The peasants are apolitical 
	but have elected the ruling party candidate in the parliamentary election, 
	which might change according to disgruntled villagers. The peasants have no 
	leader or spokesperson but they follow the decisions made by the committee. 
	Until recently, no political parties were interested listening to their 
	grievances. On April 13, 2006 the 14-party opposition group had meetings 
	with the villagers and promised to apply political pressure to the 
	government so that they receive electricity for irrigation in the leaner 
	months. The government now realizes that things have gone too far and they 
	might lose a valuable seat in the next parliamentary election. Therefore, a 
	spokesperson from the government had promised to bring a closure to the 
	problem. The rebel peasants are so incensed by the apathy of the government 
	that they may not trust the authorities at anytime soon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To bring a perspective to peasant 
	rebellion in Bengal let me delved into history of our motherland. Bengal is 
	famous for peasant revolution dating back to Mughal time. In Jessore, a 
	local Hindu Raja by the name Pratapaditya gave leadership to a rebellion 
	against the mighty Mughal, which nearly cost him his life during 1610-1612. 
	The heroic tales of Raja Pratapaditya engendered many legends and folklore 
	in Bengal. Novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in late nineteenth century 
	wrote novels based on peasant rebellion including one by the ascetic 
	sanyasis. The novella Anandamoth describes in details how sanyasis fought 
	the invading force. Bankim’s another novella ‘Sitaram’ also gave graphic 
	description of another peasant uprising in Bengal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the middle of twentieth century 
	right before Bengal was partitioned based on M.A. Jinnah’s dubious 
	Two-nation theory, an uprising by the name Tebhaga Andolon (sharecroppers’ 
	movement) had exemplified the supreme sacrifice and tenacity of rural folks. 
	The Nachole uprising near Kansat, Chapai Nawabganj in 1950 by Santal tribe 
	was patterned after Tebhaga Andolon. In the next fifty-six year we have not 
	seen any such organized peasant movement. Is it possible that the young 
	generation in Kansat may have heard about the heroic tale of Tebhaga and 
	Nachole Andolon? I have no clue but as per oral tradition, which is very 
	common in Bengal, the villagers may have heard the tales of the past 
	uprisings. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In summary, the peasants from 
	villages near Kansat, Chapai Nawabganj had organized a movement to demand 
	their fair share of electricity during January to April 2006. The government 
	instead of settling issue peacefully turned the conflict into a bloody one. 
	So far 20 people have died and the affected villagers are fleeing their home 
	in droves for safety. The uprising had surprised many people in Bangladesh. 
	The Amnesty International also had made an appeal and so did Mukto-Mona 
	forum in the Internet for government’s restraint and to bring the matter to 
	a peaceful closure. In democracy people have every right to demonstrate 
	peacefully. The government of Khaleda Zia had mistakenly labeled the 
	peasants as “terrorists” and applied her scorched-earth policy to bend the 
	back of the peasants. It had made the matter worse. Now that opposition 
	parties in Bangladesh and outsiders have heard the plights of Kansat people 
	we could only hope that the peasants’ meager demand will be met. The Kansat 
	people had indeed paid the price of electricity with their blood. In 
	democracy, no government should be as tyrannical as Khaleda Zia government. 
	Perhaps, the legacy of cantonment politics runs through her vein. If I am 
	not wrong, her party was engendered in Kurmitola cantonment. What more could 
	you expect! <br>
