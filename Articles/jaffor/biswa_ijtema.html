  A.H. Jaffor Ullah</font></b></center>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Every year, Bangladesh’s Tablig Al Jamaat
  hosts religiously a religious program calling it <i>Bishwa Ijtema - </i>a
  hybrid term, half Sanskrit, half Arabic.&nbsp; As far as Ijtema is concerned,
  this year is no exception.&nbsp; The program that is intended to rejuvenate
  Islamic ideals among Bangladesh’s 114 million Muslims starts this year on
  December 13 that is going to continue until December 15 with its usual <i>Akheri
  Munazat </i>(Final Supplication).</font>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">If last year’s reporting of the event is
  any guide, the newspapers will be printing not only the accounts of the
  program, they will also publish all kinds of photos.&nbsp; All these photos
  that appear here are from last year’s Ijtema and were taken from the
  electronic versions of newspapers such as <i>The Observer </i>and <i>The Daily
  Star</i>, and the AP.&nbsp; Most newspapers published from Dhaka are into this
  game of projecting the number of devotees that we endearingly call the <i>Musullis</i>.&nbsp;
  The number that we read in the newspapers for this year’s <i>Ijtema</i>
  ranged from 1 to 2 million for the first two days.&nbsp; The projection for
  the last day when <i>Akheri Munazat </i>or Final Supplication will be
  performed ranged anywhere between 2 to 3 million devotees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  This is true that Bangladesh’s Allah-fearing Muslims would cut corners by
  not attending the first two-days event and they will throng for the Ijtema
  ground en masse on Friday (December 15) to receive all the blessings from
  Allah by joining the <i>Akheri Munazat</i>.&nbsp; I personally think it is a
  charade of monumental proportion.</font>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim nation
  with about 88% of her people being Muslims.&nbsp; That would translate about
  114 million Muslims.&nbsp; Therefore, the ranking of Bangladesh would be the
  fourth largest nation to have Muslims after Indonesia, Pakistan, and India.&nbsp;
  Nonetheless, this nation does not behave like a Muslim <i>Ummah</i>
  (community) because in terms of corruption and crime it heads the list.&nbsp;
  If the people of Bangladesh had taken the religion Islam seriously, then the
  crime rate and the rampant corruption would be way down.&nbsp; Consequently,
  the nation would be spared from the shame of being known as the nation of
  thieves and unscrupulous office workers and politicians.&nbsp; Therefore,
  going to <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i> to receive blessing from Allah for <i>Akherat </i>or
  afterworld does not make any sense.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; That is the sole
  reason why this scribe thinks that we should label the event simply as a
  charade.</font>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Most newspapers has written that this is
  the 38th year running of <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i>, the one Bangladesh’s Tablig
  Al Jamaat had been hosting year after year.&nbsp; This is true.&nbsp; While we
  were attending high schools in early sixties, we were aware that in Ramna’s <i>Kakrail
  Mosque</i> some religious minded folks from all 17 districts of erstwhile East
  Pakistan used to gather in the drier winter months to listen to reputed
  Maulanas from <i>Deoband</i> and other reputed madrassahs.&nbsp; They would
  participate in <i>Tafsir</i>, <i>Boyan</i>, etc., to know the inner meaning of
  certain suras.&nbsp; To my knowledge, this event was so small that even the
  newspaper in those days would hardly paid any attention to the gatherings of
  scant Musullis in Kakrail Mosque.&nbsp; However, <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i> has come
  a long way since those days of early sixties.&nbsp; The Saudi influence was
  there but no one really noticed in the early days.&nbsp; The Ijtema program
  was becoming bigger and bigger going into the seventies.&nbsp; Finally, the
  venue was shifted from Kakrail Mosque to Tongi, which is about 10 miles to the
  north of Dhaka.&nbsp; In the late seventies, the movement got a shot in the
  arm by the blessings of Bangladesh’s military government.&nbsp; This scribe
  used to visit Bangladesh very frequently in the winter months in those years.&nbsp;
  The memory of busload of people going to Tongi on <i>Ijtema </i>day is still
  fresh in my mind.&nbsp; The evening TV news used to show a “pious” Gen.
  Ziaur Rahman sitting in the front row sporting his Rayban glass and looking
  very somber.&nbsp; Later, the other charlatan General who ruled Bangladesh
  with an iron grip also used to be a permanent fixture at the <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i>.&nbsp;
  Everyone played the game of charade while the masses gullibly thought the
  military Generals were <i>pucca</i> Muslims.&nbsp; We now know better-- what
  they were.&nbsp; Even the military dictators from Pakistani days such as Gen.
  Ayub Khan and Gen. Yahya Khan used to mingle with the clergies to project an
  image that is in line with Islam notwithstanding the fact that Ayub Khan was
  linked with Miss Christine Keller, a high society call girl, and Yahya Khan
  being known as a boozer.&nbsp; However, our simple-minded mullahs were not
  aware of the dark side of the Generals’ character.&nbsp; The mullahs are a
  subservient class who salute only power.&nbsp; During our 9-month long
  Liberation War in 1971 the same clergies sided with Tikka Khan.&nbsp; These
  are facts and verifiable.</font>

  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">In the 1990s, money was pouring like
  torrential rain.&nbsp; All the spigots of petro-dollars were turned fully.&nbsp;
  The foreign currency from Middle East was finding their ways to come to Ijtema
  ground.&nbsp; More and more people were coming in greater number.&nbsp; At one
  time, the Tablig Al Jamaat used to host the program for five long days.&nbsp;
  The <i>Musullis</i>, however, used to cut corners.&nbsp; Therefore, to boost
  attendance, the Ijtema committee shortened the entire program squeezing it
  into three days.&nbsp; This is encouraging development.&nbsp; Because in the
  past, the entire week in which Ijtema used to be hosted the government would
  shut down because of attendance problem; the business used to suffer and the
  life in entire Dhaka city and the outlying areas used to come to a standstill
  because of Ijtema.</font>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Now let us focus to the sociopolitical side
  of the story.&nbsp; This event of <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i> has become so big that
  politicians of all color would head towards <i>Ijtema</i> ground.&nbsp; The
  last big part – The <i>Akheri Munazat </i>– became so popular that most
  politicians would go to the <i>Ijtema</i> ground to be a part of it.&nbsp; In
  Islam, women are barred from going to mosque, but women in Bangladesh are not
  paying attention to scriptural dictum.&nbsp; The Tablig Movement is also
  encouraging Bangladesh’s women to take part in religious revival movement.&nbsp;
  This scribe remembers very vividly reading in the Internet news dailies from
  Dhaka that in the year 2001, both the seating PM Hasina Wazed and the leader
  of the opposition Mrs. Khaleda Zia had attended the <i>Akheri Munazat</i>.&nbsp;
  The only person who did not attend the ceremony in that year was the
  ex-president Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed.&nbsp; The Tablig Al Jamaat was very
  upset about it, though.&nbsp; We know that the present president Dr. Yazuddin
  Ahmed is a religious person; therefore, we may see a photo of the VIP tent in
  which the president of Bangladesh will seat in the front row.&nbsp; In all
  likelihood, we will see the photos of two <i>Prima Donnas</i> of Bangladesh
  politics offering their <i>Munazat</i> on the final day.&nbsp; This is for
  sure.&nbsp; Think for a moment if you hear the news that President Bush or the
  British PM Tony Blair had gone to attend a religious ceremony for two days.&nbsp;
  How hilarious it may sound.&nbsp; However, for Bangladesh, it is a different
  story altogether.&nbsp; The press and public alike would frown if the PM or
  the President stays away from <i>Ijtema</i> ground.</font>

  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Now that we are doing a short commentary on
  Bishwa Ijtema, we should be asking the following questions: What has happened
  to this tiny nation of Bangladesh?&nbsp; Why does the nation of Bangladesh
  have become so religious-minded?&nbsp; Unlike other nations in the world those
  who are marching forward to the drumbeats of science, technology, and good
  sense, Bangladesh along with Pakistan is heading back.&nbsp; Our journey is
  always in the backward direction.&nbsp; Our newspaper gloats over the
  projection that 1-2 million devotees would join the Ijtema on the first two
  days and the number would balloon to an astounding 2.5 to 3 million on the
  last day.&nbsp; The newspaper reports and some editorial write-ups will be
  putting so much emphasis to this number game that they think participation in
  such religious meeting that promotes revivalism and fundamentalism is the
  ultimate event at this time.&nbsp; One would expect that the erudite editors
  of Dhaka would write more editorials on how to cope up in this worldwide
  recessionary environment and how to improve the productivity of our work force
  given that opportunities for export-oriented business are next to nothing.&nbsp;
  However, these days, most newspapers will be filling their editorial page with
  the inane running commentaries of this <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i>, which could make
  some freethinkers' head reel.</font>
  <p><font size="+1" face="Garamond">Most government and semi-government news
  organizations such as UNB or BSS proudly would report that the number of
  devotees would swell this year over 2,5 million.&nbsp; However, they are quick
  to point out that this is second largest Islamic congregation (only second to
  Hajj ceremony).&nbsp; Last year I visited an official website of Saudi
  government.&nbsp; They reported that about 1.7 million Muslims have attended
  the Hajj ceremony.&nbsp; Therefore, it is quite wrong to say that Tongi’s
  Ijtema is only second next to Hajj ceremony in terms of number of Muslims
  attending a religious gathering.&nbsp; The math never lies.&nbsp; Therefore,
  if 2.5 million Bangalees are attending the Ijtema venue on the first two days
  and an estimated 4 million will be taking part on the day of Akheri Munazat,
  then clearly, the Bishwa Ijtema had eclipsed the Hajj ceremony not for the
  significance but by attendance.&nbsp; Nevertheless, not a single publication
  from Bangladesh will ever come out and say that Bangladesh’s Bishwa Ijtema
  is number one religious congregation in the Muslim world and the number of
  attendees has clearly surpassed the Hajj ceremony that is revered by most
  Muslims on earth.</font>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1" face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font> <img border="0" src="Ijtema_5.jpg" width="397" height="289">&nbsp;<center><b><font size="+1" color="#000099" face="Garamond"><br>
  The tired <i>Musullis</i> taking siesta after <i>Johr's </i>prayer</font></b></center>&nbsp;
  <p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Garamond">Aside from
  this number game, what else is so odd about this Ijtema?&nbsp; First, no
  Muslim holy books or holy man had ever preached that <i>Ijtema </i>in Tongi is
  a must religious event to be attended by all able-bodied Muslims.&nbsp;
  Second, unlike the basic teachings of Islam that promotes egalitarianism, the <i>Bishwa
  Ijtema</i> promotes separation of people based on money and status.&nbsp;
  Therefore, the Tablig Al Jamaat authorities have erected separate tents for
  foreign delegates and for government bureaucrats and politicians.&nbsp; The
  ordinary folks have no way of getting into these tents. Is that what Islam
  preaches?</font></p>
  <p><font size="+1" color="#000000" face="Garamond">The other odd thing about
  our <i>Musullis</i> is that there is no lasting impression of the messages
  that are being delivered at the <i>Ijtema</i> ground.&nbsp; The government
  officials will forget the teachings of Islam by the time they would return to
  Dhaka -- a journey of hardly an hour or two.&nbsp; They will practice
  assiduously the art of bribe-taking no sooner they enter their offices.&nbsp;
  Therefore, what is the importance of attending <i>Bishwa Ijtema</i>?&nbsp; Of
  all things our folks in Bangladesh need more of self-control.&nbsp; Unless and
  until they could achieve this, all this hard praying at the <i>Ijtema </i>ground
  for three long days and being blessed by the supplication of <i>Akheri Munazat
  </i>will turn up to be a great game of charade.&nbsp; Now, do we need this
  charade to continue?&nbsp; Our folks in Bangladesh should learn to be a human
  being first.&nbsp; The religiosity will automatically follow then.</font><br>
