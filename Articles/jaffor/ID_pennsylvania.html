	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A small Reuters news item in Yahoo 
	portal drew my attention on October 12, 2005. According to the news, a 
	Harvard professor by the name Brian Alters, who was brought as an expert 
	witness by the defense counsel slammed the teaching of 'Intelligent Design' 
	as a blow to science education as he testified in the lawsuit over whether 
	the creationists' theory should be taught in the school as an alternative to 
	scientific theory of evolution as propounded by Charles Darwin in mid 
	nineteenth century. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The trial, Kitzmiller versus Dover 
	Area School District (defendant) is being set in Harrisburg, the capital of 
	Pennsylvania. For those of the readers who do not know what 'Intelligent 
	Design' or ID is here is a primer. British Naturalist, Charles Darwin, 
	proposed in 1859 in his seminal book “Origin of Species” a scientific theory 
	of evolution, which ran counter to Biblical (and Koranic too!) account of 
	origin of species (including human being). Many theologians (Christians) 
	critiqued Darwin’s Theory of Evolution soon after the theory was propounded. 
	It has been about 146 years since Darwin wrote about scientific basis of 
	speciation, but Christian scholars vigorously defended the Creationist view 
	(the Biblical view or The Book of Genesis). As scientists unlocked the 
	mystery of gene in mid twentieth century, when the structure of ‘Double 
	Helix’ was elucidated by Watson and Crick, the Christian scholars came up 
	with this idea of ‘Intelligent design’ to challenge the scientific theory of 
	Darwin. They want the ID to be a part of science curriculum. This raise a 
	eyebrow amongst scientific communities allover the U.S. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Intelligent Design theory is a 
	fertile invention of Christian scholars. They say that organism’s complexity 
	is the evidence for the existence of a cosmic designer or the God. The idea 
	that an organism’s complexity is evidence for the existence of a supreme 
	being (God) cosmic was advanced a long time before Charles Darwin was born. 
	Its exponent was English theologian William Paley, who first described 
	creator of the famous watchmaker analogy. According to Perry, who wrote in 
	1802, if we find a pocket watch in a field, we immediately infer that it was 
	produced not by natural processes acting blindly but by a designing human 
	intellect. Similarly, he reasoned, the natural world contains abundant 
	evidence of a supernatural creator (God). The argument from design, as it is 
	known, prevailed as an explanation of the natural world until the 
	publication of the “Origin of Species in 1859.” The weight of the evidence 
	that Darwin had patiently gathered convinced scientists that evolution by 
	natural selection better explained life’s complexity and diversity. At the 
	end Darwin wrote in 1869, “I cannot possibly believe that a false theory 
	would explain so many classes of facts.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Christian theologists found some 
	scholars to rally around the ‘Intelligent Design’ (ID) theory. Some of them 
	say that an organism's eye is too sophisticated and complex to have evolved 
	by point mutations. The views of religionists were reflected in ID theory. 
	Thus, many religionists proposed that schools should teach Intelligent 
	Design side-by-side with Charles Darwin's scientific theory of evolution.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many rural American school districts 
	follow books in which one may find few paragraphs on ID design. One such 
	school district is in Dover, Pennsylvania. There, a parent sued the school 
	district authorities to exclude ID theory from the science book. The present 
	case is all about this exclusion. Of ID theory, the Harvard and McGill 
	professor, Brian Alters, said, “Probably the worst thing I have ever heard 
	of in science education.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The federal court trial over 
	teaching theories of human origins in U.S. schools pits Christian 
	conservatives, who say nature is so complex it must have been the work of a 
	God-like creator, (the ID Theory) against teachers and scientists who back 
	the scientific theory of evolution as proposed by Charles Darwin. This is 
	not the first time that the U.S. court has experienced a lawsuit in which 
	conservative Christians have gone after Darwinists. The present case in 
	Dover, Pennsylvania, seen as a major test of the issue, has echoes of the 
	famed &quot;Scopes Monkey trial&quot; of 1925 when lawyers argued in a Tennessee 
	courthouse over the teaching of Darwin's work. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the present case, in 
	Dover schools, ninth-grade biology students are given a four-paragraph 
	statement suggesting intelligent design (ID) as a viable alternative to 
	evolution and steering them to a book explaining the theory. The district 
	says the policy does not amount to teaching religion. However, the 11 
	parents bringing the federal lawsuit say the policy is religiously based and 
	illegal because it violates the U.S. Constitution's separation of church 
	(religion) and state. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Professor Alters testified the 
	statement amounted to teaching because it was an integral part of the 
	learning process and that teaching the theory may force students to choose 
	between God and science. Prof. Alters told the court, “Evolution does not 
	deny the existence of God. It's not about God. You can play the game of 
	science and still have your religious beliefs.” He warned that high school 
	students who were taught ID theory may suffer a loss of credibility in 
	college academics by mixing theology and science. He further cautioned the 
	court by saying that the inclusion of ID theory engenders misconceptions not 
	only about evolution but also about the whole process of science. In other 
	words the textbook should only discuss Darwin's scientific basis of theory 
	of evolution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In America, there is a growing 
	movement of conservatism. The presidential election of 2004 speaks in volume 
	this growing trend. Professor Alters cited a recent survey by the 
	50,000-member National Science Teachers Association showing that 31 percent 
	of its members reported being under pressure to teach creationism or other 
	nonscientific beliefs in science classes. This movement to include 
	creationist view side-by-side with scientific theory of evolution is also 
	growing so much so that in at least 30 U.S. states, proponents of 
	intelligent design (ID) are trying to introduce it into classrooms through 
	school boards, state education standards or state legislation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Reuters news, the trial 
	in Dover, Pennsylvania, is in its third week and is expected to last into 
	November 2005. The defense is expected to begin presenting its case on 
	October 17, 2005. It will be interesting to read what the religionists would 
	have to say in defense of ID. More liberal parents would file cases in the 
	Federal Court in other parts of the U.S. where the school board under 
	pressure from “Moral Majority” is incorporating ID theory as a part of 
	scientific basis of evolution. Therefore, stay tuned because more is yet to 
	come on ID theory, which is masquerading as a bona-fide scientific theory of 
	evolution. </font><br>
