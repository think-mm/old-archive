			<div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bright and early on 
				March 11, 2006, we learned that the prime architect of genocide 
				in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, Slobodan Milosevic, passed away 
				in custody while a trail was being conducted by the tribunal at 
				The Hague since 2002. The charges were serious. In a few months 
				time, Milosevic could have received a verdict of guilty for 
				committing crime against humanity. But that did not happen. The 
				ex-president of Serbia was chronically ill with heart ailment 
				and hypertension. His family asked the tribunal to send him to 
				Russia for treatment but the request was declined. Consequently, 
				before a judgment could be handed down to him, he passed away. 
				And along with it, a dark chapter of human history will remain 
				closed at least for the time being. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why should the world be 
				so concerned with the news of his passing away now that the 
				condemned Serbian politician awaited a trail at The Hague? Lest 
				we forget, Slobodan Milosevic was the villain whose meteoric 
				rise to power in Serbia in late 1980s and early 1990s had 
				changed the course of history of Balkans as Russian Empire in 
				Eastern Europe came crumbling down at that time. Influenced by 
				the rhetoric from Serbian president, Milosevic, Bosnian Serbs 
				planned to massacre Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995. Under the 
				growing world opinion against the Bosnian genocide, the NATO 
				ordered air strikes against Bosnian Serbs; only then did 
				Milosevic join the presidents of Bosnia and Croatia in peace 
				agreement at US-sponsored talks at Dayton, Ohio. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Milosevic was no 
				ordinary Serbian politician. Yugoslavia broke up into 7 smaller 
				nations, namely, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, 
				Montenegro, Macedonia, when he was at the helm in Belgrade. It 
				was a difficult and turbulent time for the people Balkans. Add 
				to this misery, the genocide against Kosovo’s Albanians and 
				Bosnia’s Muslims. You get the picture—an ugly one. Many 
				political observers at the time thought that Serbians did the 
				killing in Kosovo and Bosnia while Russians tacitly approved the 
				killing. Moscow could have exerted its influence by telling 
				Milosevic to stop the genocide. However, that did not happen. 
				Because of the negligence of the West and Russia many innocent 
				lives were lost in the hands of Serbian soldiers. Should 
				Milosevic be blamed for all the killings? Let the experts speak 
				on the issue. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is appropriate here 
				to discuss the rise and fall of Slobodan Milosevic now that he 
				has gone to the other world. His name will certainly go down in 
				the history as the person under whose leadership a full-scale 
				genocide was perpetrated by Serbs in Kosovo and Bosnia. The term 
				“ethnic cleansing” was coined to highlight the plights of 
				Kosovo’s Albanian majority and Bosnian-Herzegovina’s Muslims. We 
				learn from history textbook that Serbs moved to these areas 
				during seventh century. The ethnic strife had existed in these 
				two provinces for a long time. The breakup of Yugoslavia in late 
				1980s and early 1990s ignited the pre-existing ethnic feud to a 
				new height. President Milosevic acted as a catalyst to reignite 
				the ethnic hatred that lead to a full-scale genocide in Kosovo 
				and Bosnia-Herzegovina. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The twentieth century 
				should go down in the history as the time when much genocide was 
				perpetrated. To name a few, I would list the following: 1. The 
				Armenian genocide (done by Turks from 1908-1912); 2. The Russian 
				genocide (done against Russian Gypsies and political dissidents 
				by Joseph Stalin’s army in 1930s and 1940s); 3. The Holocaust 
				(done by Hitler’s army against the Jews in Europe from 
				1939-1945); 4. The Bangladesh genocide (done by Pakistani army 
				against Bengalis in 1971); 5. The Chilean genocide (done by 
				Chilean military against socialists under the leadership of Gen. 
				Augusto Pinochet from 1973-1978); 6. The Cambodian genocide 
				(done by the Pol Pot regime during 1975 through 1979); 7. The 
				Rwandan genocide (done by Hutu against Tutsi in mid 1990s); 8. 
				The Kosovo-Bosnia genocide (done by Serbs against ethnic 
				Albanians in Kosovo and Bosnian Muslims in 1990s); 9. The 
				Kurdish genocide (done in early 1990s by Saddam’s army against 
				Kurdish people of Iraq); 10. The Darfur genocide (done by 
				Sudanese militia against indigenous African tribal people in 
				2003 through now). </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The life of ex-Serbian 
				president Slobodan Milosevic should be analyzed to understand 
				why the certain unstable parts of the world fall victim to 
				ethnic strife that eventually leads to genocide or democide, a 
				term coined by Prof. Rummel, to denote “the murder of any person 
				or people by a government, including genocide, politicide, and 
				mass murder.” By analyzing genocides of recent time one could 
				certainly find a villain who is a megalomaniac of sort directing 
				the killing of mostly innocent people. History is not kind to 
				these people. A short list of such villainous leader would be 
				Joseph Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse-tung, Gen. Yahya Khan, Gen. 
				Augusto Pinochet, Saddam Hussein, and Slobodan Milosevic. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Slobodan Milosevic rode 
				a wave of nationalistic fervor as the Balkan wars erupted in 
				late 1980s. In 1987, Milosevic's popularity skyrocketed in 
				Serbia as he defends protesters from allegedly being beaten by 
				predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo police. In 1988, after 
				purging Serbian Communist Party and media he ousted Serbian 
				state President Ivan Stambolic. He promoted Serbian nationalism 
				and was elected president in Serbia’s first multi-party election 
				since World War II. In 1991, Yugoslavia, the union of Balkans 
				states, started to disintegrate; Croatia and Slovenia proclaim 
				independence. In Bosnia, Muslims and Croats vote for 
				independence in referendum boycotted by Serbs. The EU recognizes 
				Bosnia’s independence; consequently, war breaks out between 
				Bosnian government and local Serbs, who start 1992-1995 siege of 
				capital Sarajevo. In 1993, Bosnia peace efforts failed, war 
				breaks out between Muslims and Croats, previously allied against 
				Serbs. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1995, the NATO air 
				strikes against Bosnian Serbs were started thus forcing 
				Milosevic to join the presidents of Bosnia and Croatia in peace 
				agreement at US-sponsored talks at Dayton, Ohio. A year later 
				Serbian opposition supporters, accusing government of election 
				fraud, marched in Belgrade in a campaign to oust Milosevic. 
				Still then, in 1997, Milosevic was elected Yugoslav president by 
				federal parliament after junior federation partner Montenegro 
				thwarts his plans for popular ballot. Milosevic steps down as 
				Serbian president after serving maximum two terms. Political 
				problem still continued in Kosovo until 1999. The NATO planes 
				started the second round of bombing in 1999 to end Serbs-led 
				ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and other war-torn places in former 
				Yugoslavia. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1999, the UN war 
				crimes tribunal confirms it has indicted Milosevic as war 
				criminal. In 2000, Milosevic sets presidential, parliamentary 
				and local elections for September 24. A lack of transparency 
				marred the election. The opposition began campaign of strikes 
				and civil disobedience to force Milosevic to step down. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2001, Serbian 
				Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic placed the ex-president under 
				round-the-clock police surveillance. He was arrested after a 
				36-hour stand off. Milosevic pleads not guilty to charges of 
				diverting state funds and is remanded in custody for a 30-day 
				investigation period. In the meantime, the UN chief prosecutor 
				Carla del Ponte says she has prepared a second arrest warrant 
				for Milosevic on charges of war crimes in Bosnia. The Serbian 
				government did not hand over Milosevic to the U.N. official who 
				wanted to bring him to The Hague International tribunal. 
				Finally, under Western pressure ahead of a June 29, 2001, 
				donors’ conference, reformist ministers in the Yugoslav 
				government pushes through decree paving way for the transfer of 
				war crimes suspects such as Milosevic to the UN tribunal. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2002, Milosevic goes 
				on trial charged with 66 counts of genocide, crimes against 
				humanity and war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo. On top of 
				it, the Croatian President Stjepan Mesic accuses Milosevic of 
				engineering the breakup of Yugoslavia and using the army to 
				seize Croat land in his pursuit of a Greater Serbia. The 
				tribunal at The Hague was slow; it took 2 years for the 
				prosecutors to call 290 witnesses before they could rest their 
				case against Milosevic. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As expected, Milosevic 
				launches his defense case, branding his war crimes trial a 
				“distortion of history” and he blamed the West for fuelling 
				Yugoslavia’s eventual collapse. Milosevic wins back right to 
				lead his own defense on appeal after the tribunal appointed 
				lawyers to run his case to prevent delays due to his ill health. 
				In his defense, Former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
				tells court Milosevic was a peacemaker who did not want to fight 
				for a &quot;Greater Serbia&quot;, while an anti-Serb West stoked the 
				bloody collapse of Yugoslavia. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2005, prosecutors 
				show court a video of Serb paramilitary soldiers murdering six 
				Bosnian Muslim youths near Srebrenica (Bosnia). For a speedy 
				trial, the tribunal decided against splitting off the indictment 
				on the 1999 Kosovo conflict so that part of the trial can be 
				concluded. This year, the tribunal rejected Milosevic’s request 
				to travel to Russia for specialist medical treatment. Milosevic 
				said he would appeal against the decision, saying his health was 
				worsening. He died on March 11, 2006. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Milosevic was a complex 
				politician who came into the forefront of politics in former 
				Yugoslavia as the country was preparing for eventual implosion 
				and dismemberment. He had a dream to keep the provinces under 
				“Greater Serbia” wherever Serbs lived. Thus, Serbia wanted to 
				keep part of Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina to make it 
				possible for a “Greater Serbia” after the demise of Yugoslavia. 
				Interestingly, Russia had given their approval to Milosevic’s 
				proposal. Sadly, as Serbian soldiers perpetrated genocide in 
				Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia remained silent 
				as the ethnic cleansing flared up in these provinces of former 
				Yugoslavia. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is a great loss for 
				the world as the International Tribune in the Netherlands failed 
				to bring a judgment against Slobodan Milosevic. Empowered with 
				fervor of ultra nationalism, the Serbs perpetrated ethnic 
				cleansing under the leadership of Slobodan Milosevic. He was 
				brought to trial at The Hague tribunal for war crime but due to 
				complex nature of the case against Milosevic the accused died 
				before a verdict come from the judge. Even a symbolic punishment 
				could have done the justice. The world never saw a repentant 
				Milosevic. A megalomaniac of his stature never does see the 
				world from the perspective of an ordinary human being. Or else, 
				he would have seen the vile nature of actions by Serbian 
				soldiers against innocent Kosovo, Bosnians, and Croats, 
				tantamount to crime against humanity. Milosevic’s mind was 
				clouded with ultra-nationalism; thus, he thought that 
				materialization of his dreamland “the Greater Serbia” is more 
				important than tens and thousands of ethnic Bosnians and Kosovo 
				lives. Throughout the trial, he thumbed his nose by pointing out 
				that he had a sacred mission to serve the interest of his 
				people. No wonder, ultra nationalism is a potent opiate that 
				could cloud a normal human mind. It is too bad that Slobodan 
				Milosevic did not quite understand the disease that afflicted 
				his mind.</font></div>
