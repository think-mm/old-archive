  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How would you like 
  to remember the departing year 2004?&nbsp; As the eventful year is winding down 
  very fast, it is a time to reflect back all the good things that happened this 
  year and bad things that plagued the blue planet of ours.&nbsp; Apart from the 
  election in Afghanistan and the handover of governance to Iraqis by America in 
  the middle of the year, I cannot think of any good thing that I will remember 
  further down the road.&nbsp; Yes, we had quite a few elections that took place in 
  different democracies round the world with contrasting results.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In May 2004, 
  Indians went to polling place in droves to oust the Hindu fundamentalist 
  government of Atal Behari Vajpayee to reinstitute the secular party Congress 
  at the helm.&nbsp; On November 2, we witnessed a tightly contested race in 
  America.&nbsp; Even though John Kerry had received more votes – percentage wise – 
  than Bill Clinton or any other Democrats in recent times, he lost to a 
  warmongering president who represents the conservatives in America.&nbsp; Then in 
  November 21, the Ukrainians went to poll to elect their new president.&nbsp; This 
  election according to many observers were rigged a big time favoring a Putin-backed 
  candidate, which led to a popular revolt dubbed as “Orange Revolution.”&nbsp; The 
  rigged election results were annulled setting the stage for a new election on 
  December 26.&nbsp; Ukrainians on that day will make history to set the record 
  right.&nbsp; Of course, these are the marvels of a democratic nation.&nbsp; What did 
  happen to Ukraine vis-à-vis the “Orange Revolution” is unthinkable during the 
  Soviet days.&nbsp; The New World Order that became a catchphrase after 1991 
  dismantling of the Old Russian Empire (sarcastically put, though) is like a 
  bonanza for freedom-loving people.&nbsp; Former Soviet democracies could boast 
  having many rich oligarchs.&nbsp; Indeed, a Ukrainian colleague of mine told me 
  that both Viktor Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych are part of this newly 
  formed oligarchic system.&nbsp; It is a power play between two groups of 
  oligarchs.&nbsp; The common people however think that they are fighting for a 
  cause.&nbsp; Politicians indeed have a way with their people.&nbsp; They know what to 
  say to their people to give the impression that they are fighting for a vause.&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. George Bush’s 
  war effort in Iraq did not go the way Pentagon planners wanted; instead, the 
  insurgency reared its ugly head causing many deaths and destruction.&nbsp; The 
  largest single day casualty happens to take place on December 21 killing 22 
  men in a mess in northern city Mosul; most of them were U.S. soldiers.&nbsp; Mr. 
  Rumsfeld, U.S. defense secretary, went to Iraq for boosting the morale of 
  American soldiers only to find that insurgents detonating yet another bomb 
  minutes after Secretary Rumsfeld had left Baghdad airport.&nbsp; The bottom line is 
  that insurgencies had grown by leaps and bounds in Iraq and one may thank Mr. 
  Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld profusely for this nasty development.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The two nations that 
  played the game ‘hide and go seek’ throughout the year were North Korea 
  (infant terrible) and Iran (Mullah’s paradise).&nbsp; Pyongyang’s neighbors and 
  America had arranged not one but two meetings (Beijing Two and Beijing Three) 
  one in February and the other in June 2004 to pacify that rogue nation from 
  blasting its nuke it clams to have possessed; the meetings went nowhere and 
  threats still linger.&nbsp; The Mullahs in Iran gave conflicting signals to IAEA 
  and the world.&nbsp; Iran claims to have gas centrifuges for enrichment of uranium, 
  which is obligatory in nuke making.&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Early in January 
  2004, the architect of Pakistan’s Islamic Atom bomb, Dr. Abdul Qader Khan, and 
  one of his top aids, General Mirza Aslam Beg, was in proverbial political hot 
  water.&nbsp; Mr. Khan and his military aid, Gen. M. Aslam Beg were about to be 
  prosecuted under Pakistan ‘Official Secrets Act’ when that nation’s 
  investigators unearthed some very damaging evidences that point out the duo’s 
  involvement in selling nuclear secrets to Iran during 1980s.&nbsp; Nonetheless, 
  Gen. Musharraf pardoned Dr. Khan in an emotional televised speech for the fear 
  that the entire military establishment in Pakistan might be dragged into this 
  fiasco.&nbsp; During the debates between Bush and Kerry in September and October 
  2004, Mr. Bush wrongly said that A.Q. Khan was brought to justice.&nbsp; But you 
  know what?&nbsp; No news network or print newspaper that I know of took Mr. Bush to 
  task for his wrong assertion.&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some civil rights 
  group had unearthed the news of the genocide of indigenous Sudanese people in 
  Darfur region early in the year; however, no major nations took any actions 
  before an estimated twenty to thirty thousand people had vanished into the 
  thin air.&nbsp; The U.S. finally took an interest in Darfur massacre.&nbsp; It seems as 
  if the Khartoum Administration was playing games with the lives of the 
  indigenous people in western Sudan as ‘Janjawid’ horsemen wreaked havoc by 
  burning villages, raping women, and killing able-bodied men.&nbsp; It is heartening 
  to know that because of too much publicity in the news another Rwanda was 
  averted.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Osama bin Laden and 
  his “fine” organization were in the news throughout 2004.&nbsp; Thanks to al-Jazeerah 
  television network for a “fine job” they are doing.&nbsp; The terror organization, 
  al-Qaeda, and their partner from North African states had successfully bombed 
  some train compartments on March 11, 2004 resulting in the deaths of 190 
  people and worse influencing the national election in Spain.&nbsp; Both Mr. bin 
  Laden and his trusted lieutenant, Dr. Ayman <span style="color: black">al-Zawahiri 
  had sent either audio or videotaped message to al-Jazeerah in which both of 
  the terrorist leaders have given empty threats to America.&nbsp; Mr. bin Laden’s 
  videotaped message was released in late October right before the U.S. 
  election.&nbsp; That action of Mr. bin Laden may have strengthened Mr. Bush’s 
  candidacy.&nbsp; However, in all honesty, both Mr. Bush and bin Laden need each 
  other to cling to the catbird seat of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font>

  <span style="color: black">Mr. Putin’s Russia has seen a lot in 2004.&nbsp; The 
  presidential election was a big deal for Russians and Mr. Putin wanted to win 
  it by a big margin.&nbsp; He became way too much authoritarian as a president.&nbsp; He 
  jailed a few oligarchs who became very rich by buying state-run petroleum 
  companies at low low price during the heydays of President Boris Yeltsin when 
  the fever of free market economy was running amuck allover Russia.&nbsp; The 
  Kremlin brought charges against billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Chairman 
  of oil giant Yukus and put him behind the bar in a place crammed with common 
  Moscow criminals because Khodorkovsky financed the election of a few 
  presidential aspirants to show his disdain for Mr. Vladimir Putin.&nbsp; A streak 
  of authoritarianism now runs in Mr. Putin’s presidency.&nbsp; Consequently, the oil 
  giant, Yukus, is now on the verge of bankruptcy.&nbsp; Will this deter foreign 
  investment in Russia?&nbsp; Yes, you had better believe it.&nbsp; Russians have endured 
  an assault on them by Chechen separatists who blasted bombs in a schoolyard 
  that killed hundreds of innocent victims.&nbsp; What a shame!&nbsp; </span></font></p>

  to improve their economy.&nbsp; The nation of Turkey just got the word out that EU 
  may let the nation in but after watching it for 10-15 years.&nbsp; The Saudis have 
  finally taken steps to curb fund raising activities by terrorists in the name 
  of charity.&nbsp; For example, al-Haramain, a well-known Muslim charity in Saudi 
  Arabia was banned because it was unearthed by America’s intelligence that the 
  charity was deeply involved in funding all kinds of terrorist outfits.&nbsp; For 
  this action and for being way too much loyal to America, terrorists have
