	<font size="4" face="Garamond">The chief of the military-backed government 
	of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>, Fakhruddin Ahmed, spoke before a gathering at the 
	campus of 
<ST1>Columbia University</ST1> on September 28, 2007.&nbsp; The chief advisor came to 
	New York City a few days earlier to attend the general assembly of the U.N. 
	in which he gave a 15-miniute address before the dignitaries and the 
	permanent representatives of the comity of nations that make this 
	organization one of a kind world body.<O></O></font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
	<font size="4" face="Garamond">Fakhruddin’s address to Columbia University’s 
	“World Leader’s Forum” caught the attention of many people because this is 
	the first time that the chief advisor came to the West after being thrust 
	into power by cantonment intrigue in Bangladesh.&nbsp; Also, the chief advisor 
	never did take any question from journalists in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
	despite the fact that he attended various state functions in many of which 
	he delivered only speech.&nbsp; <O></O></font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
	<font size="4" face="Garamond">The silent force that is the purveyor of 
	Fakhruddin Administration does not allow the chief advisor to address the 
	press in an open forum.&nbsp; That is precisely why quite a few eager beaver 
	attended the lecture with the hope that they could ask him some pertinent 
	questions about the way <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> is being run since January 12, 
	2007.&nbsp; Many civil rights activists also attended the lecture to get the 
	impression as to why about a quarter million people or so are rotting in the 
	jail without any charge, tens and thousands of poor people were made 
	homeless by the government’s forces alone in Dhaka, half a dozen senior 
	professors from three universities – Dhaka, Rajshahi, and Chittagong were 
	arrested and placed in jail as of this writing, and why the government had 
	arrested a twenty-year old cartoonists at the behest of Islamists in 
	Bangladesh.&nbsp; The other pressing questions that need explanation are – the 
	exit map for this temporary government whose 90-days tenure as per the 
	constitution had all but expired and how long the emergency rule will 
	continue in this “paradoxical” nation that is mired in hyper inflation, and 
	quasi military rule.&nbsp; Not to mention the military-backed government had 
	supported a faction of political leaders to engage in open politics when it 
	has squashed the political activities of the leading parties and whose 
	leaders are in jail pending litigation.&nbsp; Also important to many attendees of 
	the lecture is the issue of the up coming general election and the reform 
	process that should make a level playing field for all political parties.<O></O></font></span></p>

	<font size="4" face="Garamond">I could not attend the lecture because I live 
	about 1,300-1,400 miles away from New York City; however, Mr. Jahed Ahmed, 
	who is one of the moderators of Mukto-mona forum, had attended the meeting 
	and I read his eye account report of the speech.&nbsp; Mr. Ahmed did a 
	superlative job in reporting the performance of Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed while 
	he took notes.&nbsp; I request the readers
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jahed/English/Fakruddin_columbia.html">to 
	peruse his report</a> to know what Mr. Fakhruddin had emphasized in his

	<font size="4" face="Garamond">What I would like to do in this write-up is 
	to bring up the issue of one segment of his speech in which he said, 
	“Bangladesh is, in many ways, a paradox that has baffled many a pundit.”&nbsp; 
	This needs elaboration a bit.&nbsp; I have no idea in which context the chief 
	advisor categorized <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> as a paradoxical land.&nbsp; Is it the 
	polity, its political leadership, or is it the people?<O></O></font></span></p>

	<font size="4" face="Garamond">As I have alluded to earlier that Mr. 
	Fakhruddin Ahmed was thrust into the forefront of governance by a powerful 
	coterie of power.&nbsp; His purveyor – the military in my view is accountable for 
	making <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> a paradoxical land.&nbsp; In August 15, 1975 the 
	military executed a plan that it hatched in Kurmitola cantonment.&nbsp; Since 
	then the military came to power not once but three times.&nbsp; All along the 
	way, it courted the mullahs (read Islamists) to consolidate its power.&nbsp; Lest 
	we forget, this tiny nation was formed in 1971 through a mass participation 
	under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Tajuddin Ahmed, Nazrul Islam, 
	and many more like them.&nbsp; An estimated 3 million people were butchered and a 
	quarter million women raped by the brute and occupation army of Pakistani 
	government.&nbsp; The masses wanted a secular polity and they got one only to see 
	that only three and half-year later the military reverted the course of the 
	journey to transform this one-time vibrant society into a quasi religious 
	state.&nbsp; <O></O></font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
	<font size="4" face="Garamond">In mid-September 2007 a vernacular newspaper 
	published an innocuous cartoon in which the twenty-year old cartoonist by 
	the name Arifur Rahman poked a fun at the naming of Muslim boys.&nbsp; The 
	Islamists twisted the meaning of the punch line and asked the government to 
	arrest the cartoonist and the editor, publisher and the whole shebang of 
	Bangla newspaper <i>Prothom Alo</i>.&nbsp; The Fakhruddin Administration could 
	have appointed a body of scholars to look into the content of the carton 
	before arresting the cartoonist.&nbsp; But to appease the religious fanatics the 
	government did nothing of that sort and it simply arrested the young man who 
	created the cartoon.&nbsp; The activist government then went further and arranged 
	a “<i>Taoba</i>” (forgiveness or pardon) ceremony with the mullahs asking 
	the law minister to be the middle man to carry out the fiasco in public.&nbsp; 
	The picture of the hapless editor seated among corpulent mullahs graced the 
	page of most newspaper.&nbsp; The secular segment of the society simply cringed 
	in feat thinking what lies ahead for this “paradoxical” land.&nbsp; In my opinion 
	the military-led government is making this country a nation of paradox.<O></O></font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
	<font size="4" face="Garamond">The army appointed 10 or so technocrats, 
	ex-military men, and businessman to run the country of 150 million people 
	after January 11, 2007 over through of a caretaker government, which was 
	ordained in late October 2006.&nbsp; The country is essentially being run by a 
	group of oligarchs who have no connection to masses.&nbsp; <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
	is still a village-based polity.&nbsp; These men are all city-bred and have a 
	serious disconnection to the people of the land.&nbsp; The Fakhruddin 
	Administration’s main agenda was to break the tradition of two-family driven 
	politics but to do execute its policy it appointed three oligarchs from the 
	same family.&nbsp; Is not it paradoxical?&nbsp; The military-led government said it 
	will arrest all the corrupt politicians but in reality it turned a blind eye 
	to quite a few politicians who are corrupt.&nbsp; The only reason these corrupt 
	politicians are roaming freely in the nation is that they are extending 
	their helping hands to tighten the noose around the neck of two supreme 
	political leaders.&nbsp; The government is also dictating these corrupt but free 
	politicians to wreak havoc in their respective parties.&nbsp; Initially the 
	government thought they could help catapult Dr. Yunus into the political 
	arena.&nbsp; The Peace Nobel laureate thought he could facilely form a political 
	party using the Internet and media but that was proven so wrong.&nbsp; The idea 
	of forming the party just withered in the vine and the oligarchs could do 
	nothing but twiddle their thumbs.&nbsp; Indeed, <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> is 
	seemingly a nation of contradiction.<O></O></font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">
	<font size="4" face="Garamond">If I understand correctly by reading Jahed 
	Ahmed’s write-up on day’s event at <ST1>Columbia</ST1> <ST1>University</ST1>, 
	Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed talked about the success of poverty alleviation 
	program, food production situation in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> and the need for 
	good governance; however, he avoided those touchy issues as the arrest of 
	university professors and the young cartoonist.&nbsp; These questions were asked 
	but the chief advisor dodged the questions while he gave his glib answers.&nbsp; 
	I was saddened to hear that Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed did not even say word on 
	the arrest of Arifur Rahman, the jailed cartoonist.&nbsp; By remaining reticent 
	on this hot issue, the chief advisor had proved one more time that <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1> is riddled with contradiction in terms of the governance.&nbsp; 
	The same Mr. Fakhruddin had given a fiery speech on February 21, 2007 in 
	which he urged everyone to join in to make <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> a 
	knowledge-based society but that ephemeral plea just vanished in the thin 
	air.&nbsp; The hard reality is that the nation is now under the influence of 
	obscurantists who are dictating the government to efface the vestiges of 
	secularism.&nbsp; Isn’t that a glaring example of the paradoxical nature of <ST1>
	Bangladesh</ST1>?&nbsp; If I may say so, Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, it is through your 
	action our motherland is becoming not only a hapless but an utter 
	paradoxical land.&nbsp; Instead of lecturing on it, please do something about it 
	so that in future this epithet could be kept “rest in peace.”</font></span></font></div>
