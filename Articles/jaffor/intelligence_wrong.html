	&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 31, 2005, the presidential panel on ‘weapons of mass 
	destruction’ (WMD) published their overwrought report that is over 600-page 
	long in which it pointed out a colossal failure by the U.S. intelligence 
	(read CIA), which gave a blow to American credibility that will take years 
	to correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, the spymasters still know disturbingly very little about 
	nuclear programs in countries like Iran and North Korea.&nbsp; This is the 
	foregone conclusion of a presidential commission that comprises of two 
	distinguished U.S. citizens namely, retired Judge Laurence Silberman, a 
	Republican, and former Democratic Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia who is the 
	commission's co-chairmen.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; President Bush accepted the scathing criticism that came from the 
	panel while he praised the candor of the panel members’ comments.&nbsp; The 
	commission found failures throughout U.S. spy agencies that resulted in 
	botched estimates of the threat posed by Iraqi regime headed by Saddam 
	Hussein.&nbsp; The botched spy reports served as the basis for Bush’s 
	‘get-tough with Saddam’ policy, which ultimately resulted in the regime 
	change in Baghdad favored by not only President Bush but also by VP Dick 
	Cheney, Secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of Defense, 
	Paul Wolfowitz (now about to serve as the president of the World Bank), and 
	Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The commission recommended the overhauling of the intelligence 
	community to increase sharing among 15 agencies and foster dissenting views.&nbsp; 
	The former senator, Charles Robb, a panel member had opined that the U.S. 
	intelligence community was mired in a Cold War-mindset.&nbsp; While 
	addressing a news conference to mark the publication of the commission 
	report, Senator Robb quipped, “They are still, in some respects, fighting 
	the last war.”&nbsp; What Senator Robb meant by last war was the prolonged 
	Cold War that lasted from 1945 to 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; President Bush while he must have been embarrassed by the findings 
	of the panel said he agreed that fundamental change is needed and he 
	promised to “correct what needs to be fixed.”&nbsp; So serious was the 
	president that he directed White House homeland security adviser Fran 
	Townsend to lead a review of the findings over 90 days and oversee 
	corrections.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the panel report was out, major news agencies such as 
	Reuters, AP, etc., had covered the press conference and highlighted the 
	findings in the news reports that were published a day later on April 1, 
	2005.&nbsp; I have also read a couple of editorials and commentary that were 
	written hurriedly and published a day later in prestigious newspapers such 
	as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).&nbsp; Mr. Fred Iklé, a conservative writer 
	who served as the undersecretary of defense in the Reagan Administration, 
	wrote a commentary entitled “WMD Redux” in the WSJ’s editorial page on April 
	1, 2005.&nbsp; By the word “Redux,” he meant, “brought back,” or 
	“revisited.”&nbsp; It was an appropriate title, to say the least.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana">&nbsp; The commission report indeed brought back the 
	controversy of WMD vis-à-vis Iraq, which was the cornerstone of U.S. defense 
	policy in respect to Iraq in the year 2002.&nbsp; Because of the faulty 
	intelligence report, the trigger-happy hawks in the Bush Administration were 
	in the cloud nine to launch the unilateral invasion of Iraq in March 2003.&nbsp; 
	Needless to say, tens and thousands of innocent Iraqis were killed in the 
	invasion.&nbsp; The insurgencies that were engendered by the American 
	invasion also led to loss of Iraqi lives along with the death of American 
	soldiers that has far exceeded the estimation by the Pentagon.&nbsp; All of 
	these happened simply because of a massive intelligence failure by the CIA 
	and other agencies of the U.S. government.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Iklé being a conservative analyst did not like the seminal 
	findings of the commission on WMD.&nbsp; Thus, to mock the columnists who 
	are going to have a field day in coming days he wrote in his half scholarly 
	WSJ commentary as follows: “Equipped with a rearward telescope called 
	hindsight, hunting down other people’s mistakes is a fun sport – enjoyed by 
	policy wonks as well as the media.&nbsp; But prudence suggests we should 
	also have a forward-looking telescope to warn us of policy failures on the 
	road ahead.”&nbsp; Mr. Iklé called the critics of the Bush Administration 
	“wonks” – a derisive word for a student who studies excessively.&nbsp; Most 
	conservative analysts who side with president Bush on Iraq conveniently 
	forget that this flawed intelligence report had given the Pentagon planners 
	of the Iraq War and the White House the green light to drum up support in 
	the media to legitimize the invasion.&nbsp; I suppose the loss of human 
	lives means very little to Mr. Iklé and the likes of him.&nbsp; Instead of 
	giving a glowing encomium to the panel members of the WMD commission, the 
	conservative critics found ill intent amongst the critics of the Bush 
	Administration vis-à-vis the WMD fiasco concerning Saddam regime.&nbsp; When 
	President Bush has accepted the panel’s scathing report and recommendations, 
	then who are these conservative think-tank members?&nbsp; Mr. Iklé is 
	visibly upset as he penned his commentary to lambaste the liberal news 
	media.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The call for intelligence reform in the aftermath of Iraq invasion 
	when no evidence of weapons of mass destruction could be found in that 
	country came from Democrats but those initiatives to reform intelligence 
	gathering and analysis have not borne fruit.&nbsp; It remains to be seen 
	whether the Bush Administration will take the recommendations by the 
	bi-partisan commission seriously.&nbsp; The Oregon Democratic Senator Ron 
	Wyden, a member of the Senate select Committee on intelligence voiced his 
	concern as he said, “It concerns me that many of the commission's 
	recommendations have been made before, but the president failed to act.”&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The WMD commission report warned that John Negroponte, who was 
	recently nominated to be the new director of national intelligence, faces 
	turf battles with the CIA and Defense Department, which it called some of 
	the government’s “most headstrong agencies,” and predicted “they will try to 
	run around -- or over” him.&nbsp; The CIA Director Porter Goss, however, 
	promised to work with Negroponte to quickly make needed changes.&nbsp; Mr. 
	Goss said,&nbsp; “We need more robust collection and rigorous analysis.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The WMD commission sent Bush a separate letter criticizing overhaul 
	plans at the CIA and the FBI.&nbsp; The report says: “these agencies remain 
	too comfortable with a 'business as usual' approach to intelligence 
	gathering.”</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be mentioned here that Messrs. Bush and Dick Cheney 
	escaped direct blame for the flawed intelligence gathering even though their 
	critics say that the Bush Administration had exaggerating the intelligence 
	on Iraq to pursue a costly war with a deadly aftermath.&nbsp; In this 
	regard, the WMD report says, “The analysts who worked Iraqi weapons issues 
	universally agreed that in no instance did political pressure cause them to 
	skew or alter any of their analytical judgments.”&nbsp; However, the report 
	was quick to assert, “It is hard to deny the conclusion that intelligence 
	analysts worked in an environment that did not encourage skepticism about 
	the conventional wisdom.”</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is a vocal 
	critic of the president, urged the Senate intelligence committee to 
	investigate whether Bush administration officials misused intelligence.&nbsp; 
	The Democrats will try to keep the issue of intelligence failure under 
	President Bush to point out to the Americans that the president’s inner 
	circle especially the VP (Dick Cheney), Defense Secretary (Rumsfeld), Deputy 
	Defense Secretary (Paul Wolfowitz), and Security Advisor (Condoleezza Rice) 
	were very eager to tell advise the president that a regime change was 
	necessary in Iraq to avert a catastrophe looming because of stockpiling of 
	WMD by Saddam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The WMD commission report has a chapter on alleged nuclear weapons 
	programs in Iran and North Korea.&nbsp; However, it was classified; 
	therefore, not released publicly.&nbsp; The Reuters report mentioned that 
	sources familiar with that section said it was among the most critical, 
	finding U.S. intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program particularly inadequate.&nbsp; 
	The most scathing remarks made by the commission point fingers at the CIA, 
	Defense Intelligence Agency and other agencies for producing “worthless or 
	misleading” intelligence on Iraq before a war fought over claims that Saddam 
	Hussein had amassed weapons of mass destruction, none of which was found 
	however.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In what amounted to a direct charge on George Tenet, who was CIA 
	director before the Iraq war and who gave the president his daily 
	intelligence briefing, the commission found that “the daily reports sent to 
	the president and senior policymakers discussing Iraq over many months 
	proved to be disastrously one-sided.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Mr. Tenet said in his defense, “American intelligence was 
	nearly in (a) Chapter 11 bankruptcy” by the mid-to-late 1990s, and that he 
	had implemented a rebuilding program that was still in progress as the Iraq 
	threat was examined.&nbsp; This was reported in a Reuter’s write-up on April 
	1, 2005.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The WMD commission recommended the creation of a national counter 
	proliferation center to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction and 
	a separate National Security Service within the FBI.&nbsp; Whether the Bush 
	Administration will consider these recommendations remains to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the bipartisan commission on WMD had published their 
	findings and recommendations on March 31, 2005.&nbsp; In the report was 
	included some scathing criticism of intelligence organizations and how they 
	gather and analyze intelligence.&nbsp; The Bush Administration used this 
	bogus analysis to formulate a plan to invade Iraq and they even tried to 
	drum up support amongst allies in Europe.&nbsp; The war cost America 
	hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention the loss of lives – both 
	Iraqis and Americans.&nbsp; Will the recommendations made by the commission 
	to overhaul the intelligence department be taken seriously?&nbsp; We have to 
	wait on this as Mr. John Negroponte assumes the office of the chief of 
	national intelligence.&nbsp; In the next decade, the Americans will witness 
	a debate over how the CIA and other intelligence agencies gather and analyze 
	sensitive information.&nbsp; The Iraqi WMD fiasco that put the U.S. in 
	collision course with Saddam will serve as an example of how flawed 
	intelligence could disturb peace and prosperity of our otherwise a tranquil 
	world.&nbsp;<br>
