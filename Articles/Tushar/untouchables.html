				<font face="Verdana">More than 160 million people in India are 
				considered &quot;Untouchable&quot;—people tainted by their birth into a 
				caste system that deems them impure, less than human. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Human rights abuses 
				against these people, known as Dalits, are legion. A random 
				sampling of headlines in mainstream Indian newspapers tells 
				their story: &quot;Dalit boy beaten to death for plucking flowers&quot;; &quot;Dalit 
				tortured by cops for three days&quot;; &quot;Dalit 'witch' paraded naked 
				in Bihar&quot;; &quot;Dalit killed in lock-up at Kurnool&quot;; &quot;7 Dalits burnt 
				alive in caste clash&quot;; &quot;5 Dalits lynched in Haryana&quot;; &quot;Dalit 
				woman gang-raped, paraded naked&quot;; &quot;Police egged on mob to lynch 
				Dalits&quot;. <!--- deckend ---></font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Dalits are not allowed 
				to drink from the same wells, attend the same temples, wear 
				shoes in the presence of an upper caste, or drink from the same 
				cups in tea stalls,&quot; said Smita Narula, a senior researcher with 
				Human Rights Watch, and author of <i>Broken People: Caste 
				Violence Against India's &quot;Untouchables.&quot;</i> Human Rights Watch 
				is a worldwide activist organization based in New York. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India's Untouchables are 
				relegated to the lowest jobs, and live in constant fear of being 
				publicly humiliated, paraded naked, beaten, and raped with 
				impunity by upper-caste Hindus seeking to keep them in their 
				place. Merely walking through an upper-caste neighborhood is a 
				life-threatening offense. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nearly 90 percent of all 
				the poor Indians and 95 percent of all the illiterate Indians 
				are Dalits, according to figures presented at the International 
				Dalit Conference that took place May 16 to 18 in Vancouver, 
				Canada. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Crime Against Dalits</b>
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Statistics compiled by 
				India's National Crime Records Bureau indicate that in the year 
				2000, the last year for which figures are available, 25,455 
				crimes were committed against Dalits. Every hour two Dalits are 
				assaulted; every day three Dalit women are raped, two Dalits are 
				murdered, and two Dalit homes are torched. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No one believes these 
				numbers are anywhere close to the reality of crimes committed 
				against Dalits. Because the police, village councils, and 
				government officials often support the caste system, which is 
				based on the religious teachings of Hinduism, many crimes go 
				unreported due to fear of reprisal, intimidation by police, 
				inability to pay bribes demanded by police, or simply the 
				knowledge that the police will do nothing. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There have been 
				large-scale abuses by the police, acting in collusion with upper 
				castes, including raids, beatings in custody, failure to charge 
				offenders or investigate reported crimes,&quot; said Narula. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That same year, 68,160 
				complaints were filed against the police for activities ranging 
				from murder, torture, and collusion in acts of atrocity, to 
				refusal to file a complaint. Sixty two percent of the cases were 
				dismissed as unsubstantiated; 26 police officers were convicted 
				in court. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite the fact that 
				untouchability was officially banned when India adopted its 
				constitution in 1950, discrimination against Dalits remained so 
				pervasive that in 1989 the government passed legislation known 
				as The Prevention of Atrocities Act. The act specifically made 
				it illegal to parade people naked through the streets, force 
				them to eat feces, take away their land, foul their water, 
				interfere with their right to vote, and burn down their homes.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since then, the violence 
				has escalated, largely as a result of the emergence of a 
				grassroots human rights movement among Dalits to demand their 
				rights and resist the dictates of untouchability, said Narula.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Lack of Enforcement, 
				Not Laws</b> </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Enforcement of laws 
				designed to protect Dalits is lax if not non-existent in many 
				regions of India. The practice of untouchability is strongest in 
				rural areas, where 80 percent of the country's population 
				resides. There, the underlying religious principles of Hinduism 
				dominate. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hindus believe a person 
				is born into one of four castes based on karma and &quot;purity&quot;—how 
				he or she lived their past lives. Those born as Brahmans are 
				priests and teachers; Kshatriyas are rulers and soldiers; 
				Vaisyas are merchants and traders; and Sudras are laborers. 
				Within the four castes, there are thousands of sub-castes, 
				defined by profession, region, dialect, and other factors.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Untouchables are 
				literally outcastes; a fifth group that is so unworthy it 
				doesn't fall within the caste system. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although based on 
				religious principles practiced for some 1,500 years, the system 
				persists today for economic as much as religious reasons. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because they are 
				considered impure from birth, Untouchables perform jobs that are 
				traditionally considered &quot;unclean&quot; or exceedingly menial, and 
				for very little pay. One million Dalits work as manual 
				scavengers, cleaning latrines and sewers by hand and clearing 
				away dead animals. Millions more are agricultural workers 
				trapped in an inescapable cycle of extreme poverty, illiteracy, 
				and oppression. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although illegal, 40 
				million people in India, most of them Dalits, are bonded 
				workers, many working to pay off debts that were incurred 
				generations ago, according to a report by Human Rights Watch 
				published in 1999. These people, 15 million of whom are 
				children, work under slave-like conditions hauling rocks, or 
				working in fields or factories for less than U.S. $1 day. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Crimes Against Women</b>
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dalit women are 
				particularly hard hit. They are frequently raped or beaten as a 
				means of reprisal against male relatives who are thought to have 
				committed some act worthy of upper-caste vengeance. They are 
				also subject to arrest if they have male relatives hiding from 
				the authorities. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A case reported in 1999 
				illustrates the toxic mix of gender and caste. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A 42-year-old Dalit 
				woman was gang-raped and then burnt alive after she, her 
				husband, and two sons had been held in captivity and tortured 
				for eight days. Her crime? Another son had eloped with the 
				daughter of the higher-caste family doing the torturing. The 
				local police knew the Dalit family was being held, but did 
				nothing because of the higher-caste family's local influence.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is very little 
				recourse available to victims. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A report released by 
				Amnesty International in 2001 found an &quot;extremely high&quot; number 
				of sexual assaults on Dalit women, frequently perpetrated by 
				landlords, upper-caste villagers, and police officers. The study 
				estimates that only about 5 percent of attacks are registered, 
				and that police officers dismissed at least 30 percent of rape 
				complaints as false. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The study also found 
				that the police routinely demand bribes, intimidate witnesses, 
				cover up evidence, and beat up the women's husbands. Little or 
				nothing is done to prevent attacks on rape victims by gangs of 
				upper-caste villagers seeking to prevent a case from being 
				pursued. Sometimes the policemen even join in, the study 
				suggests. Rape victims have also been murdered. Such crimes 
				often go unpunished. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thousands of pre-teen 
				Dalit girls are forced into prostitution under cover of a 
				religious practice known as <i>devadasis</i>, which means 
				&quot;female servant of god.&quot; The girls are dedicated or &quot;married&quot; to 
				a deity or a temple. Once dedicated, they are unable to marry, 
				forced to have sex with upper-caste community members, and 
				eventually sold to an urban brothel. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Resistance and 
				Progress</b> </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Within India, grassroots 
				efforts to change are emerging, despite retaliation and 
				intimidation by local officials and upper-caste villagers. In 
				some states, caste conflict has escalated to caste warfare, and 
				militia-like vigilante groups have conducted raids on villages, 
				burning homes, raping, and massacring the people. These raids 
				are sometimes conducted with the tacit approval of the police.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the province Bihar, 
				local Dalits are retaliating, committing atrocities also. 
				Non-aligned Dalits are frequently caught in the middle, victims 
				of both groups. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There is a growing 
				grassroots movement of activists, trade unions, and other NGOs 
				that are organizing to democratically and peacefully demand 
				their rights, higher wages, and more equitable land 
				distribution,&quot; said Narula. &quot;There has been progress in terms of 
				building a human rights movement within India, and in drawing 
				international attention to the issue.&quot; </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In August 2002, the UN 
				Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UN CERD) 
				approved a resolution condemning caste or descent-based 
				discrimination. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;But at the national 
				level, very little is being done to implement or enforce the 
				laws,&quot; said Narula. <!-- Begin Inline Subscribe form --></font>
