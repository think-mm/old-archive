  <p align="justify">Patriotism and Government (a few excerpts) By Leo Tolstoy 
	[May 10, o.s., 1900.] </p>
	<p align="justify">(Dedicated by Tushar Sarkar to a self-styled 'rational 
	thinker') </p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="http://www.datejesus.com/patriotism.jpg"></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">************************************************* </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The time is fast approaching when 
	to call a man a patriot will be the deepest insult You can offer him. 
	Patriotism now means advocating plunder in the interests of the privileged 
	classes of the particular State system into which we have happened to be 
	born.&quot; - E. BELFORT BAX. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">I. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have already several times 
	expressed the thought that in our day the feeling of patriotism is an 
	unnatural, irrational, and harmful feeling, and a cause of a great part of 
	the ills from which mankind is suffering, and that, consequently, this 
	feeling--should not be cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the 
	contrary, be suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational 
	men. Yet, strange to say--though it is undeniable that the universal 
	armaments and destructive wars which are ruining the peoples result from 
	that one feeling--all my arguments showing the backwardness, anachronism, 
	and harmfulness of patriotism have been met, and are still met, either by 
	silence, by intentional misinterpretation, or by a strange unvarying reply 
	to the effect that only bad patriotism (Jingoism or Chauvinism) is evil, but 
	that real good patriotism is a very elevated moral feeling, to condemn which 
	is not only irrational but wicked. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What this real, good patriotism 
	consists in, we are never told; or,if anything is said about it, instead of 
	explanation we get declamatory, inflated phrases, or, finally, some other 
	conception is substituted for patriotism-- something which has nothing in 
	common with the patriotism we all know, and from the results of which we all 
	suffer so severely. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It would, therefore, seem obvious 
	that patriotism as a feeling is bad and harmful, and as a doctrine is 
	stupid. For it is clear that if each people and each State considers itself 
	the best of peoples and States, they all live in a gross and harmful 
	delusion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">II. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One would expect the harmfulness and 
	irrationality of patriotism to be evident to everybody. But the surprising 
	fact is that cultured and learned men not only do not themselves notice the 
	harm and stupidity of patriotism, but they resist every exposure of it with 
	the greatest obstinacy and ardour (though without any rational grounds), and 
	continue to belaud it as beneficent and. elevating. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">...................... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But it does occur that an antiquated 
	idea, already replaced in people's consciousness by a higher one, is of such 
	a kind that its maintenance is profitable to those people who have the 
	greatest influence in their society. And then it happens that this 
	antiquated idea, though it is in sharp contradiction to the whole 
	surrounding form of life, which has been altering in other respects, 
	continues to influence people and to sway their actions. Such retention of 
	antiquated ideas always has occurred, and still does occur, in the region of 
	religion. The cause is, that the priests, whose profitable positions are 
	bound up with the antiquated religious idea, purposely use their power to 
	hold people to this antiquated idea. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The same thing occurs, and for 
	similar reasons, in the political sphere, with reference to the patriotic 
	idea, on which all arbitrary power is based. People to whom it is profitable 
	to do so, maintain that idea by artificial means, though it now lacks both 
	sense and utility. And as these people possess the most powerful means of 
	influencing others, they are able to achieve their object. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">III. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Patriotism , as a feeling of 
	exclusive love for one's own people, and as a doctrine of tile virtue of 
	sacrificing one's tranquillity, one's property, and ever, one's life, in 
	defence of one's own people from slaughter and outrage by their enemies, was 
	the highest idea of the period when each nation considered it feasible and 
	just, for its own advantage, to subject to slaughter and outrage the people 
	of other nations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But, already some 2,000 years ago 
	representatives of its in the person of the highest wisdom, began to 
	recognise the higher idea of a brotherhood of man; and that idea, 
	penetrating man's consciousness more and more, has in our time attained most 
	varied forms of realization. Thanks to improved means of communication, and 
	to the unity of industry, of trade, of the arts, and of science, men are 
	to-day so bound one to another that the danger of conquest, massacre, or 
	outrage by a neighbouring people, has quite disappeared, and all peoples 
	(the peoples, but not the Governments) live together in peaceful 1, mutually 
	advantageous, and friendly commercial, industrial, artistic, and scientific 
	relations, which they have no need and no desire to disturb. One would 
	think, therefore that the antiquated feeling of patriotism being superfluous 
	and incompatible with the consciousness we have reached of the existence of 
	brotherhood among men of different nationalities-should dwindle more and 
	more until it completely disappears. Yet the very opposite of this occurs: 
	this harmful and antiquated feeling not only continues to exist, but burns 
	more and more fiercely. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The peoples, without any reasonable 
	ground, and contrary alike to their conception of right and to their own 
	advantage, not only sympathize with Governments and their attacks on other 
	nations, in their seizures of foreign possessions, and in defending by force 
	what they have already stolen, but even themselves demand such attacks, 
	seizures and defences: are glad of them, and take pride in them. The small 
	oppressed nationalities which have fallen under the power of great 
	States--the Poles, Irish, Bohemians, Finns, or Armenians-- resenting the 
	patriotism of their conquerors, which is the cause of their oppression, 
	catch from them the infection of this feeling of patriotism--which has 
	ceased to be necessary, and is now obsolete, unmeaningful, and harmful--and 
	to catch it to such a degree that all their activity is concentrated upon 
	it, and they, themselves suffering from the patriotism of the stronger 
	nations, are ready, for the sake of patriotism, to perpetrate on other 
	peoples the very same deeds that their oppressors have perpetrated and are 
	perpetrating on them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This occurs because the ruling 
	classes (including not only the actual rulers with their officials, but all 
	the classes who enjoy an exceptionally advantageous position: the 
	capitalists, journalists, and most of the artists and scientists) can retain 
	their position--exceptionally advantageous in comparison with that of the 
	labouring masses--thanks only to Government organization, which rests on 
	patriotism. They have in their hands all the most powerful means of 
	influencing the people, and always sedulously support patriotic feelings in 
	themselves and others, more especially as those feelings which uphold the 
	Government's power are those that are always best rewarded by that power.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every official prospers the more in 
	his career, the more patriotic he is; so also the army man gets promotion in 
	time of war--the war id produced by patriotism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Patriotism and its 
	results--wars--give an enormous revenue to the newspaper trade, and profits 
	to many other trades. Every writer, teacher, and professor is more secure in 
	his place the more he preaches patriotism. Every Emperor and King obtains 
	the more fame the more he is addicted to patriotism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ruling classes have in their 
	hands the army, money, the schools, the churches, and the press. In the 
	schools, they kindle patriotism in the children by means of histories 
	describing their own people as the best of all peoples and always in the 
	right. Among adults they kindle it by spectacles, jubilees, monuments, and 
	by a lying patriotic press. Above all, they inflame patriotism in this way: 
	perpetrating every kind of harshness and injustice against other nations, 
	they provoke in them enmity towards their own people, and then in turn 
	exploit that enmity to embitter their people against the foreigner. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The intensification of this terrible 
	feeling of patriotism has gone on among the European people in a rapidly 
	increasing progression, and in our time has reached the utmost limits, 
	beyond which there is no room for it to extend. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><font size="5">IV.</font> </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="center"><img src="http://www.apolitical.info/images/003a.jpg"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ruling classes of Germany 
	excited the patriotism of the masses of their people to such a degree that, 
	in the second half of the nineteenth century, a law was proposed in 
	accordance with which all the men had to become soldiers: all the sons, 
	husbands, fathers, learned men, and godly men, had to learn to murder, to 
	become submissive slaves of those above them in military rank, and be 
	absolutely ready to kill whomsoever they were ordered to kill: to kill men 
	of oppressed nationalities, and their own working-men standing up for their 
	rights, and even their own fathers and brothers--as was publicly proclaimed 
	by that most impudent of potentates, William II. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That horrible measure, outraging all 
	man's best feelings in the grossest manner, was, under tire influence of 
	patriotism, acquiesced in without murmur by the people of Germany. It 
	resulted in their victory over the French. That victory yet further excited 
	the patriotism of Germany, and, by reaction, that of France, Russia, and the 
	other Powers; and the men of the European countries unresistingly submitted 
	to the introduction of general military service--i.e., to a state of slavery 
	involving a degree of humiliation and submission incomparably worse than any 
	slavery of the ancient world. After this servile submission of the masses to 
	the calls of patriotism, the audacity, cruelty, and insanity of the 
	Governments knew no bounds. A competition in the usurpation of other 
	peoples' lands in Asia, Africa, and America began-evoked partly by whim, 
	partly by vanity, and partly by covetousness and was accompanied by ever 
	greater and greater distrust and enmity between the Governments. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The destruction of the inhabitants 
	on the lands seized was accepted as a quite natural proceeding. The only 
	question was, who should be first in seizing other peoples' land and 
	destroying the inhabitants? All the Governments not only most evidently 
	infringed, and are infringing, the elementary demands of justice in relation 
	to the conquered peoples, and in relation to one another, but they were 
	guilty, and continue to be guilty, of every kind of cheating, swindling, 
	bribing, fraud, spying, robbery, and murder; and the peoples not only 
	sympathized, and still sympathize, with them in all this, but they rejoice 
	when it is their own Government and not another Government that commits such 
	crimes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mutual enmity between the 
	different peoples and States has reached latterly such amazing dimensions 
	that, notwithstanding the fact that there is no reason why one State should 
	attack another, everyone knows that all the Governments stand with their 
	claws out and showing their teeth, and only waiting for someone to be in 
	trouble, or become weak, in order to tear him to pieces with as little risk 
	as possible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the peoples of the so-called 
	Christian world have been reduced by patriotism to such a state of 
	brutality, that not only those who are obliged to kill or be killed desire 
	slaughter and rejoice in murder, but all the people of Europe and America, 
	living peaceably in their homes exposed to no danger, are, at each war 
	thanks to easy means of communication and to the press--in the position of 
	the spectators in a Roman circus, and, like them, delight in the slaughter, 
	and raise the bloodthirsty cry, 'Pollice verso.' </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But that is not all. Every increase 
	in the army of one nation (and each nation, being in danger, seeks to 
	increase its army for patriotic reasons) obliges its neighbours to increase 
	their armies, also from patriotism, and this evokes a fresh increase by the 
	first nation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And the same thing occurs with 
	fortifications and navies: one State has built ten ironclads, a neighbour 
	builds eleven ; then the first builds twelve, and so on to infinity. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'I'll pinch you.' 'And I'll punch 
	your head.' 'And I'll stab you with a dagger.' And I'll bludgeon you.' 'And 
	I'll shoot you.' . . . Only bad children, drunken men, or animals, quarrel 
	or fight so, but yet it is just what is going on among the highest 
	representatives of the most enlightened Governments, the very men who 
	undertake to direct the education and the morality of their subjects. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><font size="5">V.</font> </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Governments, to have a reason for 
	existing, must defend their people from other people's attack. But not one 
	people wishes to attack, or does attack, another. And therefore Governments, 
	far from wishing for peace, carefully excite the anger of other nations 
	against themselves. And having excited other people's anger against 
	themselves, and stirred up the patriotism of their own people, each 
	Government then assures its people that it is in danger and must be 
	defended. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And having the power in their hands, 
	the Governments can both irritate other nations and excite patriotism at 
	home, and they carefully do both the one and the other; nor can they act 
	otherwise, for their existence depends on thus acting. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If, in former times, Governments 
	were necessary to defend their people from other people's attacks, now, on 
	the contrary, Governments artificially disturb the peace that exists between 
	the nations, and provoke enmity among them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When it was necessary to plough in 
	order to sow ploughing was wise; but evidently it is absurd and' armful to 
	go on ploughing after the seed has been sown. But this is just what the 
	Governments are obliging their people to do: to infringe the unit which 
	exists, and which nothing would infringe if it were not for the Governments.
	</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">VI.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Not only military Governments, 
	but Governments in general, could be, I will not say useful, but at least 
	harmless, only if they consisted of immaculate, holy people, as is 
	theoretically the case among the Chinese. But then Governments, by the 
	nature of their activity, which consists in committing acts of violence are 
	always composed of elements the most contrary to holiness-of the most 
	audacious, unscrupulous, and perverted people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Government, therefore, and 
	especially a Government entrusted with military power, is the most dangerous 
	organization possible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Government, in the widest sense, 
	including capitalists and the Press, is nothing else than an organization 
	which places the greater part of the people in the power of a smaller part, 
	who dominate them; that smaller part is subject to a yet smaller part I and 
	that again to a yet smaller, and so oil, reaching at last a few people, or 
	one single man, who by means of military force has power over all the rest. 
	So that all this organization resembles a cone, of which all the parts are 
	completely in the power of those people, or of that one person, who happen 
	to be at the apex. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The apex of the cone is seized by 
	those who are more cunning, audacious, and unscrupulous than the rest, or by 
	someone who happens to be the heir of those who were audacious and 
	unscrupulous. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today it may be Boris Godunof, and 
	tomorrow Gregory Otrepyef. Today the licentious Catherine, who with her 
	paramours has murdered her husband; tomorrow Pougatchof ; then Paul the 
	madman, Nicholas L, or Alexander. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today it may be Napoleon, tomorrow a 
	Bourbon or an Orleans, a Boulanger or a Panama Company; to. day it may be 
	Gladstone, tomorrow Salisbury, Chamberlain, or Rhodes. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Verdana">VII.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To destroy Governmental violence, 
	only one thing is needed: it is that people should understand that the 
	feeling of patriotism, which alone supports that instrument of violence, is 
	a rude, harmful, disgraceful, and bad feeling, and, above all, is immoral. 
	It is a rude feeling, because it is one natural only to people standing on 
	the lowest level of morality, and expecting from other nations such outrages 
	as they themselves are ready to inflict; it is a harmful feeling, because it 
	disturbs advantageous and joyous, peaceful relations with other peoples, and 
	above all produces that Governmental organization under which power may 
	fall, and does fall, into the, hands of the worst men; it is a disgraceful 
	feeling, because it turns mail not merely into a slave, but into a fighting 
	cock, a bull, or a gladiator, who wastes his strength and his life for 
	objects which are not his own but his Governments'; and it is an immoral 
	feeling, because, instead of confessing one's self a son of God (as 
	Christianity teaches us) or even a free mail guided by his own reason, each 
	man under the influence of patriotism confesses himself the soil of his 
	fatherland and the slave of his Government, and commits actions contrary to 
	his reason and his conscience. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is only necessary that people

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is what a German soldier 
	writes: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'I went through two campaigns with 
	the Prussian Guards (in 1866 and 1870), and I hate war from the bottom of my 
	soul, for it has made me inexpressibly unfortunate. We wounded soldiers 
	generally receive such a miserable recompense that we have indeed to be 
	ashamed of having once been patriots. I, for instance, get nine pence a day 
	for my right arm, which was shot through at the attack on St. Privat, August 
	18, 1870. Some bunting dogs have more allowed for their keep, And I have 
	suffered for years from my twice wounded arm. Already in 1866 I took part in 
	the war against Austria, and fought at Trautenau and Koniggratz, and saw 
	horrors enough. In 1870, being in the reserve I was called out again; and, 
	it's like I have already said, I was wounded in the attack at St. Privat: my 
	right arm was twice shot through lengthwise. I had to leave a good place in 
	a brewery, and was unable afterwards to regain it. Since their I have never 
	been able to get on my feet again. The intoxication soon passed, and there 
	was nothing left for the wounded invalid but to keep himself alive on a 
	beggarly pittance eked out by charity. . . . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'In a world in which people run 
	round like trained animals, and are trot capable of any other idea than that 
	of overreaching one another for the sake of mammon--such a world let people 
	think me a crank; but, for all that, I feel in myself the divine idea of 
	peace, which is so beautifully expressed in the Sermon on the Mount. My 
	deepest conviction is that war is only trade on a larger scale-- the 
	ambitious and powerful trade with the happiness of the peoples. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'And what horrors do we not suffer 
	from it! Never shall I forget the pitiful groans that pierced one to the 
	marrow! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'People who never did each other any 
	harm begin to slaughter one another like wild animals, and petty, slavish 
	souls--implicate the good God, making Him their confederate in such deeds.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'My neighbor in the ranks bad his 
	jaw broken by a bullet. The poor wretch went wild with pain. He ran like a 
	madman, and in the scorching summer heat could not even get water to cool 
	his horrible wound. Our commander, the Crown Prince (who was afterwards the 
	noble Emperor Frederick), wrote in his diary War--is an irony oil the 
	Gospels.&quot; . . .' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">People are beginning to understand 
	the fraud of patriotism, in which all the Governments take such pains to 
	keep them involved. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">VIII. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And therefore emancipation from 
	patriotism, and the destruction of the despotism of Government that rests 
	upon it, cannot but be beneficial to mankind. ................ </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">IX. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Men, recollect yourselves! For the 
	sake of your well-being, physical and spiritual, for the sake of your 
	brothers and sisters, pause, consider, and think of what you are doing!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And there is only one way to destroy 
	this binding together- it is by shaking off the hypnotism of patriotism.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Understand that all the evils from 
	which you suffer, you yourselves cause by yielding to the suggestions by 
	which Emperors, Kings, Members of Parliament, Governors, officers, 
	capitalists, priests, authors, artists, and all who need this fraud of 
	patriotism in order to live upon your labour, deceive you! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whoever you may be--Frenchman, 
	Russian, Pole, Englishman, Irishman, or Bohemian- understand that all your 
	real human interests, whatever they may be agricultural, industrial, 
	commercial, artistic, or scientific--as well as your pleasures and joys, in 
	no way run counter to the interests of other peoples or States ; and that 
	you are united, by mutual co-operation, by interchange of services, by the 
	joy of wide brotherly intercourse, and by the interchange not merely of 
	goods but also of thoughts and feelings, with the folk of other lands.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If people would but understand that 
	they are riot the sons of some fatherland or other, nor of Governments, but 
	are sons of God, and can therefore neither be slaves nor enemies one to 
	another- those insane, unnecessary, worn-out, pernicious organizations 
	called Governments, and all the sufferings, violations, humiliations, and 
	crimes which they occasion, would cease. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">X. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Rabindranath Tagore's Critique of 
	Patriotism</b> [From Amartya Sen's 'Tagore and His India'] </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath rebelled against the 
	strongly nationalist form that the independence movement often took, and 
	this made him refrain from taking a particularly active part in contemporary 
	politics. He wanted to assert India's right to be independent without 
	denying the importance of what India could learnfreely and profitablyfrom 
	abroad. He was afraid that a rejection of the West in favor of an indigenous 
	Indian tradition was not only limiting in itself; it could easily turn into 
	hostility to other influences from abroad, including Christianity, which 
	came to parts of India by the fourth century, Judaism, which came through 
	Jewish immigration shortly after the fall of Jerusalem, as did 
	Zoroastrianism through Parsi immigration later on (mainly in the eighth 
	century), and, of courseand most importantlyIslam, which has had a very 
	strong presence in India since the tenth century. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's criticism of patriotism is 
	a persistent theme in his writings. As early as 1908, he put his position 
	succinctly in a letter replying to the criticism of Abala Bose, the wife of 
	a great Indian scientist, Jagadish Chandra Bose: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">&quot;Patriotism cannot be our 
		final spiritual shelter; my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for 
		the price of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over 
		humanity as long as I live.&quot;</font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His novel Ghare Baire (The Home and 
	the World) has much to say about this theme. In the novel, Nikhil, who is 
	keen on social reform, including women's liberation, but cool toward 
	nationalism, gradually loses the esteem of his spirited wife, Bimala, 
	because of his failure to be enthusiastic about anti-British agitations, 
	which she sees as a lack of patriotic commitment. Bimala becomes fascinated 
	with Nikhil's nationalist friend Sandip, who speaks brilliantly and acts 
	with patriotic militancy, and she falls in love with him. Nikhil refuses to 
	change his views: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">&quot;I am willing to serve my 
			country; but my worship I reserve for Right which is far greater 
			than my country. To worship my country as a god is to bring a curse 
			upon it.&quot; </font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the story unfolds, Sandip becomes 
	angry with some of his countrymen for their failure to join the struggle as 
	readily as he thinks they should (&quot;Some Mohamedan traders are still 
	obdurate&quot;). He arranges to deal with the recalcitrant by burning their 
	meager trading stocks and physically attacking them. Bimala has to 
	acknowledge the connection between Sandip's rousing nationalistic sentiments 
	and his sectarianand ultimately violentactions. The dramatic events that 
	follow (Nikhil attempts to help the victims, risking his life) include the 
	end of Bimala's political romance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is a difficult subject, and 
	Satyajit Ray's beautiful film of The Home and the World brilliantly brings 
	out the novel's tensions, along with the human affections and disaffections 
	of the story. Not surprisingly, the story has had many detractors, not just 
	among dedicated nationalists in India. Georg Lukács found Tagore's novel to 
	be &quot;a petit bourgeois yarn of the shoddiest kind,&quot; &quot;at the intellectual 
	service of the British police,&quot; and &quot;a contemptible caricature of Gandhi.&quot; 
	It would, of course, be absurd to think of Sandip as Gandhi, but the novel 
	gives a &quot;strong and gentle&quot; warning, as Bertolt Brecht noted in his diary, 
	of the corruptibility of nationalism, since it is not even-handed. Hatred of 
	one group can lead to hatred of others, no matter how far such feeling may 
	be from the minds of large-hearted nationalist leaders like Mahatma Gandhi.
