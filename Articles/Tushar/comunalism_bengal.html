	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My main objective in trying to open 
	a discussion on this subject in Mukto-mona is to explore the issue through 
	‘field work’; being a student and a professional in the earth sciences I 
	have learnt the value of field work not only in that branch of science but 
	also in social sciences. I am hoping that Mukto-mona will provide me with 
	that rare opportunity of accessing the field where I can find fellow 
	travellers from ‘both communities’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My Hindu background, a social 
	upbringing that is anti-Muslim and membership of the majority community in 
	western Bengal are three big obstacles in becoming ‘objective’ in this 
	subject. But, a continued and persistent hard battle to overcome these 
	obstacles has enabled me to ‘seek truth from facts’ and through 
	‘re-education of intellectuals’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I first tried to open the subject in 
	Mukto-mona towards the end of February last year, but unfortunately, there 
	was no response. This time I am very pleased to have three participations 
	already. However, I am embarrassed to say that due to some unforeseen 
	pressure of business, I won’t be able to participate fully in the debate and 
	discussions until April/May. Meanwhile, I shall contribute in a very limited 
	manner; the subject needs enormous research work. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">S R Akhtar has opened a ‘Pandora’s 
	box‘ for me! But, I think the problems are manageable. And, like Subimal, I 
	also welcome his ‘bold’ approach, without necessarily agreeing with some of 
	his assertions. Subimal has taken up and answered some of the issues, which 
	I wanted to raise, but many of these are, in my opinion, of secondary 
	importance at the present stage of the discussion. And I have very little 
	expertise in the field of literature. I agree with Subimal that Akhtar is 
	confusing &quot;Being influenced by British culture&quot; with &quot;being influenced by 
	the British liberal thinkers&quot;. Some say that Sukumar Roy’s famous and 
	immensely enjoyable ‘Ha Ja Ba Ra La’ (I can still recite from memory large 
	parts of it!!) was influenced by ‘Alice's adventures in wonderland’; but it 
	would be ludicrous to call that ‘plagiarising’! Rabindranath was deeply 
	influenced by Irish and Scottish music while he was in Britain, which led to 
	much of his creative music. Let us leave Jibanananda and others out of this 
	discussion for the moment, as I said these are matters of secondary 
	importance just now. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think, the only way to make 
	progress in this discussion is to either give enough evidence for any 
	viewpoint, or to admit that they are only assertions, hypotheses, being put 
	forward for ‘testing’, to be backed by evidence later. On the basis of some 
	initial studies on some aspects of the subject, I would like to put forward 
	the following hypotheses, via quotes from relevant sources, without treating 
	the quotes as evidence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is necessary to study the subject 
	historically; (a) pre-1757, (b) 1757-1857, and (c) 1857-1905. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(a) Pre-1757 Hypothesis 1: During 
	Mughal rule ‘Bengali nationalism’ was much stronger than communalism. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“….This is not to say that religious 
	differences per se provide a satisfactory explanation for the course of 
	modern Bengali politics, although it has often been interpreted in this way. 
	The introduction of Islam has certainly had a marked effect upon Bengali 
	polity, but the character of Islam in Bengal has not been quite the same as 
	that in the northwestern part of India. Islam emerged as the dominant 
	political force in India following the Turki-Afghan invasions of the twelfth 
	century AD, establishing a firm base on the Indo-Gangetic plain during the 
	rule of the Delhi Sultans.Bengal, on the eastern extremity of the Gangetic 
	valley, received its introduction to Islam only after the religion's 
	uncompromising orthodoxy had been mellowed by its experiences of Indian 
	culture, the activities of the Sufis, and the infusion of converted Hindus 
	into Islam's fold. As had been the case in other parts of India which came 
	into contact with Islam, many of the converts came from the lower classes, 
	attracted by the principles of equality and fraternity enshrined in the 
	Koranic message. In Bengal, these converts not only retained their Bengali 
	language, but much of their Hindu tradition as well. Others converted to 
	Islam for economic advantage. In either case, the new Muslims were different 
	in their approach to their faith from many of their more orthodox brethren 
	in the west of India and beyond. Islam entered Bengal first not as a 
	political force, but through the activities of Sufi mystics. The religious 
	beliefs of these teachers were not out of keeping with indigenous Bengali 
	philosophical tenets, and their mendicant behaviour was quite familiar to 
	the majority of Bengalis, brought up in the presence of sadhus, Hindu holy 
	men. On the philosophical level, there was much in common between Hinduism 
	and liberal forms of Islam, but where proselytising took place amongst the 
	lower classes in Bengal, philosophy was not of great importance, as was 
	observed in a nineteenth century official report: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some of them [the peasants of 
	Bengal] have never heard of Mohammed; some regard him as a person 
	corresponding in their system of thought to Rama or Lakshman of the Hindus. 
	The Koran is hardly read even in Bengali, and in Arabic not at all; many of 
	those who have heard of it cannot tell who wrote it. Yet any Moslem peasant 
	is able to repeat a few scraps of prayer in Arabic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sufi and bhakti syncretism thus 
	blurred the distinctions between forms of Hindu and Muslim worship in 
	Bengal, but without achieving anything approaching a synthesis between the 
	two religions…… </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consciousness of Bengali identity 
	pervading Hindu and Muslim society had an appreciable effect in the 
	political sphere. Even during the great period of Mughal supremacy, Bengali 
	'nationalism' tended to compete with rather than complement the unifying 
	character of Islam even among Bengali Muslims. Bengal, under the Mughals, 
	was a rebellious state with a strong awareness of its regional identity, and 
	its indigenous rulers took opportunities when they arose to exploit 
	weaknesses in the central imperial authority”……..( Bangladesh and the Indian 
	Ocean, 1971-1975, Denis Wright, Chapter 1, Origins of Bangladesh). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(b) 1757-1857 Hypothesis 2: It is 
	understandable that the British would use the Hindus against the Muslim 
	ruling classes from 1757. From 1757, the two Bengali communities, in eastern 
	and western Bengal started to develop separately, under the leadership of 
	respective landed gentry and upper middle classes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“……Although it was not usually a 
	matter of critical importance to the Bengali peasant who held the reins of 
	power - indeed, rulers of both religious persuasions in India tended to make 
	the same demands upon the peasantry - the Muslim community derived a measure 
	of psychological security from the fact that Muslims were seen to be in the 
	most vital positions of authority in government throughout the entire period 
	of Muslim rule. Although for most of the Mughal period Bengali rather than 
	Muslim nationalism was ascendant, the British assumption of political 
	control forced Bengali Muslims to see their relationship with the Hindus in 
	a new light. Without the psychological prop of Mughal dominance over India, 
	Bengali Muslims gradually withdrew from the cooperation with Hindus which 
	was essential for Bengali nationalism to retain its supremacy. The strength 
	of Bengali nationalism steadily deteriorated during the British period in 
	favour of antagonism between an ascendant class of prosperous Hindus and a 
	mass of uneducated Muslim peasants and labourers….. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By several of its policies, the 
	British administration exacerbated the growth of communalism in Bengal, 
	although this result was, at first, unintentional. Under the Mughals, the 
	Muslim aristocracy was an integral part of the economic system, passing on 
	revenue collected by their Hindu agents to the emperor. With the British 
	penetration of Bengal, the Muslim nobility lost this function, for the East 
	India Company had no use for them in this capacity. Instead, the Hindu 
	agents previously employed by the aristocracy became directly responsible to 
	the Company. Aware of the potential for disorder which could follow if all 
	avenues of administration were suddenly closed to the Muslim upper classes 
	in Bengal, the Company allowed certain monopolies to remain in Muslim 
	hands…….. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In spite of these traditions, 
	effective power soon passed from the hands of the Muslim nobility……. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Bengali Muslim aristocracy had 
	its own problems. It was more concerned with alleviating financial distress 
	as a result of the implementation of Permanent Settlement than with 
	organisations such as Sir Sayyid's. Introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793 
	and intended to modernise the old feudal structure, it proved unsuitable for 
	prevailing conditions in Bengal, and taxed the old aristocracy virtually out 
	of existence. The Muslim estate holders were forced to pay off their taxes 
	by selling portions or all of their estates, and it was the rising class of 
	Hindu banyans, with capital and knowledge of British law behind them, who 
	bought up the land. As a direct result of Permanent Settlement, the last 
	source of wealth for the Bengali Muslim aristocracy disappeared, and it fell 
	into the hands of those who were already entrenched in the British 
	administrative system. (This section’s original place in the article changed 
	by TS)……. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Permanent Settlement was also 
	disastrous for the Bengali Muslim peasant, for 'by concentrating proprietary 
	rights in the hands of the former state revenue collector (the zamindar) 
	[it] wiped out at a stroke the peasant's hold on the land at the same time 
	as transforming payments from a constant form of tax to rent which could 
	legally be set at any level pleasing the landlord'.The peasant had no means 
	of appeal against this system, and was at the mercy of his new landlords. 
	(This section’s original place in the article changed by TS)……. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">……Lord MacAuley's Minute 
	recommending English as the medium of instruction for education was approved 
	by Governor-General Bentinck on 7 March 1835, and in 1844 the government 
	made it clear that western and English educated Indians would be preferred 
	for public appointment.The result was a widening of the gap between Hindus 
	and Muslims, especially as the growing Hindu upper class became identified 
	by the Muslim peasantry as the class enemy. Hindus read Hindu upper classes 
	–TS) generally supported the British administration and denounced their 
	former rulers (upper class Hindus were not part of the pre-1757 ‘Bengali 
	nationalism’? – TS) , while the displaced Muslim aristocracy called the 
	Muslim peasantry to assist them in re-establishing Muslim rule in the 
	province. (emphasis added by TS).This sense of grievance exhibited by the 
	Muslims extended to the British, and constituted a component of the Bengali 
	Muslim role in the Mutiny of 1857. (Ibid) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“…The Hindus were in a better 
	position in terms of economic status, professional qualities etc, than the 
	Muslims. During the pre-Sepoy Mutiny period, section of Hindu traders 
	greatly helped the British while their Muslim counterparts did not. The 
	British were angry. With the spread of Western education, big way. But the 
	Muslims could not.”(Subhayu Banerjee, Partition of Bengal, internet) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">© 1857- 1905 Hypothesis 3: From 
	1857, the separate development of Hindu and Muslim communities solidified. 
	By 1905 it was almost complete. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“The failure of the Mutiny had 
	implications for Hindu-Muslim relations throughout India, and nowhere were 
	its consequences more keenly felt than in Bengal. The British government 
	bestowed the heaviest share of the blame for the uprising upon the Muslim 
	community, whose dedication to the Mughal emperor (in whose name the 
	'mutiny' took place) was perceived to be the most fanatical. Following the 
	suppression of the Mutiny, the British administration openly declared its 
	intention to destroy any group which might persevere in attempts at armed 
	opposition to the newly re-established British authority. This threat was 
	aimed directly at Muslims, who were more prone to seek such a solution than 
	the Hindus, having less to lose by doing so. While the Mutiny briefly opened 
	up the possibility of winning freedom by revolutionary means, popular faith 
	in these means was shaken by defeat. Even so, the suppression of the Mutiny 
	did not eliminate entirely Muslim attempts to undermine British rule, and 
	this in itself indicates the extent of Muslim frustration with British rule 
	at the time. In the 1870s, the Wahhabi movement sent waves of agitation 
	through Bengal, and the Bengali Muslim intelligentsia was under its 
	influence. ( Bangladesh and the Indian Ocean, 1971-1975, Denis Wright, 
	Chapter 1, Origins of Bangladesh). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“From 1870 onwards, the British 
	started inciting the Hindus and the Muslims to form their own political 
	parties to establish their distinct religious identities. That was perhaps, 
	the beginning of the communalisation of politics. The British not only 
	encouraged the two communities to form political parties along religious 
	lines, they took various constructive steps to create a situation whereby 
	Hindus and Muslims would be forced to think in a way as if their religious 
	identity is at peril. This effort culminated in the partition of Bengal in 
	1905. West Bengal, Orissa and Bihar was on one side and the erstwhile east 
	Bengal and Assam was on the other. The partition was made along communal 
	lines. This partition provided an impetus to the religious divide and, as a 
	result of that, All India Muslim League and All India Hindu Mahasabha was 
	formed. Both the organisations aimed at fanning communal passions.” (Subhayu 
	Banerjee, Partition of Bengal, internet) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“The publication of the original 
	proposals towards the end of 1903 had aroused unprecedented opposition, 
	especially among the influential educated middle-class Hindus. The proposed 
	territorial adjustment seemed to touch the existing interest groups and 
	consequently led to staunch opposition. The Calcutta lawyers apprehended 
	that the creation of a new province would mean the establishment of a Court 
	of Appeal at Dacca and diminish the importance of their own High Court. 
	Journalists feared the appearance of local newspapers, which would restrict 
	the circulation of the Calcutta Press. The business community of Calcutta 
	visualised the shift of trade from Calcutta to Chittagong, which would be 
	nearer, and logically the cheaper port. The Zamindars who owned vast landed 
	estates both in west and east Bengal foresaw the necessity of maintaining 
	separate establishments at Dhaka that would involve extra expenditure.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The educated Bengali Hindus felt 
	that it was a deliberate blow inflicted by Curzon at the national 
	consciousness and growing solidarity of the Bengali-speaking population. The 
	Hindus of Bengal, who controlled most of Bengal's commerce and the different 
	professions and led the rural society, opined that the Bengali nation would 
	be divided, making them a minority in a province including the whole of 
	Bihar and Orissa. They complained that it was a veiled attempt by Curzon to 
	strangle the spirit of nationalism in Bengal. They strongly believed that it 
	was the prime object of the government to encourage the growth of a Muslim 
	power in eastern Bengal as a counterpoise to thwart the rapidly growing 
	strength of the educated Hindu community. Economic, political and communal 
	interests combined together to intensify the opposition against the 
	partition measure… </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The economic aspect of the 
	(swadeshi) movement (1905) was partly responsible for encouraging separatist 
	forces within the Muslim society. The superiority of the Hindus in the 
	sphere of trade and industry alarmed the Muslims. Fear of socio-economic 
	domination by the Hindus made them alert to safeguard their own interests. 
	These apprehensions brought about a rift in Hindu-Muslims relations. In 
	order to avoid economic exploitation by the Hindus, some wealthy Muslim 
	entrepreneurs came forward to launch new commercial ventures. One good 
	attempt was the founding of steamer companies operating between Chittagong 
	and Rangoon in 1906……….. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the context of the partition the 
	pattern of the land system in Bengal played a major role to influence the 
	Muslim mind. The absentee Hindu zamindars made no attempt to improve the lot 
	of the raiyats who were mostly Muslims. The agrarian disputes (between 
	landlords and tenants) already in existence in the province also appeared to 
	take a communal colour. It was alleged that the Hindu landlords had been 
	attempting to enforce Swadeshi ideas on the tenants and induce them to join 
	the anti-partition movement” (‘First Partition of Bengal’, source unknown, 
	internet) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Summing up: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“…the result was the creation of a 
	Hindu middle class without a significant Muslim counterpart, with Hindu 
	political and economic power centred upon Calcutta. The mass of the 
	peasantry, which constituted the most vulnerable class in Bengali society, 
	was overwhelmingly Muslim. A very small aristocratic Muslim elite existed in 
	British Bengal as a legacy of medieval Muslim empires, but this elite and 
	the peasantry had nothing in common.” Bangladesh and the Indian Ocean, 
	1971-1975, Denis Wright, Chapter 1, Origins of Bangladesh). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The socio-economic origins of 
	communalism in Bengal are to be found in the rise of Hindu and Muslim 
	merchant classes and upper middle classes, ‘created by the bureaucratic and 
	industrial imperialism of the British’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The development of the democratic 
	revolution in Bengal was thwarted by British colonialism, using communalism 
	as the main tool. For understandable reasons, anti-imperialist nationalism 
	developed more amongst the Hindu middle classes than amongst the Muslim 
	counterparts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">P.S. The ‘independent greater 
	Bengal’ was referring to two ‘united Bengal’ plans of Sarat Bose and 
	Suhrawardy.</font></p>
