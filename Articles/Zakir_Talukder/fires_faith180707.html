	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin is kept fallen with his hands and legs tied 
	hard. His mouth and eyes remain uncovered. So if he needs, he can cry aloud. 
	But he does nothing. He is not lamenting. He expresses nothing at all. A 
	terrible shade of bewilderment prevails on his eyes. He is put half bent. 
	The ground below is too cool to burn his feet. The sun has been out of&nbsp; view 
	for three days. The biting cold air&nbsp; of&nbsp; Poush is blowing. Those who own 
	television or those who read newspaper know&nbsp;&nbsp; the temparature is now below 6 
	degrees. That’s why when Lehajuddin has been dropped here beaten, he must 
	have experienced&nbsp; burning touch. But now it is over. The part of his body&nbsp; 
	touching the ground has already become senseless. Due to such fastening rope 
	his hands and legs are tinged. His bare body seems black stained. The sign 
	of blows and knocks only. Blood dropped out of nose and lips has dried up 
	and sticky. A blackish line has come down from the nose and lips up to his 
	chin like the burrowed soil of earth worm.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">It is true Lehajuddin is not anxious about the matter 
	at all. He is thinking about the next action. It is also unknown to those 
	who will sit for enhancing judgment. The mob likes to impose stern 
	punishment after their first instantaneous attack- Kill the damned. Bury him 
	half&nbsp; and let the dog tear and enjoy him alive! Burn the wretched! Destroy 
	his abode and his offspring.! They are now thinking seriously about the 
	second phase of punishment which must be exemplary for all. After hearing 
	the story who dares commit the same sin in the whole universe! But the 
	problem arises over its being a religious issue. Since the matter provokes 
	religious reaction, it must have some holy guidance. The imams of the 
	mosques of the attached villages who lead the prayers, collect subscriptions 
	reciting the sermons in the loudspeakers and the Title failed teachers of 
	the madrashas are still unable to detect the Fatwa of Scriptures they will 
	impose for such an uncommon sin. The day to day matters that they deal are- 
	molestation, adulterate relationships , stealing, namaj, roza, etc. Even it 
	is not the matter of marriage and divorce. The thought that a human being 
	can commit such an unholy act never comes to their mind. So they can ‘t 
	recall any trial and Fatwa over this issue. The sinner must be punished. 
	It’s a must. An exemplary punishment. It’s such an act which never enters in 
	a nightmare too. Whoever has heard about it he has run terror torn. The man 
	whose mouth is never&nbsp; free from&nbsp; the smell of liquor or the branded thief 
	who has eight years confinement or the hermaphrodite who dances to be a 
	funny companion of the heroine in an opera or the lewd who discards his own 
	family to live in some prostitution or the secretary of a mosque committee 
	who commit theft of the money collected for the development has become 
	stupefied as soon as they have heard the incident.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The next door neighbor of Lehajuddin is Shawal Bibi who 
	has looked for him as his son. It is she who has made the complaint- 
	Lehajuddin has burnt&nbsp; the&nbsp; Quran to warm his hands. Hardly had&nbsp; he took up 
	the Quran when Shawal Bibi lost her sense shouting highly. And it is her 
	shriek which has helped the villagers to hold him red handed. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Burning the Quran to warm a human hand!&nbsp; So heinous a 
	sin! O wicked! Don’t you have the fear of eternal life? O imprudent! Sinful 
	worshipper of Satan, Don’t you keep a bit horror of&nbsp; the wrath of God. The 
	collection of paradigm has&nbsp; come from Allah direct and that will safeguard 
	the creation&nbsp; If a single word of the holy Guide is placed on one scale and 
	the total creation on the other, the later will weigh less. And the whole of 
	the creation is just a leaf&nbsp; of grass to a single word. Without the book&nbsp; 
	eighteen thousands creatures would be buried down in the dreadful sea. The 
	book is still saving the whole of the universe. You burnt this great Book!

	Doomsday . Today it’s for you, only for you all the people in this region 
	are fallen in the Sind of sorrows. You must be destroyed! We can’t allow you 
	to pollute our innocent ground&nbsp; anymore. Let him perish from the eyes of the

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Zamila, having returned home went to the grove of 
	plantain. Last night Zamila was engaged in Altab Khan’s house. She had to 
	clear the labor&nbsp; of the second daughter. Earlier she had touched the oil to 
	the pregnant girl. Now days there is crisis of begetters even in the village 
	not only that there are about four or five Dais (wit nurse/ foster mother 
	who helps progenitors to bear child out) in the attaching villages. Some of 
	them are trained governmentally too. If any Dai fails to attend any call, 
	she is sure to lose the house. Therefore nobody fails to attend the call and 
	works up to the clearing of womb. So Zamila was called for last night. It 
	took the whole night and even the next day. However the delivery was a 
	success. Allah is merciful and kind to do her work. The pain was continuing 
	long abnormally. Zamila got worried. It was probably a clipped delivery.&nbsp; 
	The male and the other females turned impatient. Now and then Aftab Khan 
	enquired- Zamila, can you do it? Do we need to go hospitals? Is it necessary 
	to call Dr. Khogen in? He may push saline.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Zamila was in another thought. If any family slips from 
	her clasp and if it turns to Dr. Khogen she will get no more chance. She 
	retorted rather confidently- If Allah does not think so, you shouldn’t think 
	it any more. And if it seems so, I must inform you. However the baby was 
	born well. Before lapping the grandson over Aftab Khan, she picked up a note 
	of one hundred taka. Besides, she would receive a sari and fifty kg rice.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Zamila had planted twenty saplings of plantain in a 
	piece of land attached to her house. They were cost free. She begged them 
	from Kobad master now if she nurses them properly, it will earn her taka two 
	thousand only after nine months. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Reaching the grove, Zamia lost her temper. Before going 
	to Aftab Khan’s house, she had told her husband to weed out the land. But 
	she found no trace of such work. She searched her husband to exclude her 
	anger. But Lehajuddin was nowhere. Then she entered the kitchen quite in 
	anger. The slothful man probably had no food the whole day! If requested 
	Shawal Bibi might have prepared rice and pulse. But Lehajuddin was ever 
	reluctant to do so.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Entering the yard, Lehajuddin laughed heartily- It is 
	you who labored the baby out. I am very happy. You did a great work. Allah 
	must help you.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Zamila has not forgotten the matter of plantain field 
	yet though it is diminished. She stirred the rice pot with her hands 
	impatiently- I told you to weed out the grove so many times! Do you find the 
	work too hard? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin seemed to be ashamed at this- Actually I was 
	making some kulukh ( a small clod of earth to ease oneself after urine or 
	bowels as a Muslim custom) All were finished so needed time to prepare them.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">He had learnt this new precept recently. If any Muslim 
	washes his posterior with water only, his body will remain impure. One 
	kulukh is for urine and three for bowels. If not the body will not be clean. 
	His Peer Kebla (spiritual guide) has asserted the necessity again and again. 
	The precept bears fully unchallengeable evidence behind it. This had 
	happened to his Great Peer of his present Peer. Once He used simply water 
	instead of&nbsp; kulukh. Afterwards when He stood on the jainamaj (Mat on which 
	the Muslims Pray) after ozu, it moved away. It was not a simple jainamaj at 
	all because it had been made of the gilaf of the Grand Peer Hazrat Abdul 
	Kader Zillani. So having seen the movement of the jainamaj the Great Peer 
	thought- It must be some tricks of the Devil- Satan Khannas. As soon as he 
	was ready to curse the devil, the jainamaj got voice from the Grand Peer- 
	You are unholy to pray still. You used no kulukh. Don’t stand on the blessed 
	jainamaj so impure. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">

	Everything. Don’t you understand dear beings? If He wishes, He can do

	see the magnanimity of Allah everywhere even today. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Some hard words were nearly peeping out. She does see 
	the sign of the Almighty through out her life. The male of the house does 
	not do any work He earns nothing though he enjoys all the fruits. The house 
	is run year to year somehow. This is the blessing of Allah!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zamila 
	checked herself breaking these hard nuts. She knows it very well that no 
	rebuke will change her husband. He may be ashamed to some extent but no 
	benefit it will bring. The man is always very simple. Besides he passes his 
	years only on Peer, Dervish, Allah and His Prophets. Even at his early youth 
	he has avoided work. The maintenance of a family with two daughters was so 
	difficult. And&nbsp; Zamila knows it well. She has already married her daughters 
	off.&nbsp; After shouldering all the responsibilities alone Zamila feels free. 
	They are only two now. The days will run as long as she is able.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin never talks of anything persistently. No 
	quarrel he has ever caused. He lives in his faith. He observes the 
	workmanship of Allah everywhere. If anyone asserts any incident of mystery, 
	he believes it unquestionably. Once he heard the name of Allah was found 
	inside the middle of a potato in Bogra . He rushed there . Again when he 
	listened an unknown grave rose up in Ghoraghat, he hastened to see it full 
	of belief. However Zamila has to pay the fare required for bus or train. But 
	if the place is near like four or six miles, he goes there on foot. In that 
	case Zamila gets another problem. She has to massage the paining feet of 
	Lehajuddin with some mustered oil. Her neighbour, Sawal Bibi laughs at this 
	saying- Why do you sacrifice so much on such a coward?&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin put the earthen clods on a piece of tin over 
	the thatched roof. He proceeds there to bring them down. On firing the 
	boiler, Zamila says- whatever you do, kulukh or anything else, you must weed 
	the field. The saplings may turn dwarf if you do not do it. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin gives her assurance- I must weed tomorrow.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">This village meets newspapers also. Television has come 
	earlier. After the evening a battery charged television is started for all 
	in the veranda of the Union Council. Only a few days ago, the villagers shut 
	their doors and slept immediately after the nightfall. At present many of 
	them arrive at the Council. They enjoy betel or biri (local made cigarette) 
	and watch dance, music. Dramas and movie up to the middle of night. Not only 
	that, some women are found sitting in the corner of the veranda. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">It is now known to all- the news is cast at 8pm with 
	the activities of the kings and ministers, home and abroad. They can even 
	analyze some national issues. Women know dramas are timed on Tuesday and 
	Thursday after the news. How charming the actors and the actresses look! How 
	exquisite their make ups are! Zamila watches TV too especially when she is 
	not called for any delivery. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">But Lehajuddin never goes there. He is forbidden to 
	watch TV by his Peer Kebla. It shows physical movements of some unknown 
	women. It is a great sin. His Peer Kebla has added- Television is a creation 
	of Allah. You see things activated from far away. Allah has a special 
	television too. His television is the whole universe. He observes what His 
	beings are performing on earth. Accordingly the angels count our sin and 
	piety. Earthly television telecast&nbsp; a few hours but Allah’s television does 
	it forever. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin watched the television only once. The Hindus 
	of India had broken Babri Mosque. What a sentimental issue that was! 
	Everybody went there to watch the heartrending incident. Lehajuddin was 
	there though he could not observe it to the end. Tears filled her heart 
	profusely.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Mean time there gathered a crowd of about fifty people. 
	Nekbar Mollah was the leader. Suddenly a slogan was chanted – Narae Takbeer! 
	(Allah is great)</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Wiping out his eyes L found the crowd full of 
	supernatural vehemence. Spears and sticks were handed over to all. Nekbar 
	Mollah shouted- Come forward, brethren, if you bear a drop of blood of a 
	Muslim, you must join us! Someone handed a bamboo stick to Lehajuddin </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;The crazy mob rushed to the Hindu village. The first 
	house was Maladhor’s . There was a furnace where lime was made of burnt 
	shells extracting from snails. The lime of Maladhor is very popular. It 
	enhances taste to beetles. With the forceful strikes the earthen furnace,

	heating their hands and legs with the bon fires. Without necessity no one 
	were going outside.&nbsp; That time Zamia reached the&nbsp; house and found the 
	pregnant wife fallen on wet ground beside a cow house. She was pale and very 
	sticky in body. The shade was temporarily built with jute sticks. The bed&nbsp; 
	was made upon some locks of&nbsp; paddy corns and a torn kantar (country made 
	blanket of old clothes). She was wearing a rejected sari To remove the acute

	anxious. The male were waiting long few yards away from the shade. They had 
	also prayed for her. They promised to&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifice before the Goddess Kali. 
	Their hearts ached at her shrikes&nbsp;&nbsp; too. They sat there quite helpless

	beside Maladhor.&nbsp; He was also encouraging them to remove tension. Cold air 
	was biting their body&nbsp; incessantly. But Lehajuddin was careless about it . 
	He felt another kind of warmth inwardly. It was cordiality. It was 
	solidarity. A spirit of liberation from a committed sin. They waited all 
	overnight. He prayed Tahajjot namaj at midnight. Gathering&nbsp; straw Maladhor 
	made a fire to toast&nbsp; the frozen body. They smoke Hukka together. Before 
	Fazr prayer a sound of crying was heard. At long last the baby was born! 
	Along with it all observed the wrinkled flower was in full bloom&nbsp; all around 
	the water of the pot. What a miracle! The expanding flower had cleared the 
	way of womb! Very affectionately Lehajuddin took it on his had and Maladhor 
	saluted&nbsp; it folding his hands&nbsp; fervently. Tears ran down her cheeks in 
	devotion.</font></p>

	heart melts with affection and content. The Peer remains outside sometimes. 
	He pays visit to other murids( follower). If they are detached many days 
	from the Peer, their devotion&nbsp; gets rusted. The Peer washes their mind 
	again. But Lehajuddin faces no problem if the Peer is outside. As soon as he 
	enters the mazar, a celestial reopens before him. The surrounding areas&nbsp; 
	appear purified with the touches of the Peers. The pioneer of the Tarika was 
	the grandfather of the present Peer. He had arrived here from Mokka At that 
	time the people of this region were non believers. He was ordained by Allah 
	in Mokka. He was to establish the supremacy of the Almighty here. He was 
	named Allah Baksh. There were more words added to it e.g. Bin and Ibn But 
	men like Lehajuddin can’t memorize them altogether. So the shortened name 
	Hazrat Allah Baksh was in use to them. He started from Mokka. /there was no 
	airplane then, not even any water ship. He had so many crafts and&nbsp; could 
	walk so long a way. Hot sand of&nbsp; deserts became tender, cold. Having walked 
	long he stopped before high mountains. How could he cross it? He stood on 
	his holy jainamaj and it took him to another side flying. After it&nbsp; he 
	started to walk again. Then came the barrier of deep forest A ferocious 
	tiger arrived there running and took him on his back. Jumping long he 
	finished the jungle fiercely like an Arab horse. Then the tiger returned to 
	its abode . Allah Baksh started&nbsp; walking again. And a sea was there. How to 
	overtake the vast water? The ship was not invented yet. With the name of 
	Allah he moved towards the sea. The sea was divided and&nbsp; an earthen road was 
	made. Even his feet were not wet. at the spots where big ships&nbsp; ever sink 
	vanish away. Only some spots of salt and water were seen under his kharam 
	(wooden sandle). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">So came Hazrat Allah Baksh. The nonbelievers&nbsp; with mass 
	soldiers dared not stand against Him. They were scattered like straws. A

	never enters into a human mind, got a quick invention or solution from him

	sapling of a banyan tree&nbsp; pierced out the next day. And only within three 
	days that sapling became so big a tree. His murids believe&nbsp; the tree is 
	spotted at the navel of the Peer. Every leaf of the tree is sacred. And so 
	the tree&nbsp; is the live evidence of His magic power. If anybody denies

	here. Is it is to&nbsp; sweep and wash so much waste? Nobody will assist in the 
	work too. Nevertheless, Lehajuddin finishes them alone. He has come on 
	Friday. It takes him nearly six days to sweep the ground. After the Asr 
	namaj on Thursday, he could finish the divine job.&nbsp; . Then he feels so tired 
	that he&nbsp; takes a bath and feels relieved. Such a mammoth task he has 
	performed! He is growing older. The spirit of youth is on the wane. He lies

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">She has gone for a call to the south village. To clear 
	the delivery of Akalu’s wife.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Surprisingly, Zamila is not so furious. Lehajuddin, she 
	finds is under the blanket waiting with many excuses and arguments. But she 
	pays no attention to that point. She is rather soft- When did you come? Have 
	you had anything?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin was not ready to hear the words .Getting no 
	similarity between the reality ant fear, he becomes captured spiritless. He 
	finds no words.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Being washed Zamila enters the kitchen. The sound of 
	mixing rice and dal reaches his ears. It reminds him about the miraculous 
	dish of the Peer. Huzur has promised him to give that very cauldron. Though 
	it was dream, the words of the Peer can’t be altered.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">He couldn’t control his emotion anymore.. He goes to 
	Zamila and sits by her. He starts with a spirited voice- What a great news&nbsp; 
	I have!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Zamila’s tone is warmth less- What is it?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">You need not burn your hands cooking any more.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Zamila is yet indifferent as before saying-Who will 
	cook for us then?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">None. No one needs to do it.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Will we fill our belly with air only?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Not with air. Rice – meat-polao-sweet- all that our 
	wish can select.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Afterwards Lehajuddin explains her in detail. Huzur has 
	promised that he would&nbsp; give him the magical dish. We will have no tension 
	for food.. Even we can entertain all the poor&nbsp; who live by our village.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin never speaks so many words at a time. Today 
	being sentimental he told so many things. Zamila has never looked at him. 
	Her hands are busy pushing fire wood in the boiler and the dish of rice. 
	Having seen her not a bit delighted&nbsp; and receiving no inspiration Lehajuddin 
	halts. He examines the&nbsp; face of Zamia critically- Don’t you believe?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">In a state of apathy Zamila says- man finds so many 
	things in dream.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin thinks to make her understand, this dream is 
	not the&nbsp; same as that of&nbsp; others. The Huzur has made himself present before 
	Lehajuddin. It is His kind return to Lehajuddin’s firm belief.&nbsp; He is not 
	just a dead man. If so He could not come in&nbsp; one’s own figure . Though some 
	great&nbsp; Peers are blessed with the power To justify his followers aspirations 
	He has done so. This is called the dream full of device . </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">This time Zamila snubs- Stop here. There miracles are 
	evaporated from the world. It is time to do work. If one works , he can 
	manage food. If not he is to starve. Drop the story&nbsp; of&nbsp; cauldron.&nbsp; </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Lehajuddin finds himself dumb- What are you talking 
	about! No miracles!&nbsp; The world runs without the commands of Allah! No 
	miracles does a Peer possess?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">When there Peers, there were supernatural powers. There 
	were prophets there were spiritual activities. As there is no one, no 
	miracle there is. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The words of the wife stroke the believer’s heart as a 
	missile. Are the crafts closed with the death of Peer? Does the blessing of 
	Allah&nbsp; finish&nbsp; from the world ? Lehajuddin claimed it boldly- Never!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Allah’s great&nbsp; craft is the Holy Quran. It never burns in fire.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Having memorized the matter Lehajuddin desires to 
	utilize it. He has ever heard from many eye witnesses that&nbsp; buildings may be 
	burnt to ashes but not the cover page of the Quran&nbsp; is harmed with fire. It 
	may at best burn the cover page but a single Arabic letter. Not only 
	Lehajuddin but also many villagers have heard this thing in religious 
	preaching,&nbsp; sermons and stories. Excess it to say, nobody doubts about the 
	matter . Yet something of course something has happened to Zamila. today.&nbsp; 
	She rather challenges to her husband- What an unbelievable thing you talk! 
	If the pages burn, the letter will burn too. Lehajuddin stands up instantly. 
	He has at last got a chance. The power of Allah&nbsp; persists even in this 
	sinful universe.&nbsp; He will prove it just now. As they&nbsp; have no Quran of their 
	own, he needs to go to mosque. Only then it comes into his mind- Sawal bibi 
	has one. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Jumping double pace Lehajuudin enters the room of&nbsp; 
	Sawal bibi. He takes the Quran from the shelf. He hastens to reach the

	<font face="Verdana">We stand before the wall of Prophet Solomon. Our united 
	utterance wishes for his happiness. The wish is not simply customary. The 
	sympathy and the security touch our heart too. We feel endless gratitude for 
	him as its bi product. He has planted the tree of faith and peace for us. So 
	our heartfelt wish&nbsp;&nbsp; can be explained diversely. We- Zamil, Faruk and I 
	represent three classes. That does not mean we are now in absolute form of 
	unity. But the reality makes us think we bear individual heritage of some 
	greater unity. We are only three hands of a triangle though we exploit one

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We understand about the other part.&nbsp; There remains the 
	force of destruction. We must keep the wall intact. The symbol of death is 
	so uncontrollable- so non stop! The force seems as unconquerable as the

	it spreads cool fear of death through the nerves&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We thank God again. He had sent an uncommon Wiseman in 
	our race. He could understand the diagram of nuclear even of stone. The yet 
	hazy darkness of the deep sea or the black untrodden under earth had failed 
	to keep their secrets from his sharp intelligence. Not only that he knew the 
	destiny of death. But he did not foretell them to his fellow beings. We, his 
	inferior followers only pass our time with some answers among the millions 
	of inquisitions. The highly gifted omniscient Man had taught Prophet Solomon 
	about the tricks and the devices of building the wall. He had also protected 
	the only habitat of civilization from the&nbsp;&nbsp; devastation of the destructive 
	angels.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The other part is but very soundy. It seems unclear and 
	low to our ears. It is too tough to detect the character of word. Even it 
	may lead an inattentive to be cheated. But our ears are busy to identify the 
	meaning. We know the tidbits of words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our forefathers have taught us 
	previously. It is to be listened as some soft and juicy matters produce 
	sound being collided against some hard rocks.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We become able to justify the sound correctly. It blows 
	cool fear in our mind like a ghostly touch. Then we strive hard to keep us 
	normal. We continue to imagine us safe as we observe a lion standing outside 
	of a cage in a zoo. At last our nerves obey our instructions. With the

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">

	<font face="Verdana">“I am busy in studying the history of anti autocrat 
	movement So far as it is known; the first voice of the creation against 
	autocracy was of Satan – Devil Lucifer. The words of Zamil create special 
	neural feelings. Is he speaking mad? But he bears no sign of irregularities 
	in his face. It is rather enlightened with the glow of thoughtfulness then 
	we turn bound to analyze his words .We try to memorize the background of the 
	making of Devil form Lucifer.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The commandment declared- “This man made of earth is my 
	representative. You all bow down!” Lucifer who had uttered the name of God 
	for fifty thousand years like an endless spring of water and for which he 
	had achieved the leadership for the angels stood immovable. This commandment 
	appeared to be limitless burning of shame because he had already developed 
	the sense of self respect. But God marked this audacity as an unforgiving 
	misdeed and banished him from the heaven for ever. Lucifer got&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Faruk contacted with the sensitive issue before me. He 
	wanted to strengthen the foundation of Zamil’s reasoning “Yet having all the 
	good qualities God is a dictator. He doesn’t realize any appeal. He only 
	understands unconditional surrender. If He likes followers at His fingers 
	end He may create robot. Then why did He create animal of thoughts?”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">A part of my mind wished to support their view 
	earnestly. But a merciless finger came upward through&nbsp;&nbsp; tissue of my tongue. 
	A hereditary belief of blood-run generations. “This is not the way to speak 
	It is mechanically simple. That means…..” I kept the word- error silent. 
	Afterwards I circled the matter in another way-“Try to think about the wall. 
	This wall has been saving the race for millions of years. It happens only at 
	the generosity of God!”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">If so then why did He create the deadly force? Why did 
	He let the beast power stand against the civilization? Why didn’t He allow 
	the race to run freely to the heaven, earth and the underworld collectively?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">I remain silent, thoughtful. The destructive force are 
	sharpening their piercing nails the other side of the wall. They desire to 
	root the race out of the universe. Who has planted this unmixed hatred in 
	their mind? And who has enabled them with such a horrible power? </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Again we looked at the wall keeping silence. Along with 
	billions of fellow forces they use their sharp tongues as weapons to decay 
	the wall. By sunset the wall will turn into a thin barricade. It will be 
	just as thick as papyrus. Nevertheless God continues to show kindness to 
	earthen men as an endless stream of pity. Before the next sun the wall will 
	be repaid its mountain form again </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Just then a sound of sabotage reaches our ears.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">No other being ever steps in this valley nearing the 
	wall. No plants grow here either due to some unknown orders. Barren aridness 
	is visible everywhere. No sound we hear except ours. Only a sound of licking 
	stones other side. Doubtless any different sound gives birth to some special 
	significance.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We activate our hearing machine like a deer. This sense 
	becomes ready to catch sounds as radar. Then the sound arrives again. We can 
	guess the nature and possible origin. The sound is metallic. Some metal has 
	stricken the stone of the wall but we all know that the force of destruction 
	is quite ignorant about the performance of metal. They use no limbs except 
	tongue to break wall.&nbsp; We understand instantly some of our race are 
	sabotaging against us. Some want to enhance obstacle against the progress of 
	civilization. They have come forward to make a way for the force.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Our blood moves fast full of contempt. We rush 
	breathlessly towards the source.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Crossing two turns our eyes find them. Our assumption 
	is not wrong at all. A group of people is there with spade and crowbar. Our 
	idea is accurate.&nbsp; Yet we think ourselves, we wished our idea would be 
	wrong.&nbsp; Instead of hatred a sense of crisis obstacles our breathing. They 
	are human beings! Born and grown up with food, water and air of this nature! 
	They enjoy all the privileges of civilization! Why do they desire to destroy 
	their own race? Hatred, anger, disbelief, hesitation awake for few moments 
	and lead us to be the victim, of senselessness. .&nbsp; Presently we can 
	experience the curse of such paralyzed period. One of them struck the 
	crowbar over the unprotected head of Zamil. Another one threw the spear 
	strongly. We could only see a deadly reflection. A second later we could see 
	a longitudinal line stood at the place of Zamil. He seemed immovable for a 
	moment!&nbsp; Then he fell down on the ground like the groaning of civilization.&nbsp; 
	By this time Faruk jumped over the opponent with his weapon. I picked up the 
	arms too. But my right hand betrayed me absolutely. At such necessity it 
	surrendered to paralysis. One spear was running towards the back of&nbsp; Faruk&nbsp; 
	I tried to resist it like a fool. But my hand moved so slowly. Deceiving my 
	resistance it pierced through Faruk’s back fully. My brain started to work 
	actively. It could provide proper signal then. Breaking the long records of 
	coward ness I began to rush towards the locality. My senses were being given 
	due alarm. I was running fast ringing bells like fire brigade on the 
	highway. I need to reach the human area.&nbsp; There remains the way of 
	resistance&nbsp; </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">After the erection of the wall the nation Yazoo Mazuj 
	banished their voice. No one one can utter any other sound. They know only 
	one sound- the sound of licking stone with their tongues. They don’t know 
	how long they have to do this job. They can understand only the sunrise, 
	sunset and this wall. Their only job is to break the wall. There remains 
	infinite happiness outside. The only one goal. They are digging the wall 
	with this single hope. Starting with the sunrise and ending with the sunset. 
	Generations after generations. Billions of years are continuing. Crores of 
	tongues are working with the same rhythm. The sunrise obsesses them with 
	giant’s force. But the sunset turns them into new born babies. The huge wall 
	becomes a thin paper necessitating last licking. Their tiredness rejects 
	their last attempt. Sleep prevails upon them up to the next sun. They wake 
	up again with great hope though the wall has already regained its original 
	thickness- so unbreakable. This deceiving wall can’t dishearten them. Rather 
	it doubles their zest/wrath. They return to the same work forming more

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Today’s sunrise appears quite different. It is 
	spreading some reddish smile. A kind of outrageous passion enters their 
	feelings manifold. The passion is of course known to them from the starting. 
	The passion is their working force. With the positive gesture of the sun 
	they jump over the mischievous barrier. Suddenly there arrives an unfamiliar 
	sound before all. The nation Yazuj Mazuj stops for a moment. Is it 
	forbidden? A commandment to proceed? They hesitate a moment/bit. A little 
	later the passion enhances their whim. All the suspicion, doubts and 
	hesitation vanish away. Having newer inspiration they gear up their routine 
	work.&nbsp; The sound arrives from the other side. It is continuous. It is

	<font face="Verdana">Actually he has no more tales to tell.&nbsp; A few local 
	fairy tales ever heard and some tricks of dervishes and fakirs, stories of 
	notorious dacoits and the incident of seeing Zinnah with his own eyes. And 
	the fabulous activities of the mad king. These are his capitals. Utilizing 
	these resources he has picked out insects from the ears of the people living 
	in the small town nearly 20 years. Before that he had been driving a horse 
	cart for more twenty years. The death of his old horse could not enable him 
	to afford another one. Again among the seven sons and two daughters two sons 
	have started earning. The eldest could not support him even with a paisa. 
	The son earns in a peculiar way. He was sent to Doyagram to study in a 
	madrasha. He stayed in a Lillah Boarding where he lived free of cost. Like 
	today the madrashas were run with the money collected as weekly 
	contributions, selling of cattle skins sacrificed in the Eid and the 
	donations dropped in the wooden box moving from market to market.&nbsp; The son 
	had also adopted talbelemship (apprenticeship to religious preacher) but few 
	years later he returned home with some doa-kalam (sermons) and the learning 
	of being a passive partner of sex. From that time he continues this strange 
	occupation in a hotel. How can Paran Sheikh take money from such a son for 
	living! However his second son is much better. He works in a biri factory as 
	its workman.&nbsp; He is a little master. His earning is also satisfactory. And 
	Paran Sheikh’s wife has been working as a part time paid maid servant in 
	some of the houses nearby for long. So after the death of the old horse, 
	Paran does not engage himself to any permanent occupation. However he 
	performs two works regularly. One is to distribute shirni (sacrificed food 
	items for the performers or the poor) after the Zumma prayer every Friday 
	and the other is to tell his ever told stories. Now all his sons have 
	started to earn with the blessing of Allah and got married. He needs not to 
	be starved if he receives one handful of waste food from each son seven 
	times a day. But it did not happen so. After getting married all the sons 
	scattered. They could manage to marry three daughters off somehow. Now they 
	are two along with one daughter. His wife is still capable of doing on pay. 
	To speak the truth the wife is running the family single handed. Paran 
	Sheikh is fully carefree. A bit tension sometimes arises when he thinks 
	about the younger daughter. If she is married off he can live or die in 
	relief.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Sometimes many attentive listeners gather in the 
	village tea stall. Paran Sheikh can pass most of his time sitting on the 
	bench of the stall. His lips remain auto open- Is there any taste of tea at 
	present! How can it be? The milk is impure. Some mix water, some mix powder 
	and some soak butter. If the mad king were alive!&nbsp; He was a king indeed! How 
	can a tea seller see him! He is just a new offspring! If the mad king were 
	alive! One day he heard some milkmen were pouring water in the milk. He 
	himself went to the market. Soldiers and guard were along with him. Eight 
	ducks were also with him. The ducks touched their beaks over the jars. Oh! 
	The beaks were given by Allah! What a magic! They sipped the milk. There 
	left only water at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The king ran furious. He wished to kill all 
	the culprits pressing them under the feet of elephants. Then who could see 
	them! All were rolling on ground and begging for life. The mad king however 
	forgave them. They committed never to mix water into milk again. No mercy if 
	they would do the same crime. The death under the feet of elephant. </font>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">And the king's elephant! It was truly an elephant. Its 
	color was like cloud. A true mountain. An incident to be asserted. It was an 
	incident of the then Darjeeling Mail. That train did not stop here. 
	Whistling coo near the station the train crossed the town- zhak zhak zhak. 
	The king told the English Sahib twice to have a stoppage. No result. One day 
	that elephant appeared. It stood on the rail way. Go across the king’s area, 
	train, go. Let us see how you can approach! The time was passing! The Sahib 
	bent down on the feet of the king. The stoppage was confirmed from that day. 
	The king got abroad the train grandly. Darjeeling in every summer. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">With the utterance of station the name of Zinnah came 
	to his mind. One day Zinnah Sahib addressed at the station. So thin and 
	sticky body with such spirit! Paran Sheikh has seen him with his own eyes! 
	He could understand Urdu but he saw him himself. The station still bears the 
	testimony! It is a minerat like the phallus of Shiva surrounded by chains 
	and columns. Some words are inscribed on the body of the tower-Belief- 
	Unity-Discipline. Bangla and Urdu though the letters are no more visible 
	now. Colored posters of movies cover them always.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">After talking so long a cup of tea and a stick of 
	cigarette can be enjoyed. Leaving the bench the waiter of the stall went to 
	the oven. This time three young men arrive. They are soundy as the youth 
	move now days. Two of them look branded as notorious. They have studied at 
	best up to college level. Knowing that education would carry no return, they 
	have left it. Now they do politics bearing some reputation also. They 
	collect tolls, attend processions, and burst crackers. Their arrival turns 
	the boy and&nbsp; Paran Sheikh scared. It is quite natural.&nbsp; The three do not 
	have any attention about others.&nbsp; The sitters were also alert expecting some 
	misdeeds to happen though they make fun over their activities once. It has 
	become a daily affair now. The third of them seems rather submissive with a 
	slightly shrewd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appearance. Having ordered for three cups of tea, they 
	sat on a bench. They forced the boy to wash the cups well with hot water. 
	One of them asked the third how many persons he has castrated this day.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Now it is understood that the third one is a field 
	worker of the Family Planning Department. It is his duty to persuade the 
	public for vasectomy and legation. He uttered a number laughing. The other 
	two retorted if the number is so less they may go with him to be prostrated. 
	It may earn some money and lungi. The boy tries to knob the Philips so 
	popular a radio brand. A nosy tune came out. Then a Rabindra shangeet. One 
	shouted to stop the radio. Damn the song of Tagore! Being a field worker one 
	bursts out in laughter as he reminds an incident. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">While asked about the cause he informs, Rabindranath 
	was the fourteenth son of his parents. If there were the system of 
	castrating the father must have thought that two children would be enough 
	and he would castrate. Then what the singers would do today! The other two 
	youths even Paran Sheikh himself giggled at his words. Regarding the 
	situation easy, Paran Shiekh wishes to interfere. He knows a special story 
	about a Baul singer that he can serve now. But the youths turn to another 
	issue. A hartal (strike) is ahead. An opposition cadre was doing too much in 
	the last hartal. This time one promises also to push a cocktail into his 
	prostrate. Others are in vehement criticism against the police officer. He 
	is not eligible even for the post of a night guard! Finishing their tea, 
	they fire cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The attack comes on suddenly. Six young men clearly of 
	opposition rushed towards them forming storm. The hurried movements of the 
	three flung the tables and chairs. With horrified sobbing, terrified eyes, 
	and trembling limbs the boy and Paran Shiekh came near. The three were 
	rushing out just like thrown arrows. But one was caught. He tried to escape 
	desperately. Even a hard thing can be achieved with an utmost strive. He 
	could do it too though his shirt was torn. The six followed them abusing 
	fiercely.&nbsp; A cocktail was exploded. Within a few seconds all the running 
	youths vanished away moving to the turn. There floated only cloudy ash and 
	smoke on the air. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Paran Shiekh observed he had no strength in his knee. 
	He had to remain sitting. With his trembling body he proceeded to turn it 
	straight half bent. At this he could see the watch.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Paran Sheikh passed two days in obsession.&nbsp; Hiding the 
	watch inside the fold of lungi he brought it to his room. He placed into the 
	box of tin. He told none of the matter. Even his daughter could not see his 
	opening the box. If she saw, she would think that he was taking money saved 
	by her mother. He realized it for the first time that he had power to keep 
	anything secret. But he felt unrest whether he would return it to the owner 
	or hide it. It might work well at the time of marriage of his younger 
	daughter. He fancied the bride and the unseen bridegroom. The daughter wept 
	covering her face with the scurf. A weeping for happiness! She saluted the 
	relatives-elderly persons quickly. As soon as the bridegroom completed his 
	saluting, Paran Sheikh put the watch round his wrist as a gift. All the 
	guests were astonished. The daughter too. So worthless a man like him could 
	collect such a precious object! Paran Sheikh enjoyed the bewilderment of 
	all. It is possible, sons, possible even for a worthless person can do 
	miracle. Much worthy man can fail at times while a negligible person like 
	Paran Sheikh can do it! The story of the king’s elephant and the idle ganja 
	addict can be asserted now.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The king declared- the man who can lift the elephant on 
	air will be awarded ten thousand taka. The then ten thousand means more than 
	a million at present. Within a few moment of drum beating, hundreds of bulky 
	fighters, mahut and master athletes of circus parties arrived there. One 
	drag the elephant this way, another pulled the other. Some applied tricks 
	and devices. But all in vain. The elephant sat idly in the middle of the 
	square and chewed banana tree. The crowd gathered around and enjoyed their 
	funny activities. No one could do it. At last a bony man came forward taking 
	opium. The soldiers and the crowd giggled out at his boastful attempt.&nbsp; He 
	came near the elephant indifferently. He also moved round the elephant. He 
	breathed a long spell of smoke of the pipe uttering- Boam Shankor. Then he 
	moved round again and rolled out his sleeve. The crowd laughed at his stick 
	like skinny hands. Then the addict pushed the hand under the belly of the 
	elephant.&nbsp;&nbsp; With another hand he held the testes of the elephant tightly. No 
	sooner had he pressed it than the elephant sprang up above seven Hands! So 
	the reward was his. Taka ten thousands! </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The next proclamation of the king was to make the 
	elephant express ‘Yes and No’. ‘Yes’ means the elephant would move its head 
	up and down and ‘No’ means the moving of head right and right and left. The 
	reward was the same as before. Taka ten thousand. There came numbers of 
	fakirs, peers, dervishes and magicians. Some blew uttered charms and 
	incantations. Some sprinkled blessed water. Some jumped with shouts. The 
	peers’ miracles ended, the magicians’ spells ended. But all in vain. The 
	elephant remained very calm. The crowd reveled at them cost-free. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Seven days later there came the addict again. With the 
	huge cash he received earlier he looked more confident. He had no want then 
	to buy opium. He was enjoying it more and more. He turned more slender. He 
	wore a newly bought shirt dazzling in color. This time no one laughed at 
	him. He proceeded towards the elephant stubbornly. Reaching to its ear, the 
	man whispered “Hi- elephant, can you recognize me? My action on your 
	scrotum?&nbsp; The elephant looked very afraid. It turned the eyes up and down. 
	Again the addict said- Will I press again?&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of the elephant seemed 
	out of cage- Can such pressure on scrotum be ever enjoyed? The elephant 
	started to move right and left in horror. The game was finished with reward 
	too. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Like the opium taker Paran Sheikh was not counted 
	before.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">But after dreams comes the fear in full form. If the 
	youth came back in search of the watch or if he came to know that Paran 
	Sheikh engulfed the precious thing, he would kill him. He passed his days 
	restlessly- what to do then? He thought himself unable to do anything. One’s 
	idea was not enough to take any decision. Even after passing two sleepless 
	nights one early morning Paran Sheikh prepared himself to tell the story to 
	his wife. At that time she was getting ready to go other’s house for work. 
	Thinking that Paran Sheikh was composing another story, she snarled 
	vehemently. Here tales are called precepts and the person who uses to say 
	such a story loses everything in his life. With this local proverb the wife 
	tried hard to dishearten the husband. But Paran Sheikh was helpless. He had 
	to take the decision. So he opened his inside with struggle. At first she 
	remained reluctant to hear but when she realized the matter she reacted 
	sharply. The anemic face lost the even the last drop of blood. She was 
	terrified inwardly. She was passing her life with such a husband! Though she 
	showed a kind of negligence to him, she kept a great compassion for him too. 
	She turned stunned about the safety of her foolish husband. She retorted 
	several times to reback the watch and beg pardon. This would be the only 
	solution to avoid such a danger ahead. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Next day Paran Sheikh ploughs the whole arena to pick 
	out the gang walking but in vain. He finds none of them. On return he again 
	seeks the way from his wife. He decides to go to the house of the leader. 
	This is the first time for him. In the poster he has seen his photograph 
	only. During the vote. He has heard the speeches of the leader from the 
	microphones at rallies. The leader announces- doors of my house are always 
	open to all irrespective of classes. Reaching the yard of his house he sees 
	peoples are entering and coming out. No obstacle is found. The leader won’t 
	sit anymore. No one will meet him now. Probably Paran Sheikh has heard about 
	it but nothing can influence on so obsessed a person like him. More ever the 
	open surroundings have encouraged him much. Crossing the entrance he finds 
	different form of rooms. Reaching one room he stands wondered- an uncommon 
	darkness prevails over the atmosphere. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">There is a glass room inside the hall. Light comes out 
	through the glass. In fact it is a colossal aquarium covering half of the 
	space. Various colored fishes are swimming in the red-blue-green-yellow 
	light. A heavenly situation of light and shade persists there. The fishes 
	are moving out of sheer joy. The leader looks at them meditating. 
	Indifferent to all. This is completely his own world. The world of sports. 
	The game is just a part. At times the leader retouches him from others only 
	to concentrate on the play. The sixth sense of Paran Sheikh alerts him to 
	keep silence. He stands motionless as if he were the soundless air. Moments 
	are passing wordless. The leader still observes the moving fishes. He 
	follows the timer of his mind.&nbsp; Once it signals. The second round will 
	start. He picks up a (fish) from a covered pan. He raises it before his 
	face. With red eyes it stares at the leader steadily for few moments as 
	though it regained power radiated from his soul. He lifts the cover of the 
	aquarium and leaves it. For a while the fish hangs as an unmovable sharpened 
	arrow in the water. Just then it jumps over the red blue fishes. The eyes of 
	the leader are sparking. The skin of his face becomes turns oily with the 
	sweating of passion. A secretion of some unknown hormone is going on in his 
	body. When the mouth of the fish opens, a sudden shrill sound – Ah- O – O is 
	produced through the tongue of the leader. Paran Sheikh feels trembling. It 
	seems some supernatural beings have come down. He stands spellbound. He has 
	lost the least power of movement.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">After devouring the last one the ---- floats in the 
	crystal water with red eyes opened. Fixed as if it were a mine grounded 
	under sea water. Now the leader breathes satisfactorily. Turning back he 
	sees the old, unknown man. His brews react first. A kind of boredom touches 
	the body. Yet he has a great strength of mind! He hides the sign of anger 
	quickly. A soothing smile spreads over his face. All the muscles are quite 
	habituated. Coming forward he puts his hands softly over the shoulder of 
	Paran Sheikh. A mode of encouragement. It provides a great relief to Paran 
	Sheikh. He has then reached to a just place! The incident or the need or the 
	help the leader can do- this type of question is always expressed and 
	instantly Paran Sheikh evaporates fully telling his problem with the watch.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The leader hears everything quietly. He bears an 
	empowering view all the time though his brain turns active inwardly. A prey 
	has come to the web himself. He can easily be used.&nbsp; Paran Sheikh can’t 
	understand, the Paran Sheikhs can’t understand there persists an octopus 
	behind such look. The octopus does not have any other sense except 
	possessing the victim.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The assuring look takes a form of speech this time. 
	Paran Sheikh could know that he had nothing to be afraid of. He needs not 
	return the watch. No one even demands it back. No one threats him ever. The 
	only return is to do a simple work.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">He is now greatly relieved. His knees now feel very 
	weak after a long crisis. If he can sit! </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The leader can read insight. He lets him sit on the 
	soft sofa very affectionately.&nbsp; Paran Sheikh's heart melts away. For such a 
	great leader he can do anything. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Well - let the work be known. The leader starts 
	talking; Paran Sheikh can use the watch himself. He is asked if he knows how 
	to measure time. Observing the moving compasses of the huge clock in the 
	porch of the court he has guessed them beforehand. But he can't understand 
	the English writing seen on the watch.&nbsp; The leader comes forward again with 
	assurance-He will teach him how to identify time. He is to be given another 
	timer having two hands too. He is to be posted to sit somewhere He will stay 
	in a tea stall before a house of some leader- sworn enemy to his new but 
	dear master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Few persons are needed to be known only. He will pass 
	his time in the stall, enjoy free tea-cigarettes, tell tales and mark when 
	the leader enters and exits. It is so easy a task. Naturally there prevails 
	no reason to deny the job. One day Paran sheikh starts his occupation.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">One month goes. Goes the second month too. Gaping only 
	a few days' two persons were murdered in the town. As a protest processions 
	are held, strikes are observed. The town cools down as usual. Paran Sheikh 
	continues. His wife cleans dishes, sweeps floors with wet clothes from house 
	to house. She manages her meals as before. She also keeps rice and curry on 
	a plate for her husband. Sometimes Paran sheikh eats sometimes refuses. The 
	wife turns angry to see his reluctance over so hard earned food.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Once a day passes. Second day passes. Also begins the 
	third day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paran sheikh does not return. The wife gets nervous. She starts 
	to have information about her husband. Having heard from different people 
	she reaches the tea stall. The owner informs- Paran Sheikh has not been 
	there for the last two days. She continues searching the days onward. She 
	goes to all possible places where he was used to tell tales. No where is 
	Paran Sheikh.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The wife weeps before the sons. With her rapid 
	insistence they come out to look for their unnecessary father. To search so 
	deceivingly they become annoyed too. But with no result their irritation 
	feels another apprehension. Keeping their heads cool they counsel together. 
	They decide to go to the leader. But he is in the capital. None of his party 
	workers can help them- They haven't seen the sign of Paran Sheikh for few 
	days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The sons stop searching. But their mother! She runs 
	indifferent to works. She enquires the whole day. Arranging rice on plate 
	she waits for her husband. Fear, anxiety, excessive labor, hazards of 
	sleeplessness all add to her tiredness. Everything makes her stupefied. If 
	she sits, drowsiness attacks her, dozing appears. And whenever she is 
	stooping, she finds her husband. Paran sheikh is engulfing mouthful rice and 
	telling the tales.For few days he has been uttering the name of his leader- 
	the model of all leaders. A born leader. He rears a large tabula fish in a 
	watered box. He talks in a soft voice as tender as butter. If he is ever 
	angry, he never raises his voice. His tongue simply becomes grave and if he 
	speaks, a thunder of roaring clouds appears. When he looks at his fellows, 
	they pass urine terrified. When he roars pregnant women leave their wombs 
	off. What about the eyes of the leader! Whom or what do they look like? No 
	simile is born yet.&nbsp; But it is true he is a leader! He rears a tabula fish

	village she could walk day night easily as her other senses worked well. 
	Going to their houses she inspired- Come, dear wives, come we’ll face 
	together.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her presence those ladies got assurance 
	to hold a meeting. They went out to find out their men. They needn’t go far. 
	It was the public square where they decided to plant banyan tree. A woman of 
	perfect beauty was dancing in the midst of their men. Her gesture created 
	some unearthly rays, whenever she place her artful steps, the rhythm of 
	tabla and music took a new turn. Looking at her the men ran wordless, 
	obedient and bound as students listen to their teacher’s command. The 
	village women burst out in grievance. The united shrieks covered all the 
	spells of tabla and jingle of bells. The very woman stopped her dance. The 
	charm was over. The husbands were nervous before their furious wives. But 
	the wives did not pay attention to them. They accused the dancer first. They 
	attempted to tear the seducer. Ghnuteburi was again in the lead. Why did she 
	bring a dung cake with her? The question was useless. But she threw it at 
	the charmer. How strange! On the air it turned into a red rose! The rose 
	stroke her baby softly and dropped like some fervent offering to an alter. 
	All their attacking spirits cooled. Being astonished they thought- It is 
	either an witch or some goddess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Again the old woman proceeded – Who are you? Why to 
	dance before others` husbands and take them away from their wives? Don’t you 
	fear Hell?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Her deceiving arts of&nbsp; eyes which engulfed the men’s 
	heart earlier had already disappeared. Instead, there reflected flashes of 
	hapless pains, She said piteously- I’m a yakshasi (demi goddess to guard 
	hidden treasure). In a banyan tree I live only to worship yakkhas. He can 
	save me. But there is no banyan tree here. Then why did you come? </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">I understand your willpower. Meditating your wishes I 
	understood that a banyan tree is going to link its root to the netherworld 
	and spread its branches to the blue sky. Therefore I came here to be seated 
	and placed. From here I’ll worship yakkhi.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Ghnuteburi was not a woman to stop so early. She spoke 
	on metallic tune –Well. It’s all right. Take your position here. But explain 
	us why you made these men so charmed and their houses so deserted. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Yakkhi was full of pathos still- I didn’t call them 
	out. They found me here last night. I’m helpless before man. My spell 
	doesn’t work on them at all.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Why did you dance before them if you have no charm? You 
	could dance invisibly.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">I can hide my body at daylight not at night. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We understand it. But we couldn’t let you dance 
	anymore. You would attract the man folk whole night. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Yakkhi looked lifeless –I’ve nothing to do if I like to 
	save myself. As long as I dance the men will remain spell bound. If I stop 
	they’ll devour my flesh and bone. I need to dance till to the sunrise even 
	if my toes bleed. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">At this the female heart felt pity for her. They blamed 
	their outrageous husbands. They assured Yakkhi – we’re taking your 
	responsibility. No man can touch you anyhow.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The yakshasi got relieved – Give me security only for 
	this night. Bengama- Bengami ( taletell birds ) will take over next night. 
	They are to be placed here too. They’ll look after me. With their safety 
	I’ll continue my worshipping attentively.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The sapling was planted duly. The village faced acute 
	shortage of water. Yet the women brought it from far only to help the young 
	tree . They even rationed their children’s water supply. They used less 
	water for household works. They sent their cattle to other pargana . They 
	did all these works only to water the sapling. But what a reverse result it 
	ensured! They poured water everyday but the young tree turned pale and 
	nearly dead next morning. The woman tried their utmost but with same 
	consequence! The well planted sapling welcomed them with so pitiful 
	appearance.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Ghnuteburi began to scream ceaselessly- It is the men 
	who must have designed some conspiracy. Somehow they pour poison at the root 
	at night. Who are the night faring culprits? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">No result followed.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Ghnuteburi posted guards with earthen lamps. But for 
	what change! The regiment reported – Nobody crossed their eyes the whole 
	night.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;What to do then? The women could not decide. They 
	said- Let us consult with the ghnuteburi and continue our watch.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The women could not help talking always. Her hours were 
	not passing without any happening .Though the women had no interest in her 
	incessant talking, they appeared before her for their common battle. The old 
	woman flashed suddenly- What’ll happen if I keep the cat in the spot? </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">She hurried home and returned with the pet in her lap.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">What a magical reaction! The banyan sapling began to 
	shake terribly as if thunderstorm was blowing over it. The atmosphere was 
	too calm. The cat seemed restless. It wished to jump on something unknown.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Hardly had it got scope, it reached the tree in a 
	second. It dug the ground near the sapling. The women were at a loss. What 
	was happening?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The sapling stopped shivering a little later. The cat 
	came back to her owner. It caught four rats. It was&nbsp; the fact then! The 
	mates were so wicked! They let rats under ground, only to cut the natal 
	roots not to collect water.&nbsp; What more vile tricks the men can take!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The sapling grew up in full awing. It touched the 
	sphere and dropped its aerial roots to the earth. The sapling now became 
	full grown,&nbsp; matured banyan tree. The village woman made it another duty. 
	They went to the tree everyday. They experienced devotion of the lonely 
	Yakkhi for Yakkhas. What a noble love! It also enhanced their affection for 
	their husbands. With more affection and vow they served the men. But the&nbsp; 
	husbands ran more gloomy. They tried hard to avoid the trees as plagues.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The wives&nbsp; was deeply concerned – why are you so 
	indifferent to the plant? The tree&nbsp; speaks of our past. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Which past?.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We know nothing. We can’t remember. We can only realize 
	it’s not a happy past. It’s heart rending, </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">It’s a sin done previously. But we can’t memorize it. 
	This tree will make us jatishwar(one who reminds past lives) As long as it 
	remains silent we are safe.- the men sighed,</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">But how can you say so? Why do you take the sin on your 
	own shoulders what you didn’t do?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We needn’t be worry about it. But this tree indicates 
	we are to repent. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Well, we may share your suffering. Better think about 
	the kind of the past sinful act. If we attach together we can redeem from 
	the punishment.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">This kind of sin never ends in suffering, only in 
	death….. the men stopped. They kept themselves away from their wives.</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their hearts were burning </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">One day they went to the birds- you are onlooker of 
	all. O seer, you know the past, the present and the future, please let us 
	know how the banyan tree increases our dejection.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The talkative birds seemed somewhat disturbed- we can’t 
	foretell the future. We assert about the past unadulterated matters.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Was the past sinful? Not pure? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The birds kept silent. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Speak. Speak,</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The sin was not theirs’. Yet they took the charge on 
	them as Jesus did for the whole mankind, </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">At this the women felt a bit jubilant.- Our husbands 
	are not responsible then. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The birds said- If anybody wants to suffer other’s 
	punishment, and if he declares it openly, he’ll not like to share it with 
	other. It is human mind.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">We are inseparable part of our husbands. They fulfill 
	all our wants. They must permit us to share in the process of redemption. If 
	we take part, their miseries would be light. Tell us birds. Please. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Their quests received several refusals. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">At last the bird agreed.-Then listen to me. Prepare 
	your mind. Your past may break your heart. It’ll trouble the tongues, wet 
	the eyes. So terrible, so melancholic the incident was.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Once upon a time there was a kingdom here. A king’s 
	palace was also in the village. The villagers knew the king lived inside. He 
	was treated as the saver and God’s sole representative for the people, The 
	rural people were taught this as a truth by the preacher. They paid some 
	parts of crops, cattle, fishes as their gifts. The king in return provided 
	security for them. But no subjects had ever seen the king except his 
	generals, soldiers and collectors. Even his employees couldn’t see him. They 
	received only orders and delivered it to the subjects. They explained there 
	was another palace inside where the monarch lived alone. But no one was 
	permitted to go there, even not his servants. The gate was opened on the 
	ringing of the doorbell. His employees only put the presentations before the 
	gate. An invisible voice made them know the king’s order. However they all 
	knew the trespasser met his death unquestionably.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Within one year the total Pargana met with a severe 
	draught. Crops didn’t grow. The fields were burnt with the piercing 
	sunlight. Water of rivers, lakes, and ponds dried up. Fishes and cattle were 
	finished. Mothers couldn’t feed their babies.&nbsp; They lost all prospects. How 
	to save their dear children? Many of them had already died. One day they 
	decided they would go to the king. Every year they presented the king many 
	things. Some of them must be deposited in the king’s treasure. More ever the 
	king must come forward to diminish their distress as he is God’s agent on 
	earth. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">One day they went to the palace. The soldiers opened 
	the first gate. But the iron gate remained closed. A voice was on the air – 
	No man can enter. Send your women.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The women didn’t wish to go in. they were filled with 
	fear. But when the children in their lap cried for food, they could do what? 
	They proceeded slowly. They dared cross the ever forbidden gate. At the time 
	of entering they remembered- Nobody returns. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Yet they stepped in. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Next day huge dishes of food were brought before the 
	villagers. Fragrance of cooked foods spread out in the air of the village. 
	The rural people never enjoyed such delicious meat! So tasty and so much in 
	quantity! Day after day they ate them to their hearts content.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Afterwards, they noticed their wives had not returned 
	yet, they went to the iron gate. The soldiers informed- No entry. You can 
	not go inside. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The men insisted the soldiers to let them go. The gate 
	was very hard. But the men had been already bold with food. They held 
	terrific force in them. They broke the gate.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;But what is it! Where is the king?&nbsp; There stands only 
	a bansai. As soon as they went before the bansai, it began to spread its 
	branches in all directions. It expanded and turned into a sky touching 
	banyan tree. There&nbsp; hung innumerable skeletons in the branches as the nests 
	of weavers. The tree roared – It’s I who is your king. The skeletons are of 
	your women’s. First the blood and then the skeletons I have taken. And their 
	meat was for you.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">At this point loud lamentation filled the atmosphere. 
	Instead of the women the men were wailing.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">The women didn’t know when the men came to the spot.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">Now we can recognize our sin. We ate our mothers’ meat. 
	Sin! Oh the vicious sin! We can remember we have to redeem now!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">
	<font face="Verdana">In one dark night the wives found their husbands were 
	not in their beds. None said anything yet they were certain their husbands
