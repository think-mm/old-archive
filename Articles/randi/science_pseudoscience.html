              <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Every time I 
              glance at the shelf in the JREF library that holds only the ten 
              books I've written — substantially enlarged by the different 
              editions in other languages and formats that have ensued, 
              presently 28&quot; of books — I'm aware that all of that combined 
              doesn't add up to one of Carl Sagan's books in respect to the 
              erudition and expertise that is represented there. Carl — and Dick 
              Feynman, Stephen Gould, Martin Gardner, Isaac Asimov, Richard 
              Dawkins, and so many others I've known — all were able to organize 
              their thoughts and their words far more eloquently than I have 
              ever managed. I'm awed by that, and with that fact in mind I lose 
              no opportunity to get to my keyboard and record my thoughts before 
              the inevitability of time catches up with me. I estimate that I 
              have two more books in me. Perhaps quantity will substitute for 
              scholarship. </p>
              <p>As I promised — or threatened — last week, I'm offering you 
              here just a simple essay I jotted down a while back. I felt it 
              might interest you, and perhaps give you some ammunition when the 
              grubbies assail you with their nonsense. This is only my own 
              personal view expressed, I'm a layman, and I urge you not to take 
              this as being definitive. I'm sure it can be improved upon, 
              substantially. Here it is…. </p>
              <p><b><font color="#ff0000">SCIENCE PSEUDOSCIENCE: THE 
              DIFFERENCES.</font></b> </p>
              <p>I'm often asked for my personal definition of &quot;science,&quot; and I 
              usually limit it to this: Science is an organized, disciplined, 
              unbiased search for knowledge of the world around us. Given the 
              opportunity, I hasten to add to this my observations that science 
              does not discover &quot;facts,&quot; but rather it finds statements 
              (theories, formulae, descriptions) as a result of having examined 
              the real world, statements that describe what may be expected to 
              be found under stated conditions. And, just as importantly, 
              science is always prepared to adjust, reverse, abandon, and/or 
              add/subtract to/from its statements, in order to more closely 
              approach &quot;the truth.&quot; Obviously, we can always go on from there to 
              define &quot;truth,&quot; which I regard as an unreachable goal (truth, not 
              the definition) — though in spite of Zeno's Paradox, we do 
              eventually and essentially get there. But let's not examine <i>
              that</i> can of worms…. </p>
              <p>Science and pseudoscience are exact opposites, as are 
              rationality and religion. Science, as a working method, employs 
              basic principles such as objectivity and accuracy to establish a 
              finding. It often also uses certain admitted assumptions about 
              reality, assumptions that must eventually support themselves and 
              be proven, or the resulting finding fails verification. 
              Pseudoscience, however, uses invented modes of analysis which it 
              pretends or professes meet the requirements of scientific method, 
              but which in fact violate its essential attributes. Many obvious 
              examples of pseudoscience are easy to identify, but the more 
              subtle and therefore more insidious and convincing cases, require 
              better definitions of the attributes involved. </p>
              <p>Religion is based on blind faith; it is not evidence-based. It 
              rests on basic beliefs — dogma — that are not derived nor 
              supported by observation or by performance, but by need. It is 
              wishful thinking used to simplify everything; it requires no real 
              thinking. It survives on the need for an uncomplicated and easily 
              explained world, and prides itself on its rejection of 
              rationality. Its mascot/saint is Pollyanna. Religion eschews 
              reason, investigation, and logic, as disturbing and unwanted 
              elements of life. Religion is comforting, but also sophistic and — 
              to me — soporific. I'll have none of it. </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>For a better understanding of science, it is of primary 
              importance to realize that knowledge is advancing rapidly, in the 
              accelerating mode referred to as &quot;geometric progression.&quot; Many 
              times, what was once regarded as legitimate science has later come 
              to be viewed, and shown to be, pseudoscience. I was recently asked 
              by the ABC-TV 20/20 people for examples of science having 
              apparently &quot;proven&quot; something, and then having been forced to 
              admit that it had been wrong. This proved to be a very interesting 
              inquiry; while we still have some demonstrably erroneous ideas 
              such as &quot;cold fusion&quot; with us, certain other just-as-powerful 
              notions in the past rose and fell rather quickly. Phrenology is a 
              good example of that class, one that I offered to ABC. This was a 
              once-science that involved deducing character, abilities, and 
              proclivities by interpreting the bumps and depressions generally 
              found on the skull. It was at one time actually regarded as a 
              legitimate type of psychology, and at the JREF we have a 
              collection of more than forty books dealing with this subject. I 
              must explain that the only reason we have this extensive a section 
              in our library is that it arrived as part of a large shipment from 
              an auction purchase which contained much more valuable material. 
              Those who examine this part of our collection often join me in 
              speculating about the colossal expenditure of time and talent that 
              was squandered in creating such volumes as those shown here in our 
              illustration; books expounding on this delusion can be found on 
              our shelves in five different languages. Today, phrenology is 
              looked upon as just another device invented by naïve scientists, 
              then used by others for duping ignorant laymen. Although its 
              originators (Gall, Spurzheim, Combe) might have actually believed 
              it to be valid, certainly the subsequent practitioners had to have 
              discovered that it was nonsense. </p>
              <p>
              <img alt hspace="5" src="http://www.randi.org/images/031804-AstrologerX.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" border="0" width="200" height="272"> 
              Other once-sciences would include astrology — predicting the 
              future by the stars, palmistry — predicting a person's future and 
              character by &quot;reading the life lines&quot; on the palm, or numerology — 
              predicting one's future by interpreting the order of numbers in 
              the birth date, or the numbered-order of the letters in the name. 
              These were all at one time regarded as fairly reputable sciences, 
              and millions of words were written about them. Courses in some 
              universities were offered in these &quot;ologies,&quot; and degrees were 
              awarded. Today they are clearly defined as quackery, though such 
              bed-companions as homeopathy and chiropractic have yet to fully 
              make this transition. I'll add that astrology is still actually 
              offered as a course at the Sorbonne in Paris, at the Kepler 
              College of Astrological Arts Sciences in Lynnwood, Washington, and 
              as part of the standard curriculum at certain Indian Universities. 
              Incredible, but true…. </p>
              <p>It's comforting to know that some curious and dedicated 
              scientists have actually troubled to look into such strange 
              &quot;discoveries&quot; as &quot;polywater&quot; and &quot;N-rays,&quot; and have relegated 
              these to the trash bin — though these phenomena were both thought, 
              at one time, to be glowing examples of progress in chemistry and 
              in physics, respectively. The first was thought to be water with 
              super-wet characteristics; the evidence offered for this 
              conclusion was found to have been the result of laboratory 
              glassware with unnoticed traces of detergent present; that would 
              certainly increase the &quot;wetting ability&quot; of the contents. &quot;N-rays&quot; 
              were a finding of the French at the beginning of the last century 
              — considered by them to be a parallel discovery to the Germans' 
              Röntgen Rays which we now call &quot;X-rays.&quot; N-rays were &quot;found&quot; and 
              investigated by a very prominent and much-awarded Gallic scientist 
              (René Blondlot) who claimed that they were emitted by an amazing 
              variety of substances. They were, he said, invisible and very 
              difficult to detect and to evaluate. Indeed they were: they didn't 
              exist at all. Though some 30 scientific papers reporting 
              additional validation and characteristics of the supposed rays had 
              been issued by academics all over the world during the first few 
              months after the announcement of their birth, those reports were 
              all quietly withdrawn when the subject was found to be imaginary. 
              In both polywater and N-rays, science nicely corrected itself, as 
              it was designed to do. </p>

              Ah, but don't think that we are presently free of wrong-headed 
              notions originated by trained and accredited scientists. For 
              example, though N-rays are long gone, we now have &quot;E-rays&quot; to deal 
              with. These, discovered recently by German science, are said to 
              originate from unknown sources deep within the Earth, and cannot 
              be detected by any known scientific means — except by dowsing rods 
              and certain hand-held &quot;secret technology&quot; devices. In Europe, 
              special blankets, amulets, and other shielding devices, as well as 
              detecting &quot;meters,&quot; are sold widely to protect people from the 
              cancer-inducing effects of this mysterious radiation, and an 
              entire industry has sprung up based upon this totally spurious 
              claim. Here in the United States, we can take great pseudo-pride 
              in the discovery of &quot;cold fusion,&quot; a notion that is still 
              prevalent in some circles, joining the free-energy and 
              perpetual-motion claims that have cost countless millions of 
              research dollars that could have been usefully spent. </p>
              <p>One problem in identifying pseudoscience is that some 
              loosely-accepted methodological approaches to important questions 
              are partly scientific and partly pseudoscientific, combining 
              legitimate with illegitimate methods, inferences, and/or 
              assumptions. Two examples of this are, first, what's known as 
              naturopathy — a notion which rests partly on verified 
              physiological principles and partly on scientifically unsound 
              ideas of how the human body works, and second, what's called 
              &quot;religious science&quot; — which rests partly on objectively verified 
              psychological principles of suggestibility such as 
              &quot;mind-over-matter&quot; and partly on scientifically unconfirmed 
              notions of bodily processes such as that all illness is &quot;mental&quot; 
              and can be cured by thought alone. </p>
              <p>The general features of a pseudoscientific approach to 
              phenomena are those which ignore, deny or violate the essential 
              attributes of valid science. Among the outstanding hallmarks of a 
              pseudoscience are that: </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="times new roman, times, serif">It is illogical, 
                violating one or more of the basic rules of inference, 
                definition, argument, or proof; think of homeopathy and extreme 
                dilution. </p>
                <p>Pseudoscience is unsystematic in that its various parts do 
                not necessarily relate to and support each other. It has no 
                consistency; think of astrology vs. astronomy. </p>
                <p>It begs for suspension of some basic rules of reason and 
                established modes of examining theories and ideas, claiming 
                exemption from those &quot;outmoded&quot; procedures because of its own 
                far-reaching assumptions; think cold fusion and basic physics.
                </p>
                <p>It is usually subjective rather than objective, often relying 
                on unique personal interpretations of phenomena made by a 
                particular authority — a dogma, a Bible or its equivalent, some 
                sort of oracle, or a charismatic leader, one perceived by his or 
                her followers as having god-like qualities; think of L. Ron 
                Hubbard and Scientology, and of Mary Baker Eddy and Christian 
                Science. </p>
                <p>Pseudoscience is &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; rather than accumulative 
                and progressive; its statements are not changed to agree with 
                new evidence. The Church taught that the Sun was perfect and 
                unblemished, and condemned a real scientist such as Galileo when 
                he found it was marked with spots. They could not incorporate 
                this discovery into their view of their God's creation. </p>
                <p>One sure test of any truly scientific statement is its 
                ability to predict the future — to say what will happen under 
                given circumstances. When subjected to valid and objective 
                measures of prediction, pseudoscience performs no better in this 
                respect than does random guesswork alone, in contrast to real 
                science; think of history as predicted by astrology, compared to 
                gravity and s = ut + ½at<sup><font size="1">2</font></sup>.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Since the layman is untrained in the basic intellectual aspects 
              of science, he often cannot distinguish between legitimate 
              scientists and their imitators. All around him, every day, he 
              hears or sees apparent authorities — often with titles, genuine or 
              assumed — who exhort him to believe their assertions. The 
              resolution of this quandary is an overwhelming task for the 
              layman, for who and what is reputable — and therefore reliable — 
              in science, is a question demanding knowledge both of science in 
              general and of the particular field involved. Therefore, the 
              non-specialist is very often confused by conflicting claims made 
              in the name of science. The legitimate scientist himself, at 
              times, can be thus misled when faced with seemingly cogent 
              arguments that lie outside of his field of special knowledge. In 
              parapsychology, this is frequently found: parapsychologists — in 
              common with other scientists — are often unwilling to call in 
              specialists such as conjurers, who may very well have the 
              specialized expertise required to explain factors that would 
              otherwise not be understood — or even noticed — by the observer 
              untrained in that respect. </p>
              <p>
              <img alt hspace="5" src="http://www.randi.org/images/031804-Books.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" border="0" width="200" height="155"> 
              (Currently, my local PBS-TV stations are featuring both Dr. Wayne 
              Dyer and Dr. Gary Null in their pledging period, to take advantage 
              of the public's taste for quackery. Both these men flaunt degrees, 
              both deal in nonsense. Dyer makes incredibly naïve statements such 
              as that if you just summon up enough determination, &quot;anything is 
              possible,&quot; and Null prescribes magnets and other medieval tools to 
              prevent aging. He preaches eternal youth. Now, Null is less than 
              60 years old, but I recognize dyed hair and make-up, and he looks 
              much older even than I, a man who has 15 years on him. How could 
              that be? My guess is that PBS's most favored peddler of magic, 
              King of Quacks Deepak Chopra, is busy elsewhere selling his 
              nostrums and isn't available to PBS this season.) </p>
              <p>There is another false notion commonly held by the layman, that 
              major scientific discoveries are often the products of amateur 
              minds, and therefore that the authority of the scientist is 
              sometimes to be critically suspected. The philosophical assumption 
              of this is that the discovery of some new fact or idea is usually 
              a matter of accident, and therefore that discovery in science is 
              essentially no different than, say, the finding of a buried 
              treasure, and anyone might stumble onto a chest of doubloons 
              without having any education. While there was a time when big 
              discoveries were made by gifted individuals — think of Alexander 
              Fleming and penicillin, Marconi and radio — most developments are 
              now brought about by organized teams or committees; think of the 
              transistor and of Lunar exploration. </p>
              <p>Of course, as we have often seen, a few trained scientists are 
              simply charlatans, and a larger percentage are honestly 
              self-deluded. For any scientist to assume that because he is 
              highly educated he cannot therefore be deluded nor deceived, is a 
              grave error. The layman has much greater difficulty 
              differentiating between the real scientists and the scientists who 
              are simply — innocently — wrong and have chosen to take up 
              residence in that fabled — and increasingly crowded — Ivory Tower. 
              While a scientist in a free society has the same right as any 
              other citizen to speak out on any topic he wishes, many reputable 
              scientists choose to speak or write publicly on subjects outside 
              their established fields of accomplishment or expertise. When a 
              scientist purports to speak authoritatively outside his field of 
              knowledge, he may then be exploiting his reputation — 
              accomplishments and attributes — and playing on that reputation to 
              extend his authority in a possibly unrelated field. An academic 
              who has achieved credibility in the field of statistics cannot 
              legitimately claim that he therefore speaks authoritatively on 
              politics, nor that he is able to detect trickery. In today's 
              society, we are very accustomed to see celebrities — all too often 
              people in science — endorsing various products and services that 
              have no relationship whatsoever to their professional lives, and 
              motion picture stars sell soap and mortgage plans freely without 
              arousing very much wonder from the public about why they are found 
              on our TV screens and in our magazines performing this task. We 
              are easily blinded by glamour and reputation, which often do not 
              lend any validation whatsoever to such endorsements. This applies 
              both to movie stars and to Ph.D.s. </p>
              <p>Then, too, popular views of science are often colored by a 
              variation of Rousseau's &quot;noble savage&quot; theme — many believe that 
              modern discoveries simply had to have existed in ancient times, 
              and the further back in time, the better. They point to such 
              things as the very early — and successful — use of various 
              plant-derived substances by witchdoctors, and the very early 
              recognition by Chinese scholars of the fundamentals of integral 
              calculus — they discovered how to calculate the area of the 
              circle, but then apparently went no further with this wonderful 
              idea. While it's true that early thinkers often came upon very 
              important discoveries, it was often by accident; digitalis would 
              be an excellent example of an accidental discovery, though its 
              effects needed to be observed and then carefully recorded in order 
              to enter primitive pharmacopoeias. However, determining the area 
              of a shape that could not be simply divided into a set of 
              triangles, took a determined application of intellect and 
              curiosity. That discovery was not stumbled upon; it was purposely 
              sought out. </p>
              <p>How often I hear that gleeful cry, &quot;Science doesn't know 
              everything!&quot; or &quot;Science isn't sure of anything!&quot; thrown up to me 
              as evidence of my abysmal naivety. The exultation and jeers 
              increase when I freely admit that both those statements are very 
              true, since that admission seems to establish the imperfection of 
              science, while it does exactly the opposite. Science has never 
              claimed to &quot;know&quot; everything, or for that matter, anything, to any 
              absolute certainty. That is its glory, not its shame. It expresses 
              statements, relationships, and measurements, it predicts outcomes 
              of given circumstances, and it provides information — all of which 
              are tentative though well-founded and dependable to definable 
              degrees. We learn from what science reveals, how to handle and 
              grow within the limitations of our world, how to survive, and how 
              to convey to other generations what we have learned. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;And that is beautiful. </p>
