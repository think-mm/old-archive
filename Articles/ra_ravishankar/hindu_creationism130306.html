	&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even as the intelligent design 
	controversy rages on, California recently witnessed a concerted push by a 
	coalition of three Hindutva (Hindu supremacist) groups -- Hindu Education 
	Foundation, Vedic Foundation and the Hindu American Foundation -- to doctor 
	sixth grade social science textbooks. Their strong ideological and 
	organizational links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in India 
	makes them all the more dangerous, for any success here would provide a 
	much-needed fillip to the RSS family of organizations in India [1]. 
	Fortunately, interventions by a group of Indologists led by Professor 
	Michael Witzel and strong mobilizations by the South Asian community 
	resulted in a resounding defeat for the Hindutva groups. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As repeatedly pointed out by groups 
	at the forefront of the California struggle, the edits proposed by the 
	Hindutva groups sought to negate the &quot;great pluralism within Hindu practice, 
	as well as the religious diversity within Indian society&quot; [2]. For this 
	purpose, the Hindutva forces hired the PR firm Ruder Finn which has a 
	reputation of targeting liberals, feminists and Jews and mobilizing public 
	opinion for American intervention in the Balkans [3]. However, &quot;His 
	Divinity, Dharm Chakrvarti&quot; Swami Prakashanand Saraswati, the spiritual 
	leader of the Texas-based Vedic Foundation has dug them such a deep hole 
	that even Ruder Finn –- with all its ruthlessness -– would have a hard time 
	salvaging any respectability for its clients. Saraswati's magnum opus, &quot;The 
	true history and the religion of India&quot;, reeks of megalomania from start to 
	finish and is bound to be an embarrassment for any practicing Hindu [4].
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If Saraswati were one of those 
	dime-a-dozen Swamis, his book could have been dismissed as a failed attempt 
	at humor. However, as the Vedic Foundation’s aggressive posturing in 
	California demonstrated, they are out to mythologize history and science. In 
	the last few decades, the rationalist currents in Indian philosophy have 
	gradually been supplanted by the ideology of Hindutva and the megalomania of 
	the Vedic Foundation nicely dovetails into the Hindutva agenda [5]. What 
	follows is a fictional account of a tete-a-tete between Prakashanand 
	Saraswati and a Hindutva activist; except for questions #6 and #7, 
	Saraswati’s responses are taken almost verbatim from his book. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q1: The Western mind seems incapable 
	of comprehending the significance of our sacred places and rivers. Why would 
	anyone want to take a dip in the dirty waters of say, the river Ganges, they 
	ask [6]. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: The holy rivers or places that 
	come in the Puranas eternally exist as the Divine personalities, or the 
	Divine existences in the Divine abode of the supreme God. Their 
	representation in the from of rivers or places on the land of India is a 
	kind of holy manifestation of the Divinity on the material plane for the 
	devotional benefit of the devotees of God, just like the Vedas and the 
	Puranas are in a book form in the material world and they are in their 
	Divine form in the Divine world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q2: How different are the western 
	religions from our Bhartiya religion [7]? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: In no way could there be any 
	comparison of the western religions (which are based on mythologies) with 
	the Hindu Vedic religion which is eternal, universal and is directly 
	revealed by the supreme God. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q3: The California textbooks refer 
	to some of our sacred texts as myths ... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Divine writings cannot be 
	analyzed in a material way. How could a worldly being, possessed with the 
	vehemence of his own passions and desires, try to argue with the writings of 
	Sages and Saints whose entire life was a divine benevolence for the souls of 
	the world? You should know that all of our religious writings are Divine 
	facts, and facts always remain facts, they cannot become myths. Using the 
	word myth for our religious history is a serious spiritual transgression.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q4: In the California struggle, the 
	anti-Hindu side has gotten a lot of support from scholars and academics 
	specializing in South Asia. Is this of any consequence? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: It is a fact that in the world 
	almost all the academic literature in English about Hinduism, even by Hindu 
	writers, bears the western influence, and that, none of these books 
	represent the correct view of total authentic Hinduism. Historians forget 
	that one cannot determine the history of Bharatvarsh on meager 
	archaeological findings of coins, toys and pots. Whereas the general history 
	of Bharatvarsh is already written in its scriptures and the Puranas whose 
	texts and the philosophical descriptions are the outcome of the Gracious and 
	benevolent minds of eternal Saints. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also, arguing about the proven facts 
	of the Bhartiya history (which are re-authenticated by our great Masters) by 
	a worldly person (even if he is a higher degree holder) who is attached to 
	his intellectual, emotional and sensual enjoyments of a pure worldly nature, 
	is like a school going science student, who has read some science fiction 
	stories, happens to visit NASA Research Institute and sneaks into the 
	research chamber and starts telling the scientists how they are. But, this 
	is the age of the freedom of speech, anyone could say anything; still the 
	fact remains the fact and the fiction remains the fiction. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q5. But, Swamiji, some people 
	dismiss such attitudes as anti-intellectualistic ... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Some people have a critical 
	nature and a leaning towards non-Godliness which is the sign of the 
	impiousness of their heart and the biased structure of their mind. It is the 
	nature of such people that they cannot tolerate to read or hear about the 
	authentic and eternal Divineness of Bhartiya religion and Bhartiya history 
	which is described in the Puranas especially in the Bhagwatam. It is thus 
	wise to leave them to live with their own beliefs and don't try to 
	unnecessarily argue with them to accept the right thing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q6: Swamiji, you write in your book: 
	&quot;We find that the ancient society of Greece had adopted certain social 
	customs that were prevailing in India. Such as: the husband headed the 
	family and the wife ran the household affairs; parents arranged and decided 
	their children’s marriage; a girl was controlled and protected by her 
	parents before marriage and by her husband after marriage; and many more 
	such customs.&quot; The California textbooks say the same -- that &quot;men had many 
	more rights than women&quot; – but the Hindu Education Foundation has called this 
	a distortion of truth and the Hindu American Foundation has threatened to 
	sue the California State Board over this (and other things). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: I don’t take much interest in 
	such worldly matters, puthra (son). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q7: In two years, Texas school 
	textbooks (dealing with Indian history) will be up for review. &quot;Anything is 
	possible in Bush-land&quot; your devotees say, and a friend has claimed that the 
	&quot;Hindu American community of Texas has already started gearing up for quite 
	some time now, and has been historically very well organized for over a 
	decade.&quot; What are your thoughts on this fight closer home? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Puthra, the whole brahmand 
	(universe) is the creation of our Lord. Such geographical differences don't 
	matter to us Swamis; California or Texas or New Delhi, it's all the same for 
	us. And if we don’t succeed the first time, we won't quit. As Swami 
	Vivekanand said: &quot;Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q8: Swamiji, could you comment on 
	the Divinity of our scriptures? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Bhartiya scriptures are the 
	Divine powers eternally residing in the Divine abode of God. With the will 
	of God they are introduced in the world through Brahma who transfers this 
	knowledge to the Rishis (Sages). Later on those Rishis reproduce them in the 
	form of scriptures; their very first manifestation was trillions of years 
	ago when our Brahmand (universe) along with the planetary system was 
	originally created by Brahma. Our scriptures also reveal the various 
	sciences (Sanskrit grammar and language, astrology, sociology, defense and 
	medicine etc.) for the good of the people of the world in general. It is an 
	axiom that everything that is produced by God is eternal, because God is 
	eternal. Thus, the knowledge of God and the knowledge of the path to God are 
	both eternal, and the scriptures containing those knowledges along with the 
	Sanskrit language are also eternal. And the Vedas and the Upnishads 
	themselves reveal their own eternity along with the other scriptures as well 
	as the Sanskrit grammar also. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q9: Papal infallibility adds an aura 
	to the Catholic Church. Are Bhartiya scriptures infallible too? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Bhartiya must know that our 
	scriptures were produced by God Himself Who is the creator of the entire 
	universe, and they were introduced in the world by Brahma who is the creator 
	of this very brahmand. Thus, they are the absolute truth and there could 
	never be a mistake in their philosophy. Whatever theoretical discrepancies 
	are found between Bhartiya scriptures and the modern science, they are only 
	in the theories of the worldly scientists because they are the products of 
	material minds. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q10: What can (potential) 
	participants in the 4-week study course (based on your book) offered by the 
	Vedic Foundation learn about Bhartiya scriptures? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: In the Bhartiya scriptures, 
	sincere intellectuals find all the answers of their intellectual quest; 
	pious scientists find the consolence of their heart and a guideline for 
	their future research; truthful scholars find the philosophy of their liking 
	that opens the path to God; and the selfless devotees of God find such a 
	sure and simple path of devotion and adoration to their beloved God that 
	fills their heart and mind with the sweetness of the devotional love. An 
	impious mind does not accept the Divine truth. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q11: Thanks, Swamiji, for your 
	concise definitions of sincerity, piety, truthfulness and selflessness. But 
	why have the scientists ignored the wealth of knowledge in our scriptures, 
	and instead propounded such fantastic theories as the Big Bang? Are they all 
	impious? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Hindu scriptures reveal the 
	scientific axioms that are extremely helpful in the research and the 
	development of science. But, the intelligentsia of the world as well as the 
	researchers of the physical sciences, being skeptical of Hindu religion, 
	never thought of using the scientific knowledge of the Upnishads and the 
	Puranas to promote their study and researches in the right direction. Had 
	they trusted the Divine greatness of our scriptures, the scientific 
	achievements of the world would have been much more positive, productive and 
	directed towards the right direction. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q12: Do our scriptures discuss the 
	science of creation? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Of course, they do! Our 
	scriptures describe the origin, evolution and the creation of this universe 
	which is apparently the manifestation of an endless, eternal and lifeless 
	energy that works with the help of God and involves unlimited number of 
	infinitesimal souls which remain under its bondage. They are the 
	manifestations of the same Divine power which has created this universe and 
	so they bear the true principles of the creation and the evolution science. 
	According to the Bhagwatam, which represents the total knowledge of all the 
	Bhartiya scriptures, our planetary system (along with all the celestial 
	abodes) was originally created by Brahma 155.5219719616 trillion years ago.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q13: Thanks, Swamiji. Such accurate 
	estimates of the age of the universe are indeed a tribute to Vedic astronomy 
	and mathematics. However, when Christian theories of creation have failed in 
	the west, how can we hope for acceptance of the Bhartiya theory of creation?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: One thing we must know is that 
	most of the scientists, archaeologists and geologists, who directly deal 
	with the natural phenomena all the time in their life, do not believe in 
	God; because the dogmatic God of the Bible does not appeal to their 
	intellect and they are mostly unaware of the universal Graciousness of the 
	Hindu religion. So, they don’t want to bring God into their theory. However, 
	I share Dr. Deendayal Khandelwal’s hope that &quot;the facts brought to light in 
	this book about creation and languages will lead to new research in the 
	fields of anthropology and astronomy and will lead (both Indians and 
	non-Indians) to search for new directions for research in the fields of 
	physical sciences based on the Hindu scriptural statements.&quot; I also hope 
	that more people will echo the thoughts of Dr. Mahesh Mehta, founder of the 
	Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America: &quot;The time has come that the scientific 
	knowledges of the Upnishads in relation to the Creation should be considered 
	as a guideline for further researches in cosmology.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q14: Your thoughts on Sanskrit ...
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Sanskrit is the language of the 
	Divine abodes, which are inhabited with unlimited Saints who are always 
	drowned in the felicity of the Bliss of their beloved God. Being the Divine 
	language it is perfect by its own nature. The perfection of the 
	pronunciation and the uniqueness of the grammar that stays the same in all 
	the ages (from the very beginning of human civilization and up till today) 
	are such features which themselves prove that Sanskrit is not man-made; it 
	is a divine gift to the people of this world. Sanskrit language has never 
	had any dialect, and in every age and in every corner of this brahmand (and 
	the earth planet) it always remains the same. To understand the Divine 
	greatness of the Sanskrit language, you have to know the origination and the 
	shortcomings of the western languages. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q15: For the uninitiated, could you 
	describe the salient features of our religion? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: The religion of Bharatvarsh is 
	the direct descension of the Grace of God which is manifested in the form of 
	our Divine scriptures. They reveal the total philosophy of each and every 
	aspect of God and the creation of this universe, and, at the same time, they 
	also reveal the process of God realization with all the necessary 
	informations, whatever a devotee may need during his devotional period ... 
	The history and the religion of Bharatvarsh are not like the history and the 
	religion of the western world which contains the accounts and the ideologies 
	of the material beings; this is the description of the Divine personalities, 
	Divine acts of our Sages and Saints, Divine descensions, and the knowledge 
	of the Divine approach to God that enables a soul to receive God 
	realization. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q16: Thanks, Swamiji, that was very 
	enlightening! But why doesn't the West appreciate the Divine Divinity of our 
	Divine culture? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: This is the age of materialism 
	called kaliyug that started 5,101 years ago (3102 BC). The effects of 
	kaliyug are to despise the Divine truth and to elevate the anti-God elements 
	in the name of God. In the last 200 years such despisations were much 
	greater when the English regime tried to destroy the culture and the 
	religion of India by all means, and, during that time, they deliberately 
	produced such derogatory literatures in huge quantities that confused and 
	misguided the whole world. Trying to impose the worldliness of their own 
	culture upon the Hindu faith, they introduced such fictitious theories and 
	disparaging dogmas that produced a derogatory and demeaning view of 
	Hinduism. These publications affected the minds of Hindu writers to such an 
	extent that they also began to think and write on the same lines. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">--- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q17: Swamiji, you say: &quot;Through its 
	unbroken [1,900 million-years-old Ganges valley] civilization, India 
	provides an unbroken Divine facility to obtain the Divine knowledge and to 
	proceed on the path to God realization to the souls of the whole world.&quot; How 
	do we account for our current subordinate status? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Our Divine teachings were 
	restricted from reaching the souls of the world by extensively promulgating 
	the adverse propagations about Bhartiya (Hindu) religion and culture by the 
	Britishers of that time, and in this way the whole world remained bereft of 
	the true knowledge of God realization. Thus, they deceived and misguided the 
	whole world by such acts that damaged the spiritual growth of millions of 
	people of the world. Its effects have gone so deep in the Hindu society that 
	many of the followers of Hinduism are not bereft of its damaging effects and 
	it shows up in their writings. All this has ruined the image of the Divine 
	greatness of Bhartiya religion and history. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Notes: 1) The California struggle's 
	significance for the Sangh Parivar is best illustrated by the Organiser's 
	(the RSS's English mouthpiece) keen interest in this issue, the active 
	participation of numerous Hindutva ideologues from India, and this premature 
	proclamation of victory by an activist during a global RSS meeting held in 
	Ahmedabad in December 2005: &quot;Through the Hindu Education Foundation run by 
	the RSS in California, we have succeeded in correcting the misleading 
	information in text books for primary and secondary classes.&quot; [The Times of 
	India, Ahmedabad Edition, Dec 31, 2005] The political significance of this 
	struggle was not lost on the other side as well, as numerous activist 
	(including Dalit) groups and academics who had fought against the RSS's 
	saffronization project in India also wrote to the Board [http://tinyurl.com/ojhhr]

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3) Ruder Finn’s President James 
	Harff once said, &quot;We are not paid to be moral.&quot; That he really meant what he 
	said is evident from Ruder Finn's activities in the past few years and their 
	current support of Hindutva. For more on Ruder Finn, see PRWatch.org&nbsp; [<a href="http://tinyurl.com/p4hqw">http://tinyurl.com/p4hqw</a>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4) Not surprisingly, the book has 
	won laurels from senior Hindutva ideologues like Tarun Vijay [Editor of the 
	RSS's Hindi weekly, Panchjanya], Vishnu Hari Dalmia (President of the Vishwa 
	Hindu Parishad) and Mahesh Mehta (founder of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of 
	America). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5) The invention of a distant Golden 
	Age is one of the cornerstones of the Hindutva ideology. As Christopher 
	Jaffrelot explains, upper caste Hindus sought to maintain the basic elements 
	of the (hierarchical) traditional social order by simultaneously 
	stigmatizing and emulating those who allegedly threatened Hindu society. 
	&quot;The tension between cultural preservation and modernization was solved 
	through the invention of a distant Golden Age which was both indigenous and 
	in accord with modern values.&quot; Prakashanand Saraswati's fulfils both 
	objectives -- it invents a Golden past whose accomplishments not only 
	measure up well against the present, but were better in all respects! </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6) White America is often uncritical 
	of its own practices while sneering at others' irrationality, but that 
	doesn't make the latter any more respectable. Institutional racism cannot be 
	fought by glorifying irrational practices and beliefs as minority rights, as 
	the Hindutva forces unsuccessfully attempted in California. Hindutva's 
	cynical invocation of minority rights in California, even as their Indian 
	buddies are celebrating one of their Nazi-loving leaders, is just one more 
	example of their doublespeak. [Golwalkar, the second dictator of the RSS, 
	endorsed the Nazi Holocaust and called it &quot;a good lesson for us in 
	Hindusthan to learn and profit by.&quot; For more on Golwalkar, see
	<a href="http://www.imc-usa.org/digest/special/2006/golwalkar.fascism.htm">

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7) As Saraswati claims (and the RSS 
	would gladly agree): &quot;'Bhartiya' and 'Hindu' terms are synonymous. But when 
	an emphasis is needed to represent the spirituality of India we normally use 
	the terms Bhartiya and Bharatvarsh. Bharatvarsh (and its short term Bharat) 
	is the original Sanskrit term for India; and, that which is related to 
	Bharatvarsh is called Bhartiya.&quot; </font></p>

	&quot;resources on Hinduism&quot; page points to this website that seeks to historify 
	the mythical Pushpak Vimana &quot;which could fly at the speed of thought&quot;! [<a href="http://www.atributetohinduism.com/Vimanas.htm">http://www.atributetohinduism.com/Vimanas.htm</a>
