		<font face="Verdana">Voice of Bengal</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1913/index.html">
		Rabindranath Tagore</a>, who died in 1941 at the age of eighty, is a 
		towering figure in the millennium-old literature of Bengal. Anyone who 
		becomes familiar with this large and flourishing tradition will be 
		impressed by the power of Tagore's presence in Bangladesh and in India. 
		His poetry as well as his novels, short stories, and essays are very 
		widely read, and the songs he composed reverberate around the eastern 
		part of India and throughout Bangladesh.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In contrast, 
		in the rest of the world, especially in Europe and America, the 
		excitement that Tagore's writings created in the early years of the 
		twentieth century has largely vanished. The enthusiasm with which his 
		work was once greeted was quite remarkable. <i>Gitanjali,</i> a 
		selection of his poetry for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 
		Literature in 1913, was published in English translation in London in 
		March of that year, and had been reprinted ten times by November, when 
		the award was announced. But he is not much read now in the West, and 
		already by 1937, Graham Greene was able to say: &quot;As for Rabindranath 
		Tagore, I cannot believe that anyone but
		<a href="http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1923/index.html">Mr. 
		Yeats</a> can still take his poems very seriously.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="b" name="b"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">The Mystic</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The contrast 
		between Tagore's commanding presence in Bengali literature and culture, 
		and his near-total eclipse in the rest of the world, is perhaps less 
		interesting than the distinction between the view of Tagore as a deeply 
		relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker in Bangladesh and India, 
		and his image in the West as a repetitive and remote spiritualist. 
		Graham Greene had, in fact, gone on to explain that he associated Tagore 
		&quot;with what Chesterton calls 'the bright pebbly eyes' of the 
		Theosophists.&quot; Certainly, an air of mysticism played some part in the 
		&quot;selling&quot; of Rabindranath Tagore to the West by Yeats, Ezra Pound, and 
		his other early champions. Even Anna Akhmatova, one of Tagore's few 
		later admirers (who translated his poems into Russian in the mid-1960s), 
		talks of &quot;that mighty flow of poetry which takes its strength from 
		Hinduism as from the Ganges, and is called Rabindranath Tagore.&quot;</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">Confluence of Cultures</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		did come from a Hindu family—one of the landed gentry who owned estates 
		mostly in what is now Bangladesh. But whatever wisdom there might be in 
		Akhmatova's invoking of Hinduism and the Ganges, it did not prevent the 
		largely Muslim citizens of Bangladesh from having a deep sense of 
		identity with Tagore and his ideas. Nor did it stop the newly 
		independent Bangladesh from choosing one of Tagore's songs—the &quot;Amar 
		Sonar Bangla&quot; which means &quot;my golden Bengal&quot;—as its national anthem. 
		This must be very confusing to those who see the contemporary world as a 
		&quot;clash of civilizations&quot;—with &quot;the Muslim civilization,&quot; &quot;the Hindu 
		civilization,&quot; and &quot;the Western civilization,&quot; each forcefully 
		confronting the others. They would also be confused by Rabindranath 
		Tagore's own description of his Bengali family as the product of &quot;a 
		confluence of three cultures: Hindu, Mohammedan, and British&quot;.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Rabindranath's grandfather, Dwarkanath, was well known for his command 
		of Arabic and Persian, and Rabindranath grew up in a family atmosphere 
		in which a deep knowledge of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu texts was 
		combined with an understanding of Islamic traditions as well as Persian 
		literature. It is not so much that Rabindranath tried to produce—or had 
		an interest in producing—a &quot;synthesis&quot; of the different religions (as 
		the great Moghul emperor Akbar tried hard to achieve) as that his 
		outlook was persistently non-sectarian, and his writings—some two 
		hundred books—show the influence of different parts of the Indian 
		cultural background as well as of the rest of the world. <sup>
		<a href="#2">2</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="d" name="d"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">Abode of Peace</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most of his 
		work was written at Santiniketan (Abode of Peace), the small town that 
		grew around the school he founded in Bengal in 1901, and he not only 
		conceived there an imaginative and innovative system of education, but 
		through his writings and his influence on students and teachers, he was 
		able to use the school as a base from which he could take a major part 
		in India's social, political, and cultural movements.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
		profoundly original writer, whose elegant prose and magical poetry 
		Bengali readers know well, is not the sermonizing spiritual guru 
		admired—and then rejected—in London. Tagore was not only an immensely 
		versatile poet; he was also a great short story writer, novelist, 
		playwright, essayist, and composer of songs, as well as a talented 
		painter whose pictures, with their mixture of representation and 
		abstraction, are only now beginning to receive the acclaim that they 
		have long deserved. His essays, moreover, ranged over literature, 
		politics, culture, social change, religious beliefs, philosophical 
		analysis, international relations, and much else. The coincidence of the 
		fiftieth anniversary of Indian independence with the publication of a 
		selection of Tagore's letters by Cambridge University Press <sup>
		<a href="#3">3</a></sup>, brought Tagore's ideas and reflections to the 
		fore, which makes it important to examine what kind of leadership in 
		thought and understanding he provided in the Indian subcontinent in the 
		first half of this century.</font></p>

		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="e" name="e"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">Gandhi and Tagore</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since 
		Rabindranath Tagore and Mohandas Gandhi were two leading Indian thinkers 
		in the twentieth century, many commentators have tried to compare their 
		ideas. On learning of Rabindranath's death, Jawaharlal Nehru, then 
		incarcerated in a British jail in India, wrote in his prison diary for 
		August 7, 1941:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">&quot;Gandhi 
			and Tagore. Two types entirely different from each other, and yet 
			both of them typical of India, both in the long line of India's 
			great men ... It is not so much because of any single virtue but 
			because of the <i>tout ensemble,</i> that I felt that among the 
			world's great men today Gandhi and Tagore were supreme as human 
			beings. What good fortune for me to have come into close contact 
			with them.&quot;</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1915/index.html">
		Romain Rolland</a> was fascinated by the contrast between them, and when 
		he completed his book on Gandhi, he wrote to an Indian academic, in 
		March 1923: &quot;I have finished my <i>Gandhi,</i> in which I pay tribute to 
		your two great river-like souls, overflowing with divine spirit, Tagore 
		and Gandhi.&quot; The following month, he recorded in his diary an account of 
		some of the differences between Gandhi and Tagore written by Reverend 
		C.F. Andrews, the English clergyman and public activist who was a close 
		friend of both men (and whose important role in Gandhi's life in South 
		Africa as well as India is well portrayed in Richard Attenborough's film 
		Gandhi [1982]). Andrews described to Rolland a discussion between Tagore 
		and Gandhi, at which he was present, on subjects that divided them:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">&quot;The 
			first subject of discussion was idols; Gandhi defended them, 
			believing the masses incapable of raising themselves immediately to 
			abstract ideas. Tagore cannot bear to see the people eternally 
			treated as a child. Gandhi quoted the great things achieved in 
			Europe by the flag as an idol; Tagore found it easy to object, but 
			Gandhi held his ground, contrasting European flags bearing eagles, 
			etc., with his own, on which he has put a spinning wheel. The second 
			point of discussion was nationalism, which Gandhi defended. He said 
			that one must go through nationalism to reach internationalism, in 
			the same way that one must go through war to reach peace.&quot;<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore 
		greatly admired Gandhi but he had many disagreements with him on a 
		variety of subjects, including nationalism, patriotism, the importance 
		of cultural exchange, the role of rationality and of science, and the 
		nature of economic and social development. These differences, I shall 
		argue, have a clear and consistent pattern, with Tagore pressing for 
		more room for reasoning, and for a less traditionalist view, a greater 
		interest in the rest of the world, and more respect for science and for 
		objectivity generally.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		knew that he could not have given India the political leadership that 
		Gandhi provided, and he was never stingy in his praise for what Gandhi 
		did for the nation (it was, in fact, Tagore who popularized the term 
		&quot;Mahatma&quot;—great soul—as a description of Gandhi). And yet each remained 
		deeply critical of many things that the other stood for. That Mahatma 
		Gandhi has received incomparably more attention outside India and also 
		within much of India itself makes it important to understand &quot;Tagore's 
		side&quot; of the Gandhi-Tagore debates.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his prison 
		diary, Nehru wrote: &quot;Perhaps it is as well that [Tagore] died now and 
		did not see the many horrors that are likely to descend in increasing 
		measure on the world and on India. He had seen enough and he was 
		infinitely sad and unhappy.&quot; Toward the end of his life, Tagore was 
		indeed becoming discouraged about the state of India, especially as its 
		normal burden of problems, such as hunger and poverty, was being 
		supplemented by politically organized incitement to &quot;communal&quot; violence 
		between Hindus and Muslims. This conflict would lead in 1947, six years 
		after Tagore's death, to the widespread killing that took place during 
		partition; but there was much gore already during his declining days. In 
		December 1939, he wrote to his friend Leonard Elmhirst, the English 
		philanthropist and social reformer who had worked closely with him on 
		rural reconstruction in India (and who had gone on to found the 
		Dartington Hall Trust in England and a progressive school at Dartington 
		that explicitly invoked Rabindranath's educational ideals):<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup></font></p>
		<blockquote class="quote">
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It does not need a 
			defeatist to feel deeply anxious about the future of millions who, 
			with all their innate culture and their peaceful traditions are 
			being simultaneously subjected to hunger, disease, exploitations 
			foreign and indigenous, and the seething discontents of 
			communalism.&quot; </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How would 
		Tagore have viewed the India of today? Would he see progress there, or 
		wasted opportunity, perhaps even a betrayal of its promise and 
		conviction? And, on a wider subject, how would he react to the spread of 
		cultural separatism in the contemporary world?</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="f" name="f"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">East and West</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the 
		vast range of his creative achievements, perhaps the most astonishing 
		aspect of the image of Tagore in the West is its narrowness; he is 
		recurrently viewed as &quot;the great mystic from the East,&quot; an image with a 
		putative message for the West, which some would welcome, others dislike, 
		and still others find deeply boring. To a great extent this Tagore was 
		the West's own creation, part of its tradition of message-seeking from 
		the East, particularly from India, which—as Hegel put it—had &quot;existed 
		for millennia in the imagination of the Europeans.&quot;<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> 
		Friedrich Schlegel, Schelling, Herder, and Schopenhauer were only a few 
		of the thinkers who followed the same pattern. They theorized, at first, 
		that India was the source of superior wisdom. Schopenhauer at one stage 
		even argued that the New Testament &quot;must somehow be of Indian origin: 
		this is attested by its completely Indian ethics, which transforms 
		morals into asceticism, its pessimism, and its avatar,&quot; in &quot;the person 
		of Christ.&quot; But then they rejected their own theories with great 
		vehemence, sometimes blaming India for not living up to their unfounded 
		expectations.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We can 
		imagine that Rabindranath's physical appearance—handsome, bearded, 
		dressed in non-Western clothes—may, to some extent, have encouraged his 
		being seen as a carrier of exotic wisdom.
		<a href="http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1968/index.html">
		Yasunari Kawabata</a>, the first Japanese Nobel Laureate in Literature, 
		treasured memories from his middle-school days of &quot;this sage-like poet&quot;:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">His 
			white hair flowed softly down both sides of his forehead; the tufts 
			of hair under the temples also were long like two beards, and 
			linking up with the hair on his cheeks, continued into his beard, so 
			that he gave an impression, to the boy I was then, of some ancient 
			Oriental wizard.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup></span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That 
		appearance would have been well-suited to the selling of Tagore in the 
		West as a quintessentially mystical poet, and it could have made it 
		somewhat easier to pigeonhole him. Commenting on Rabindranath's 
		appearance, Frances Cornford told William Rothenstein, &quot;I can now 
		imagine a powerful and gentle Christ, which I never could before.&quot; 
		Beatrice Webb, who did not like Tagore and resented what she took to be 
		his &quot;quite obvious dislike of all that the Webbs stand for&quot; (there is, 
		in fact, little evidence that Tagore had given much thought to this 
		subject), said that he was &quot;beautiful to look at&quot; and that &quot;his speech 
		has the perfect intonation and slow chant-like moderation of the 
		dramatic saint.&quot; Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats, among others, first led the 
		chorus of adoration in the Western appreciation of Tagore, and then soon 
		moved to neglect and even shrill criticism. The contrast between Yeats's 
		praise of his work in 1912 (&quot;These lyrics…display in their thought a 
		world I have dreamed of all my life long,&quot; &quot;the work of a supreme 
		culture&quot;) and his denunciation in 1935 (&quot;Damn Tagore&quot;) arose partly from 
		the inability of Tagore's many-sided writings to fit into the narrow box 
		in which Yeats wanted to place—and keep—him. Certainly, Tagore did write 
		a huge amount, and published ceaselessly, even in English (sometimes in 
		indifferent English translation), but Yeats was also bothered, it is 
		clear, by the difficulty of fitting Tagore's later writings into the 
		image Yeats had presented to the West. Tagore, he had said, was the 
		product of &quot;a whole people, a whole civilization, immeasurably strange 
		to us,&quot; and yet &quot;we have met our own image,…or heard, perhaps for the 
		first time in literature, our voice as in a dream.&quot;<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yeats did not 
		totally reject his early admiration (as Ezra Pound and several others 
		did), and he included some of Tagore's early poems in <i>The Oxford Book 
		of Modern Verse,</i> which he edited in 1936. Yeats also had some 
		favorable things to say about Tagore's prose writings. His censure of 
		Tagore's later poems was reinforced by his dislike of Tagore's own 
		English translations of his work (&quot;Tagore does not know English, no 
		Indian knows English,&quot; Yeats explained), unlike the English version of
		<i>Gitanjali</i> which Yeats had himself helped to prepare. Poetry is, 
		of course, notoriously difficult to translate, and anyone who knows 
		Tagore's poems in their original Bengali cannot feel satisfied with any 
		of the translations (made with or without Yeats's help). Even the 
		translations of his prose works suffer, to some extent, from distortion. 
		E.M. Forster noted, in a review of a translation of one of Tagore's 
		great Bengali novels, <i>The Home and the World,</i> in 1919: &quot;The theme 
		is so beautiful,&quot; but the charms have &quot;vanished in translation,&quot; or 
		perhaps &quot;in an experiment that has not quite come off.&quot;<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore 
		himself played a somewhat bemused part in the boom and bust of his 
		English reputation. He accepted the extravagant praise with much 
		surprise as well as pleasure, and then received denunciations with even 
		greater surprise, and barely concealed pain. Tagore was sensitive to 
		criticism, and was hurt by even the most far-fetched accusations, such 
		as the charge that he was getting credit for the work of Yeats, who had 
		&quot;rewritten&quot; Gitanjali. (This charge was made by a correspondent for The 
		Times, Sir Valentine Chirol, whom E.M. Forster once described as &quot;an old 
		Anglo-Indian reactionary hack.&quot;) From time to time Tagore also protested 
		the crudity of some of his overexcited advocates. He wrote to C.F. 
		Andrews in 1920: &quot;These people…are like drunkards who are afraid of 
		their lucid intervals.&quot;</font></p>

		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">God and Others</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yeats was not 
		wrong to see a large religious element in Tagore's writings. He 
		certainly had interesting and arresting things to say about life and 
		death. Susan Owen, the mother of Wilfred Owen, wrote to Rabindranath in 
		1920, describing her last conversations with her son before he left for 
		the war which would take his life. Wilfred said goodbye with &quot;those 
		wonderful words of yours—beginning at 'When I go from hence, let this be 
		my parting word.'&quot; When Wilfred's pocket notebook was returned to his 
		mother, she found &quot;these words written in his dear writing—with your 
		name beneath.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The idea of a 
		direct, joyful, and totally fearless relationship with God can be found 
		in many of Tagore's religious writings, including the poems of <i>
		Gitanjali.</i> From India's diverse religious traditions he drew many 
		ideas, both from ancient texts and from popular poetry. But &quot;the bright 
		pebbly eyes of the Theosophists&quot; do not stare out of his verses. Despite 
		the archaic language of the original translation of <i>Gitanjali,</i> 
		which did not, I believe, help to preserve the simplicity of the 
		original, its elementary humanity comes through more clearly than any 
		complex and intense spirituality:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Leave 
			this chanting and singing and telling of beads! Whom dost thou 
			worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?<br>
			Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!<br>
			He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where 
			the pathmaker is breaking stones.<br>
			He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered 
			with dust.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An ambiguity 
		about religious experience is central to many of Tagore's devotional 
		poems, and makes them appeal to readers irrespective of their beliefs; 
		but excessively detailed interpretation can ruinously strip away that 
		ambiguity.<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup> This applies particularly to 
		his many poems which combine images of human love and those of pious 
		devotion. Tagore writes:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">I have 
			no sleep to-night. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the 
			darkness, my friend!<br>
			I can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path!<br>
			By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the 
			frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom, art thou 
			threading thy course to come to see me, my friend?</span> </font>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I suppose it 
		could be helpful to be told, as Yeats hastens to explain, that &quot;the 
		servant or the bride awaiting the master's home-coming in the empty 
		house&quot; is &quot;among the images of the heart turning to God.&quot; But in Yeats's 
		considerate attempt to make sure that the reader does not miss the &quot;main 
		point,&quot; something of the enigmatic beauty of the Bengali poem is lost - 
		even what had survived the antiquated language of the English 
		translation. Tagore certainly had strongly held religious beliefs (of an 
		unusually nondenominational kind), but he was interested in a great many 
		other things as well and had many different things to say about them.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some of the 
		ideas he tried to present were directly political, and they figure 
		rather prominently in his letters and lectures. He had practical, 
		plainly expressed views about nationalism, war and peace, cross-cultural 
		education, freedom of the mind, the importance of rational criticism, 
		the need for openness, and so on. His admirers in the West, however, 
		were tuned to the more otherworldly themes which had been emphasized by 
		his first Western patrons. People came to his public lectures in Europe 
		and America, expecting ruminations on grand, transcendental themes; when 
		they heard instead his views on the way public leaders should behave, 
		there was some resentment, particularly (as E.P. Thompson reports) when 
		he delivered political criticism &quot;at $700 a scold.&quot;</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">Reasoning in Freedom</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For Tagore it 
		was of the highest importance that people be able to live, and reason, 
		in freedom. His attitudes toward politics and culture, nationalism and 
		internationalism, tradition and modernity, can all be seen in the light 
		of this belief.<sup><a href="#11">11</a></sup> Nothing, perhaps, 
		expresses his values as clearly as a poem in <i>Gitanjali:</i></font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Where 
			the mind is without fear<br>
			and the head is held high;<br>
			Where knowledge is free;<br>
			Where the world has not been<br>
			broken up into fragments<br>
			by narrow domestic walls; ...<br>
			Where the clear stream of reason<br>
			has not lost its way into the<br>
			dreary desert sand of dead habit; ...<br>
			Into that heaven of freedom,<br>
			my Father, let my country awake.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Rabindranath's qualified support for nationalist movements—and his 
		opposition to the unfreedom of alien rule—came from this commitment. So 
		did his reservations about patriotism, which, he argued, can limit both 
		the freedom to engage ideas from outside &quot;narrow domestic walls&quot; and the 
		freedom also to support the causes of people in other countries. 
		Rabindranath's passion for freedom underlies his firm opposition to 
		unreasoned traditionalism, which makes one a prisoner of the past (lost, 
		as he put it, in &quot;the dreary desert sand of dead habit&quot;).</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore 
		illustrates the tyranny of the past in his amusing yet deeply serious 
		parable &quot;Kartar Bhoot&quot; (&quot;The Ghost of the Leader&quot;). As the respected 
		leader of an imaginary land is about to die, his panic-stricken 
		followers request him to stay on after his death to instruct them on 
		what to do. He consents. But his followers find their lives are full of 
		rituals and constraints on everyday behavior and are not responsive to 
		the world around them. Ultimately, they request the ghost of the leader 
		to relieve them of his domination, when he informs them that he exists 
		only in their minds.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's deep 
		aversion to any commitment to the past that could not be modified by 
		contemporary reason extended even to the alleged virtue of invariably 
		keeping past promises. On one occasion when Mahatma Gandhi visited 
		Tagore's school at Santiniketan, a young woman got him to sign her 
		autograph book. Gandhi wrote: &quot;Never make a promise in haste. Having 
		once made it fulfill it at the cost of your life.&quot; When he saw this 
		entry, Tagore became agitated. He wrote in the same book a short poem in 
		Bengali to the effect that no one can be made &quot;a prisoner forever with a 
		chain of clay.&quot; He went on to conclude in English, possibly so that 
		Gandhi could read it too, &quot;Fling away your promise if it is found to be 
		wrong.&quot;<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup></font></p>

		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore had 
		the greatest admiration for Mahatma Gandhi as a person and as a 
		political leader, but he was also highly skeptical of Gandhi's form of 
		nationalism and his conservative instincts regarding the country's past 
		traditions. He never criticized Gandhi personally. In the 1938 essay, 
		&quot;Gandhi the Man,&quot; he wrote:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Great as 
			he is as a politician, as an organizer, as a leader of men, as a 
			moral reformer, he is greater than all these as a man, because none 
			of these aspects and activities limits his humanity. They are rather 
			inspired and sustained by it.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And yet there 
		is a deep division between the two men. Tagore was explicit about his 
		disagreement:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">We who 
			often glorify our tendency to ignore reason, installing in its place 
			blind faith, valuing it as spiritual, are ever paying for its cost 
			with the obscuration of our mind and destiny. I blamed Mahatmaji for 
			exploiting this irrational force of credulity in our people, which 
			might have had a quick result [in creating] a superstructure, while 
			sapping the foundation. Thus began my estimate of Mahatmaji, as the 
			guide of our nation, and it is fortunate for me that it did not end 
			there.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But while it 
		&quot;did not end there,&quot; that difference of vision was a powerful divider. 
		Tagore, for example, remained unconvinced of the merit of Gandhi's 
		forceful advocacy that everyone should spin at home with the &quot;charka,&quot; 
		the primitive spinning wheel. For Gandhi this practice was an important 
		part of India's self-realization. &quot;The spinning-wheel gradually became,&quot; 
		as his biographer B.R. Nanda writes, &quot;the center of rural uplift in the 
		Gandhian scheme of Indian economics.&quot;<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup> 
		Tagore found the alleged economic rationale for this scheme quite 
		unrealistic. As Romain Rolland noted, Rabindranath &quot;never tires of 
		criticizing the charka.&quot; In this economic judgment, Tagore was probably 
		right. Except for the rather small specialized market for high-quality 
		spun cloth, it is hard to make economic sense of hand-spinning, even 
		with wheels less primitive than Gandhi's charka. Hand-spinning as a 
		widespread activity can survive only with the help of heavy government 
		subsidies.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> However, Gandhi's advocacy of 
		the charka was not based only on economics. He wanted everyone to spin 
		for &quot;thirty minutes every day as a sacrifice,&quot; seeing this as a way for 
		people who are better off to identify themselves with the less 
		fortunate. He was impatient with Tagore's refusal to grasp this point:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">The poet 
			lives for the morrow, and would have us do likewise…. &quot;Why should I, 
			who have no need to work for food, spin?&quot; may be the question asked. 
			Because I am eating what does not belong to me. I am living on the 
			spoliation of my countrymen. Trace the source of every coin that 
			finds its way into your pocket, and you will realise the truth of 
			what I write. Every one must spin. Let Tagore spin like the others. 
			Let him burn his foreign clothes; that is the duty today. God will 
			take care of the morrow.<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup></span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If Tagore had 
		missed something in Gandhi's argument, so did Gandhi miss the point of 
		Tagore's main criticism. It was not only that the charka made little 
		economic sense, but also, Tagore thought, that it was not the way to 
		make people reflect on anything: &quot;The charka does not require anyone to 
		think; one simply turns the wheel of the antiquated invention endlessly, 
		using the minimum of judgment and stamina.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="i" name="i"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">Celibacy and Personal Life</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore and 
		Gandhi's attitudes toward personal life were also quite different. 
		Gandhi was keen on the virtues of celibacy, theorized about it, and, 
		after some years of conjugal life, made a private commitment—publicly 
		announced—to refrain from sleeping with his wife. Rabindranath's own 
		attitude on this subject was very different, but he was gentle about 
		their disagreements:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">
			[Gandhiji] condemns sexual life as inconsistent with the moral 
			progress of man, and has a horror of sex as great as that of the 
			author of <i>The Kreutzer Sonata,</i> but, unlike Tolstoy, he 
			betrays no abhorrence of the sex that tempts his kind. In fact, his 
			tenderness for women is one of the noblest and most consistent 
			traits of his character, and he counts among the women of his 
			country some of his best and truest comrades in the great movement 
			he is leading.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's 
		personal life was, in many ways, an unhappy one. He married in 1883, 
		lost his wife in 1902, and never remarried. He sought close 
		companionship, which he did not always get (perhaps even during his 
		married life—he wrote to his wife, Mrinalini: &quot;If you and I could be 
		comrades in all our work and in all our thoughts it would be splendid, 
		but we cannot attain all that we desire&quot;). He maintained a warm 
		friendship with, and a strong Platonic attachment to, the 
		literature-loving wife, Kadambari, of his elder brother, 
		Jyotirindranath. He dedicated some poems to her before his marriage, and 
		several books afterward, some after her death (she committed suicide, 
		for reasons that are not fully understood, at the age of twenty-five, 
		four months after Rabindranath's wedding). Much later in life, during 
		his tour of Argentina in 1924-1925, Rabindranath came to know the 
		talented and beautiful Victoria Ocampo, who later became the publisher 
		of the literary magazine <i>Sur.</i> They became close friends, but it 
		appears that Rabindranath deflected the possibility of a passionate 
		relationship into a confined intellectual one.<sup><a href="#16">16</a></sup> 
		His friend Leonard Elmhirst, who accompanied Rabindranath on his 
		Argentine tour, wrote:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Besides 
			having a keen intellectual understanding of his books, she was in 
			love with him—but instead of being content to build a friendship on 
			the basis of intellect, she was in a hurry to establish that kind of 
			proprietary right over him which he absolutely would not brook.</span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ocampo and 
		Elmhirst, while remaining friendly, were both quite rude in what they 
		wrote about each other. Ocampo's book on Tagore (of which a Bengali 
		translation was made from the Spanish by the distinguished poet and 
		critic Shankha Ghosh) is primarily concerned with Tagore's writings but 
		also discusses the pleasures and difficulties of their relationship, 
		giving quite a different account from Elmhirst's, and never suggesting 
		any sort of proprietary intentions.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Victoria 
		Ocampo, however, makes it clear that she very much wanted to get 
		physically closer to Rabindranath: &quot;Little by little he [Tagore] 
		partially tamed the young animal, by turns wild and docile, who did not 
		sleep, dog-like, on the floor outside his door, simply because it was 
		not done.&quot;<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> Rabindranath, too, was clearly 
		very much attracted to her. He called her &quot;Vijaya&quot; (the Sanskrit 
		equivalent of Victoria), dedicated a book of poems to her, Purabi—an 
		&quot;evening melody,&quot; and expressed great admiration for her mind (&quot;like a 
		star that was distant&quot;). In a letter to her he wrote, as if to explain 
		his own reticence:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">When we 
			were together, we mostly played with words and tried to laugh away 
			our best opportunities to see each other clearly ... Whenever there 
			is the least sign of the nest becoming a jealous rival of the sky 
			[,] my mind, like a migrant bird, tries to take ... flight to a 
			distant shore.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Five years 
		later, during Tagore's European tour in 1930, he sent her a cable: &quot;Will 
		you not come and see me.&quot; She did. But their relationship did not seem 
		to go much beyond conversation, and their somewhat ambiguous 
		correspondence continued over the years. Written in 1940, a year before 
		his death at eighty, one of the poems in Sesh Lekha (&quot;Last Writings&quot;), 
		seems to be about her: &quot;How I wish I could once again find my way to 
		that foreign land where waits for me the message of love!/… Her language 
		I knew not, but what her eyes said will forever remain eloquent in its 
		anguish.&quot;<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup> However indecisive, or 
		confused, or awkward Rabindranath may have been, he certainly did not 
		share Mahatma Gandhi's censorious views of sex. In fact, when it came to 
		social policy, he advocated contraception and family planning while 
		Gandhi preferred abstinence.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">Science and the People</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gandhi and 
		Tagore severely clashed over their totally different attitudes toward 
		science. In January 1934, Bihar was struck by a devastating earthquake, 
		which killed thousands of people. Gandhi, who was then deeply involved 
		in the fight against untouchability (the barbaric system inherited from 
		India's divisive past, in which &quot;lowly people&quot; were kept at a physical 
		distance), extracted a positive lesson from the tragic event. &quot;A man 
		like me,&quot; Gandhi argued, &quot;cannot but believe this earthquake is a divine 
		chastisement sent by God for our sins&quot; —in particular the sins of 
		untouchability. &quot;For me there is a vital connection between the Bihar 
		calamity and the untouchability campaign.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore, who 
		equally abhorred untouchability and had joined Gandhi in the movements 
		against it, protested against this interpretation of an event that had 
		caused suffering and death to so many innocent people, including 
		children and babies. He also hated the epistemology implicit in seeing 
		an earthquake as caused by ethical failure. &quot;It is,&quot; he wrote, &quot;all the 
		more unfortunate because this kind of unscientific view of [natural] 
		phenomena is too readily accepted by a large section of our countrymen.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The two 
		remained deeply divided over their attitudes toward science. However, 
		while Tagore believed that modern science was essential to the 
		understanding of physical phenomena, his views on epistemology were 
		interestingly heterodox. He did not take the simple &quot;realist&quot; position 
		often associated with modern science. The report of his conversation 
		with Einstein, published in The New York Times in 1930, shows how 
		insistent Tagore was on interpreting truth through observation and 
		reflective concepts. To assert that something is true or untrue in the 
		absence of anyone to observe or perceive its truth, or to form a 
		conception of what it is, appeared to Tagore to be deeply questionable. 
		When Einstein remarked, &quot;If there were no human beings any more, the 
		Apollo Belvedere no longer would be beautiful?&quot; Tagore simply replied, 
		&quot;No.&quot; Going further—and into much more interesting territory—Einstein 
		said, &quot;I agree with regard to this conception of beauty, but not with 
		regard to truth.&quot; Tagore's response was: &quot;Why not? Truth is realized 
		through men.&quot;<sup><a href="#19">19</a><br>

		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's 
		epistemology, which he never pursued systematically, would seem to be 
		searching for a line of reasoning that would later be elegantly 
		developed by Hilary Putnam, who has argued: &quot;Truth depends on conceptual 
		schemes and it is nonetheless 'real truth.'&quot;<sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> 
		Tagore himself said little to explain his convictions, but it is 
		important to take account of his heterodoxy, not only because his 
		speculations were invariably interesting, but also because they 
		illustrate how his support for any position, including his strong 
		interest in science, was accompanied by critical scrutiny.</font></p>

		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="k" name="k"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">Nationalism and Colonialism</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was 
		predictably hostile to communal sectarianism (such as a Hindu orthodoxy 
		that was antagonistic to Islamic, Christian, or Sikh perspectives). But 
		even nationalism seemed to him to be suspect. Isaiah Berlin summarizes 
		well Tagore's complex position on Indian nationalism:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Tagore 
			stood fast on the narrow causeway, and did not betray his vision of 
			the difficult truth. He condemned romantic overattachment to the 
			past, what he called the tying of India to the past &quot;like a 
			sacrificial goat tethered to a post,&quot; and he accused men who 
			displayed it - they seemed to him reactionary - of not knowing what 
			true political freedom was, pointing out that it is from English 
			thinkers and English books that the very notion of political liberty 
			was derived. But against cosmopolitanism he maintained that the 
			English stood on their own feet, and so must Indians. In 1917 he 
			once more denounced the danger of ‘leaving everything to the 
			unalterable will of the Master,' be he brahmin or Englishman.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup></span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The duality 
		Berlin points to is well reflected also in Tagore's attitude toward 
		cultural diversity. He wanted Indians to learn what is going on 
		elsewhere, how others lived, what they valued, and so on, while 
		remaining interested and involved in their own culture and heritage. 
		Indeed, in his educational writings the need for synthesis is strongly 
		stressed. It can also be found in his advice to Indian students abroad. 
		In 1907 he wrote to his son-in-law Nagendranath Gangulee, who had gone 
		to America to study agriculture:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">To get 
			on familiar terms with the local people is a part of your education. 
			To know only agriculture is not enough; you must know America too. 
			Of course if, in the process of knowing America, one begins to lose 
			one's identity and falls into the trap of becoming an Americanised 
			person contemptuous of everything Indian, it is preferable to stay 
			in a locked room.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was 
		strongly involved in protest against the Raj on a number of occasions, 
		most notably in the movement to resist the 1905 British proposal to 
		split in two the province of Bengal, a plan that was eventually 
		withdrawn following popular resistance. He was forthright in denouncing 
		the brutality of British rule in India, never more so than after the 
		Amritsar massacre of April 13, 1919, when 379 unarmed people at a 
		peaceful meeting were gunned down by the army, and two thousand more 
		were wounded. Between April 23 and 26, Rabindranath wrote five agitated 
		letters to C.F. Andrews, who himself was extremely disturbed, especially 
		after he was told by a British civil servant in India that thanks to 
		this show of strength, the &quot;moral prestige&quot; of the Raj had &quot;never been 
		higher.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A month after 
		the massacre, Tagore wrote to the Viceroy of India, asking to be 
		relieved of the knighthood he had accepted four years earlier:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">The 
			disproportionate severity of the punishments inflicted upon the 
			unfortunate people and the methods of carrying them out, we are 
			convinced, are without parallel in the history of civilized 
			governments, barring some conspicuous exceptions, recent and remote. 
			Considering that such treatment has been meted out to a population, 
			disarmed and resourceless, by a power which has the most terribly 
			efficient organisation for destruction of human lives, we must 
			strongly assert that it can claim no political expediency, far less 
			moral justification.... The universal agony of indignation roused in 
			the hearts of our people has been ignored by our rulers - possibly 
			congratulating themselves for imparting what they imagine as 
			salutary lessons…. I for my part want to stand, shorn of all special 
			distinctions, by the side of those of my countrymen who for their

		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Both Gandhi 
		and Nehru expressed their appreciation of the important part Tagore took 
		in the national struggle. It is fitting that after independence, India 
		chose a song of Tagore (&quot;Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka,&quot; which can be 
		roughly translated as &quot;the leader of people's minds&quot;) as its national 
		anthem. Since Bangladesh would later choose another song of Tagore 
		(&quot;Amar Sonar Bangla&quot;) as its national anthem, he may be the only one 
		ever to have authored the national anthems of two different countries.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's 
		criticism of the British administration of India was consistently strong 
		and grew more intense over the years. This point is often missed, since 
		he made a special effort to dissociate his criticism of the Raj from any 
		denigration of British—or Western—people and culture. Mahatma Gandhi's 
		well-known quip in reply to a question, asked in England, on what he 
		thought of Western civilization (&quot;It would be a good idea&quot;) could not 
		have come from Tagore's lips. He would understand the provocations to 
		which Gandhi was responding - involving cultural conceit as well as 
		imperial tyranny. D.H. Lawrence supplied a fine example of the former: 
		&quot;I become more and more surprised to see how far higher, in reality, our 
		European civilization stands than the East, Indian and Persian, ever 
		dreamed of…. This fraud of looking up to them—this wretched 
		worship-of-Tagore attitude is disgusting.&quot; But, unlike Gandhi, Tagore 
		could not, even in jest, be dismissive of Western civilization.</font></p>

		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even in his 
		powerful indictment of British rule in India in 1941, in a lecture which 
		he gave on his last birthday, and which was later published as a 
		pamphlet under the title <i>Crisis in Civilization,</i> he strains hard 
		to maintain the distinction between opposing Western imperialism and 
		rejecting Western civilization. While he saw India as having been 
		&quot;smothered under the dead weight of British administration&quot; (adding 
		&quot;another great and ancient civilization for whose recent tragic history 
		the British cannot disclaim responsibility is China&quot;), Tagore recalls 
		what India has gained from &quot;discussions centred upon Shakespeare's drama 
		and Byron's poetry and above all…the large-hearted liberalism of 
		nineteenth-century English politics.&quot; The tragedy, as Tagore saw it, 
		came from the fact that what &quot;was truly best in their own civilization, 
		the upholding of dignity of human relationships, has no place in the 
		British administration of this country.&quot; &quot;If in its place they have 
		established, baton in hand, a reign of 'law and order,' or in other 
		words a policeman's rule, such a mockery of civilization can claim no

		<font face="Verdana">Critique of Patriotism</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		rebelled against the strongly nationalist form that the independence 
		movement often took, and this made him refrain from taking a 
		particularly active part in contemporary politics. He wanted to assert 
		India's right to be independent without denying the importance of what 
		India could learn—freely and profitably—from abroad. He was afraid that 
		a rejection of the West in favor of an indigenous Indian tradition was 
		not only limiting in itself; it could easily turn into hostility to 
		other influences from abroad, including Christianity, which came to 
		parts of India by the fourth century; Judaism, which came through Jewish 
		immigration shortly after the fall of Jerusalem, as did Zoroastrianism 
		through Parsi immigration later on (mainly in the eighth century), and, 
		of course—and most importantly—Islam, which has had a very strong 
		presence in India since the tenth century.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's 
		criticism of patriotism is a persistent theme in his writings. As early 
		as 1908, he put his position succinctly in a letter replying to the 
		criticism of Abala Bose, the wife of a great Indian scientist, Jagadish 
		Chandra Bose: &quot;Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter; my 
		refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds, and 
		I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I 
		live.&quot; His novel <i>Ghare Baire</i> (The Home and the World) has much to 
		say about this theme. In the novel, Nikhil, who is keen on social 
		reform, including women's liberation, but cool toward nationalism, 
		gradually loses the esteem of his spirited wife, Bimala, because of his 
		failure to be enthusiastic about anti-British agitations, which she sees 
		as a lack of patriotic commitment. Bimala becomes fascinated with 
		Nikhil's nationalist friend Sandip, who speaks brilliantly and acts with 
		patriotic militancy, and she falls in love with him. Nikhil refuses to 
		change his views: &quot;I am willing to serve my country; but my worship I 
		reserve for Right which is far greater than my country. To worship my 
		country as a god is to bring a curse upon it.&quot;<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the story 
		unfolds, Sandip becomes angry with some of his countrymen for their 
		failure to join the struggle as readily as he thinks they should (&quot;Some 
		Mohamedan traders are still obdurate&quot;). He arranges to deal with the 
		recalcitrants by burning their meager trading stocks and physically 
		attacking them. Bimala has to acknowledge the connection between 
		Sandip's rousing nationalistic sentiments and his sectarian - and 
		ultimately violent-actions. The dramatic events that follow (Nikhil 
		attempts to help the victims, risking his life) include the end of 
		Bimala's political romance.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is a 
		difficult subject, and Satyajit Ray's beautiful film of <i>The Home and 
		the World</i> brilliantly brings out the novel's tensions, along with 
		the human affections and disaffections of the story. Not surprisingly, 
		the story has had many detractors, not just among dedicated nationalists 
		in India. Georg Lukács found Tagore's novel to be &quot;a petit bourgeois 
		yarn of the shoddiest kind,&quot; &quot;at the intellectual service of the British 
		police,&quot; and &quot;a contemptible caricature of Gandhi.&quot; It would, of course, 
		be absurd to think of Sandip as Gandhi, but the novel gives a &quot;strong 
		and gentle&quot; warning, as Bertolt Brecht noted in his diary, of the 
		corruptibility of nationalism, since it is not even-handed. Hatred of 
		one group can lead to hatred of others, no matter how far such feeling 
		may be from the minds of large-hearted nationalist leaders like Mahatma 
		Gandhi.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">Admiration and Criticism of Japan</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's 
		reaction to nationalism in Japan is particularly telling. As in the case 
		of India, he saw the need to build the self-confidence of a defeated and 
		humiliated people, of people left behind by developments elsewhere, as 
		was the case in Japan before its emergence during the nineteenth 
		century. At the beginning of one of his lectures in Japan in 1916 
		(&quot;Nationalism in Japan&quot;), he observed that &quot;the worst form of bondage is 
		the bondage of dejection, which keeps men hopelessly chained in loss of 
		faith in themselves.&quot; Tagore shared the admiration for Japan widespread 
		in Asia for demonstrating the ability of an Asian nation to rival the 
		West in industrial development and economic progress. He noted with 
		great satisfaction that Japan had &quot;in giant strides left centuries of 
		inaction behind, overtaking the present time in its foremost 
		achievement.&quot; For other nations outside the West, he said, Japan &quot;has 
		broken the spell under which we lay in torpor for ages, taking it to be 
		the normal condition of certain races living in certain geographical 
		limits.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But then 
		Tagore went on to criticize the rise of a strong nationalism in Japan, 
		and its emergence as an imperialist nation. Tagore's outspoken 
		criticisms did not please Japanese audiences and, as E.P. Thompson 
		wrote, &quot;the welcome given to him on his first arrival soon cooled.&quot;<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup> 
		Twenty-two years later, in 1937, during the Japanese war on China, 
		Tagore received a letter from Rash Behari Bose, an anti-British Indian 
		revolutionary then living in Japan, who sought Tagore's approval for his 
		efforts there on behalf of Indian independence, in which he had the 
		support of the Japanese government. Tagore replied:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Your 
			cable has caused me many restless hours, for it hurts me very much 
			to have to ignore your appeal. I wish you had asked for my 
			cooperation in a cause against which my spirit did not protest. I 
			know, in making this appeal, you counted on my great regard for the 
			Japanese for I, along with the rest of Asia, did once admire and 
			look up to Japan and did once fondly hope that in Japan Asia had at 
			last discovered its challenge to the West, that Japan's new strength 
			would be consecrated in safeguarding the culture of the East against 
			alien interests. But Japan has not taken long to betray that rising 
			hope and repudiate all that seemed significant in her wonderful, 
			and, to us symbolic, awakening, and has now become itself a worse 
			menace to the defenceless peoples of the East.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How to view 
		Japan's position in the Second World War was a divisive issue in India. 
		After the war, when Japanese political leaders were tried for war 
		crimes, the sole dissenting voice among the judges came from the Indian 
		judge, Radhabinod Pal, a distinguished jurist. Pal dissented on various 
		grounds, among them that no fair trial was possible in view of the 
		asymmetry of power between the victor and the defeated. Ambivalent 
		feelings in India toward the Japanese military aggression, given the 
		unacceptable nature of British imperialism, possibly had a part in 
		predisposing Pal to consider a perspective different from that of the 
		other judges.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More 
		tellingly, Subhas Chandra Bose (no relation of Rash Behari Bose), a 
		leading nationalist, made his way to Japan during the war via Italy and 
		Germany after escaping from a British prison; he helped the Japanese to 
		form units of Indian soldiers, who had earlier surrendered to the 
		advancing Japanese army, to fight on the Japanese side as the &quot;Indian 
		National Army.&quot; Rabindranath had formerly entertained great admiration 
		for Subhas Bose as a dedicated nonsectarian fighter for Indian 
		independence.<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> But their ways would have 
		parted when Bose's political activities took this turn, although Tagore 
		was dead by the time Bose reached Japan.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore saw 
		Japanese militarism as illustrating the way nationalism can mislead even 
		a nation of great achievement and promise. In 1938 Yone Noguchi, the 
		distinguished poet and friend of Tagore (as well as of Yeats and Pound), 
		wrote to Tagore, pleading with him to change his mind about Japan. 
		Rabindranath's reply, written on September 12, 1938, was altogether 
		uncompromising:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">It seems 
			to me that it is futile for either of us to try to convince the 
			other, since your faith in the infallible right of Japan to bully 
			other Asiatic nations into line with your Government's policy is not 
			shared by me…. Believe me, it is sorrow and shame, not anger, that 
			prompt me to write to you. I suffer intensely not only because the 
			reports of Chinese suffering batter against my heart, but because I 
			can no longer point out with pride the example of a great Japan.</span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He would have 
		been much happier with the postwar emergence of Japan as a peaceful 
		power. Then, too, since he was not free of egotism, he would also have 
		been pleased by the attention paid to his ideas by the novelist Yasunari 
		Kawabata and others.<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup></font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">International Concerns</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was 
		not invariably well-informed about international politics. He allowed 
		himself to be entertained by Mussolini in a short visit to Italy in 
		May-June 1926, a visit arranged by Carlo Formichi, professor of Sanskrit 
		at the University of Rome. When he asked to meet Benedetto Croce, 
		Formichi said, &quot;Impossible! Impossible!&quot; Mussolini told him that Croce 
		was &quot;not in Rome.&quot; When Tagore said he would go &quot;wherever he is,&quot; 
		Mussolini assured him that Croce's whereabouts were unknown.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such 
		incidents, as well as warnings from Romain Rolland and other friends, 
		should have ended Tagore's flirtation with Mussolini more quickly than 
		it did. But only after he received graphic accounts of the brutality of 
		Italian fascism from two exiles, Gaetano Salvemini and Gaetano 
		Salvadori, and learned more of what was happening in Italy, did he 
		publicly denounce the regime, publishing a letter to the <i>Manchester 
		Guardian</i> in August. The next month, Popolo d'Italia, the magazine 
		edited by Benito Mussolini's brother, replied: &quot;Who cares? Italy laughs 
		at Tagore and those who brought this unctuous and insupportable fellow 
		in our midst.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With his high 
		expectations of Britain, Tagore continued to be surprised by what he 
		took to be a lack of official sympathy for international victims of 
		aggression. He returned to this theme in the lecture he gave on his last 
		birthday, in 1941:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">While 
			Japan was quietly devouring North China, her act of wanton 
			aggression was ignored as a minor incident by the veterans of 
			British diplomacy. We have also witnessed from this distance how 
			actively the British statesmen acquiesced in the destruction of the 
			Spanish Republic.</span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But 
		distinguishing between the British government and the British people, 
		Rabindranath went on to note &quot;with admiration how a band of valiant 
		Englishmen laid down their lives for Spain.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore's view 
		of the Soviet Union has been a subject of much discussion. He was widely 
		read in Russia. In 1917 several Russian translations of <i>Gitanjali</i> 
		(one edited by
		<a href="http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1933/index.html">
		Ivan Bunin</a>, later the first Russian Nobel Laureate in Literature) 
		were available, and by the late 1920s many of the English versions of 
		his work had been rendered into Russian by several distinguished 
		translators. Russian versions of his work continued to appear: Boris 
		Pasternak translated him in the 1950s and 1960s.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Tagore 
		visited Russia in 1930, he was much impressed by its development efforts 
		and by what he saw as a real commitment to eliminate poverty and 
		economic inequality. But what impressed him most was the expansion of 
		basic education across the old Russian empire. In Letters from Russia, 
		written in Bengali and published in 1931, he unfavorably compares the 
		acceptance of widespread illiteracy in India by the British 
		administration with Russian efforts to expand education:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">In 
			stepping on the soil of Russia, the first thing that caught my eye 
			was that in education, at any rate, the peasant and the working 
			classes have made such enormous progress in these few years that 
			nothing comparable has happened even to our highest classes in the 
			course of the last hundred and fifty years…. The people here are not 
			at all afraid of giving complete education even to Turcomans of 
			distant Asia; on the contrary, they are utterly in earnest about it.
			<a href="#26"><sup>26</sup></a></span> </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When parts of 
		the book were translated into English in 1934, the under-secretary for 
		India stated in Parliament that it was &quot;calculated by distortion of the 
		facts to bring the British Administration in India into contempt and 
		disrepute,&quot; and the book was then promptly banned. The English version 
		would not be published until after independence.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="o" name="o"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">Education and Freedom</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The British 
		Indian administrators were not, however, alone in trying to suppress 
		Tagore's reflections on Russia. They were joined by Soviet officials. In 
		an interview with <i>Izvestia</i> in 1930, Tagore sharply criticized the 
		lack of freedom that he observed in Russia:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">I must 
			ask you: Are you doing your ideal a service by arousing in the minds 
			of those under your training anger, class-hatred, and revengefulness 
			against those whom you consider to be your enemies?… Freedom of mind 
			is needed for the reception of truth; terror hopelessly kills it…. 
			For the sake of humanity I hope you may never create a vicious force 
			of violence, which will go on weaving an interminable chain of 
			violence and cruelty…. You have tried to destroy many of the other 
			evils of [the czarist] period. Why not try to destroy this one also?</span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The interview 
		was not published in <i>Izvestia</i> until 1988—nearly sixty years 
		later.<sup><a href="#27">27</a></sup> Tagore's reaction to the Russia of 
		1930 arose from two of his strongest commitments: his uncompromising 
		belief in the importance of &quot;freedom of mind&quot; (the source of his 
		criticism of the Soviet Union), and his conviction that the expansion of 
		basic education is central to social progress (the source of his praise, 
		particularly in contrast to British-run India). He identified the lack 
		of basic education as the fundamental cause of many of India's social 
		and economic afflictions:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">In my 
			view the imposing tower of misery which today rests on the heart of 
			India has its sole foundation in the absence of education. Caste 
			divisions, religious conflicts, aversion to work, precarious 
			economic conditions - all centre on this single factor.</span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was on 
		education (and on the reflection, dialogue, and communication that are 
		associated with it), rather than on, say, spinning &quot;as a sacrifice&quot; 
		(&quot;the charka does not require anyone to think&quot;), that the future of 
		India would depend.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was 
		concerned not only that there be wider opportunities for education 
		across the country (especially in rural areas where schools were few), 
		but also that the schools themselves be more lively and enjoyable. He 
		himself had dropped out of school early, largely out of boredom, and had 
		never bothered to earn a diploma. He wrote extensively on how schools 
		should be made more attractive to boys and girls and thus more 
		productive. His own co-educational school at Santiniketan had many 
		progressive features. The emphasis here was on self-motivation rather 
		than on discipline, and on fostering intellectual curiosity rather than 
		competitive excellence.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Much of 
		Rabindranath's life was spent in developing the school at Santiniketan. 
		The school never had much money, since the fees were very low. His 
		lecture honoraria, &quot;$700 a scold,&quot; went to support it, as well as most 
		of his Nobel Prize money. The school received no support from the 
		government, but did get help from private citizens—even Mahatma Gandhi 
		raised money for it.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dispute 
		with Mahatma Gandhi on the Bihar earthquake touched on a subject that 
		was very important to Tagore: the need for education in science as well 
		as in literature and the humanities. At Santiniketan, there were strong 
		&quot;local&quot; elements in its emphasis on Indian traditions, including the 
		classics, and in the use of Bengali rather than English as the language 
		of instruction. At the same time there were courses on a great variety 
		of cultures, and study programs devoted to China, Japan, and the Middle 
		East. Many foreigners came to Santiniketan to study or teach, and the 
		fusion of studies seemed to work.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am partial 
		to seeing Tagore as an educator, having myself been educated at 
		Santiniketan. The school was unusual in many different ways, such as the 
		oddity that classes, excepting those requiring a laboratory, were held 
		outdoors (whenever the weather permitted). No matter what we thought of 
		Rabindranath's belief that one gains from being in a natural setting 
		while learning (some of us argued about this theory), we typically found 
		the experience of outdoor schooling extremely attractive and pleasant. 
		Academically, our school was not particularly exacting (often we did not 
		have any examinations at all), and it could not, by the usual academic 
		standards, compete with some of the better schools in Calcutta. But 
		there was something remarkable about the ease with which class 
		discussions could move from Indian traditional literature to 
		contemporary as well as classical Western thought, and then to the 
		culture of China or Japan or elsewhere. The school's celebration of 
		variety was also in sharp contrast with the cultural conservatism and 
		separatism that has tended to grip India from time to time.<br>
		The cultural give and take of Tagore's vision of the contemporary world 
		has close parallels with the vision of Satyajit Ray, also an alumnus of 
		Santiniketan who made several films based on Tagore's stories.<sup><a href="#28">28</a></sup> 
		Ray's words about Santiniketan in 1991 would have greatly pleased 
		Rabindranath:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">I 
			consider the three years I spent in Santiniketan as the most 
			fruitful of my life…. Santiniketan opened my eyes for the first time 
			to the splendours of Indian and Far Eastern art. Until then I was 
			completely under the sway of Western art, music and literature. 
			Santiniketan made me the combined product of East and West that I 
			am.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup></span> </font></p>

		<h3 style="text-align: justify"><a id="p" name="p"></a>
		<font face="Verdana">India Today</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the 
		fiftieth anniversary of Indian independence, the reckoning of what India 
		had or had not achieved in this half century was a subject of 
		considerable interest: &quot;What has been the story of those first fifty 
		years?&quot; (as Shashi Tharoor asked in his balanced, informative, and 
		highly readable account of <i>India: From Midnight to the Millennium</i>).<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> 
		If Tagore were to see the India of today, more than half a century after 
		independence, nothing perhaps would shock him so much as the continued 
		illiteracy of the masses. He would see this as a total betrayal of what 
		the nationalist leaders had promised during the struggle for 
		independence—a promise that had figured even in Nehru's rousing speech 
		on the eve of independence in August 1947 (on India's &quot;tryst with 
		destiny&quot;).</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In view of 
		his interest in childhood education, Tagore would not be consoled by the 
		extraordinary expansion of university education, in which India sends to 
		its universities six times as many people per unit of population as does 
		China. Rather, he would be stunned that, in contrast to East and 
		Southeast Asia, including China, half the adult population and two 
		thirds of Indian women remain unable to read or write. Statistically 
		reliable surveys indicate that even in the late 1980s, nearly half of 
		the rural girls between the ages of twelve and fourteen did not attend 
		any school for a single day of their lives.<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup></font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This state of 
		affairs is the result of the continuation of British imperial neglect of 
		mass education, which has been reinforced by India's traditional 
		elitism, as well as upper-class-dominated contemporary politics (except 
		in parts of India such as Kerala, where anti-upper-caste movements have 
		tended to concentrate on education as a great leveller). Tagore would 
		see illiteracy and the neglect of education not only as the main source 
		of India's continued social backwardness, but also as a great constraint 
		that restricts the possibility and reach of economic development in 
		India (as his writings on rural development forcefully make clear). 
		Tagore would also have strongly felt the need for a greater 
		commitment—and a greater sense of urgency—in removing endemic poverty.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the same 
		time, Tagore would undoubtedly find some satisfaction in the survival of 
		democracy in India, in its relatively free press, and in general from 
		the &quot;freedom of mind&quot; that post-independence Indian politics has, on the 
		whole, managed to maintain. He would also be pleased by the fact noted 
		by the historian E.P. Thompson (whose father Edward Thompson had written 
		one of the first major biographies of Tagore:<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup></font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">All the 
			convergent influences of the world run through this society: Hindu, 
			Moslem, Christian, secular; Stalinist, liberal, Maoist, democratic 
			socialist, Gandhian. There is not a thought that is being thought in 
			the West or East that is not active in some Indian mind.<sup><a href="#33">33</a></sup></span>
			</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore would 
		have been happy also to see that the one governmental attempt to 
		dispense generally with basic liberties and political and civil rights 
		in India, in the 1970s, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (ironically, 
		herself a former student at Santiniketan) declared an &quot;emergency,&quot; was 
		overwhelmingly rejected by the Indian voters, leading to the precipitate 
		fall of her government.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		would also see that the changes in policy that have eliminated famine 
		since independence had much to do with the freedom to be heard in a 
		democratic India. In Tagore's play <i>Raja O Rani</i> (&quot;The King and the 
		Queen&quot;), the sympathetic Queen eventually rebels against the callousness 
		of state policy toward the hungry. She begins by inquiring about the 
		ugly sounds outside the palace, only to be told that the noise is coming 
		from &quot;the coarse, clamorous crowd who howl unashamedly for food and 
		disturb the sweet peace of the palace.&quot; The Viceregal office in India 
		could have taken a similarly callous view of Indian famines, right up to 
		the easily preventable Bengal famine of 1943, just before independence, 
		which killed between two and three million people. But a government in a 
		multi-party democracy, with elections and free newspapers, cannot any 
		longer dismiss the noise from &quot;the coarse, clamorous crowd.&quot;<sup><a href="#34">34</a></sup></font></p>

		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unlike 
		Gandhi, Rabindranath would not resent the development of modern 
		industries in India, or the acceleration of technical progress, since he 
		did not want India to be shackled to the turning of &quot;the wheel of an 
		antiquated invention.&quot; Tagore was concerned that people not be dominated 
		by machines, but he was not opposed to making good use of modern 
		technology. &quot;The mastery over the machine,&quot; he wrote in <i>Crisis in 
		Civilization,</i> &quot;by which the British have consolidated their 
		sovereignty over their vast empire, has been kept a sealed book, to 
		which due access has been denied to this helpless country.&quot; Rabindranath 
		had a deep interest in the environment - he was particularly concerned 
		about deforestation and initiated a &quot;festival of tree-planting&quot; 
		(vriksha-ropana) as early as 1928. He would want increased private and 
		government commitments to environmentalism; but he would not derive from 
		this position a general case against modern industry and technology.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">On Cultural Separation</font></h3>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		would be shocked by the growth of cultural separatism in India, as 
		elsewhere. The &quot;openness&quot; that he valued so much is certainly under 
		great strain right now - in many countries. Religious fundamentalism 
		still has a relatively small following in India; but various factions 
		seem to be doing their best to increase their numbers. Certainly 
		religious sectarianism has had much success in some parts of India 
		(particularly in the west and the north). Tagore would see the expansion 
		of religious sectarianism as being closely associated with an 
		artificially separatist view of culture.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He would have 
		strongly resisted defining India in specifically Hindu terms, rather 
		than as a &quot;confluence&quot; of many cultures. Even after the partition of 
		1947, India is still the third- largest Muslim country in the world, 
		with more Muslims than in Bangladesh, and nearly as many as in Pakistan. 
		Only Indonesia has substantially more followers of Islam. Indeed, by 
		pointing to the immense heterogeneousness of India's cultural background 
		and its richly diverse history, Tagore had argued that the &quot;idea of 
		India&quot; itself militated against a culturally separatist view—&quot;against 
		the intense consciousness of the separateness of one's own people from 
		others.&quot;</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore would 
		also oppose the cultural nationalism that has recently been gaining some 
		ground in India, along with an exaggerated fear of the influence of the 
		West. He was uncompromising in his belief that human beings could absorb 
		quite different cultures in constructive ways:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="quote">Whatever 
			we understand and enjoy in human products instantly becomes ours, 
			wherever they might have their origin. I am proud of my humanity 
			when I can acknowledge the poets and artists of other countries as 
			my own. Let me feel with unalloyed gladness that all the great 
			glories of man are mine. Therefore it hurts me deeply when the cry 
			of rejection rings loud against the West in my country with the 
			clamour that Western education can only injure us.</span> </font>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this 
		context, it is important to emphasize that Rabindranath was not short of 
		pride in India's own heritage, and often spoke about it. He lectured at 
		Oxford, with evident satisfaction, on the importance of India's 
		religious ideas—quoting both from ancient texts and from popular poetry 
		(such as the verses of the sixteenth-century Muslim poet Kabir). In 
		1940, when he was given an honorary doctorate by Oxford University, in a 
		ceremony arranged at his own educational establishment in Santiniketan 
		(&quot;In Gangem Defluit Isis,&quot; Oxford helpfully explained), to the 
		predictable &quot;volley of Latin&quot; Tagore responded &quot;by a volley of 
		Sanskrit,&quot; as Marjorie Sykes, a Quaker friend of Rabindranath, reports. 
		Her cheerful summary of the match, &quot;India held its own,&quot; was not out of 
		line with Tagore's pride in Indian culture. His welcoming attitude to 
		Western civilization was reinforced by this confidence: he did not see 
		India's culture as fragile and in need of &quot;protection&quot; from Western 
		influence.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India, he 
		wrote, &quot;circumstances almost compel us to learn English, and this lucky 
		accident has given us the opportunity of access into the richest of all 
		poetical literatures of the world.&quot; There seems to me much force in 
		Rabindranath's argument for clearly distinguishing between the injustice 
		of a serious asymmetry of power (colonialism being a prime example of 
		this) and the importance nevertheless of appraising Western culture in 
		an open-minded way, in colonial and postcolonial territories, in order 
		to see what uses could be made of it.</font></p>
		<p class="normaltext" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath 
		insisted on open debate on every issue, and distrusted conclusions based 
		on a mechanical formula, no matter how attractive that formula might 
		seem in isolation (such as &quot;This was forced on us by our colonial 
		masters - we must reject it,&quot; &quot;This is our tradition—we must follow it,&quot; 
		&quot;We have promised to do this—we must fulfill that promise,&quot; and so on). 
		The question he persistently asks is whether we have reason enough to 
		want what is being proposed, taking everything into account. Important 
		as history is, reasoning has to go beyond the past. It is in the 
		sovereignty of reasoning—fearless reasoning in freedom—that we can find 
		Rabindranath Tagore's lasting voice.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup></font></p>
