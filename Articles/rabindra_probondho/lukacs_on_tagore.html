	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">Tagore’s enormous 
	celebrity among Germany’s ‘intellectual elite’ is one of the cultural 
	scandals occurring with ever greater intensity again and again — a typical 
	sign of the total cultural dissolution facing this ‘intellectual elite’. For 
	such celebrity indicates the complete loss of the old ability to distinguish 
	between the genuine article and the fake.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">Tagore himself is 
	— as imaginative writer and as thinker — a wholly insignificant figure. His 
	creative powers are non-existent; his characters pale stereotypes; his 
	stories threadbare and uninteresting; and his sensibility is meagre, 
	insubstantial. <b>He survives by stirring scraps of the Upanishads and the 
	Bhagavad-Gita into his works </b>amid the sluggish flow of his own 
	tediousness — and because the contemporary German reader’s instinct has 
	become so unsure that he can no longer recognise the difference between the 
	text and quotations. As a result these scanty leftovers from Indian 
	philosophy do not annihilate the unworthy material which frames them; on the 
	contrary, they give it an esoteric sanction of profundity and of wisdom from 
	afar. That is not surprising. When Germany’s educated public is 
	accommodating itself more and more to intellectual substitutes, when it is 
	incapable of grasping the difference between Spangler and classical 
	philosophy, between Ewers and Hoffmann or Poe and so forth, how is it to 
	perceive this difference in the far remoter world of India? Tagore is the 
	Indian Frenssen,</span></font><sup><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Verdana"><a href="#1._">[1]</a></span></sup><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US"> 
	whom he faintly recalls in his unctuous tediousness, although his creative 
	powers even fall short of Frenssen. All the same, his great success has some 
	significance as a symptom of the German mentality today.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">A possible 
	response to this sharp rejection of Tagore is to invoke an international 
	fame (or rather, fame in Britain). The English bourgeoisie has reasons of 
	its own for rewarding Mr. Tagore with fame and riches (the Nobel Prize): it 
	is repaying its intellectual agent in the struggle against the Indian 
	freedom movement. For Britain, therefore, the scraps of ‘wisdom’ from 
	ancient India, the doctrine of total acquiescence and of the wickedness of 
	violence — only, of course, <b>when it relates to the freedom movement — 
	have a very concrete and palpable meaning. The greater Tagore’s fame and 
	authority, the more effectively his pamphlet can combat the freedom struggle 
	in his native country.</b></span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">For a pamphlet — 
	and one resorting to the lowest tools of libel — is what Tagore’s novel is, 
	in spite of its tediousness and want of spirit. These libels seem all the 
	more repugnant to the unprejudiced reader the more they are steeped in 
	unctuous ‘wisdom’ and the more slyly <b>Mr. Tagore attempts to conceal his 
	impotent hatred of the Indian freedom fighters in a ‘profound’ philosophy of 
	the ‘universally human’.</b></span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">The intellectual 
	conflict in the novel is concerned with the question of the use of violence. 
	The author portrays the beginnings of the national movement: the struggle to 
	boycott British goods, to squeeze them out of the Indian market and to 
	replace them with native products. And Mr. Tagore broaches the weighty 
	question: is the use of violence in this struggle morally admissible? <b>The 
	hypothesis is that India is an oppressed, enslaved country, yet Mr. Tagore 
	shows no interest in this question. He is, after all, a philosopher, a 
	moralist only concerned with the ‘eternal truths’.</b> Let the British come 
	to terms as they wish and in their own way with the damage done to their 
	souls through their use of violence: <em>Mr. Tagore’s task is to save the 
	Indians spiritually and to protect their souls</em> from the dangers posed 
	by the violence, deceit etc. with which they are waging their struggle for 
	freedom. He writes: “Men who die for the truth are immortal; and if a whole 
	people dies for the truth it will achieve immortality in the history of 
	mankind.’</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US"><b>This stance 
	represents nothing less than the ideology of the eternal subjection of 
	India. But Tagore’s attitude is even more blatantly manifest in the manner 
	in which he shapes this demand in the action and the characters of his 
	novel.</b> The movement which he depicts is a romantic movement for 
	intellectuals. It strongly reminds us — without taking the analogy too far, 
	since the social circumstances are entirely different — of such movements as 
	the Carbonari in Italy and indeed, in certain aspects (particularly the 
	psychological aspects), the Narodniks in Russia. Romantic Utopianism, 
	ideological exaggeration and the crusading spirit are an essential part of 
	all these movements. But this is only the starting point for Mr. Tagore’s 
	libellous pamphlet. He turns this crusading romanticism, whose <em>typical 
	representatives</em> were without question motivated by the purest idealism 
	and self-sacrifice, into a life of adventure and crime. His hero, a minor 
	Indian noble who advocates the current doctrine, is destroyed both inwardly 
	and outwardly by the rapacious excesses of such a ‘patriotic’ criminal band. 
	His home is destroyed. He himself falls in a battle that was sparked off by 
	the unscrupulousness of the ‘patriots’. He himself is supposed, according to 
	Mr. Tagore, to be by no means hostile to the national movement; on the 
	contrary, he even wants to promote the nation’s industry. He experiments 
	with native inventions — provided, though, that he does not pay for them. He 
	gives shelter to the patriots’ leader, a contemptible caricature of Gandhi! 
	But when the affair becomes too hot for him, he protects everybody afflicted 
	by the violence of the ‘patriots’ with his own instruments of power and with 
	those of the British police.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">This 
	propagandistic, demagogically one-sided stance renders the novel completely 
	worthless from the artistic angle. The hero’s adversary is not a real 
	adversary but a base adventurer who, for instance, when he wheedles a large 
	sum of money out of the hero’s wife for national ends and talks her into 
	theft, does not hand the money over to the national movement but feasts on 
	the sight of the gleaming pieces of gold. No wonder the men and women whom 
	he has led astray turn away from him in disgust the moment they see through 
	him.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">But Tagore’s 
	creative powers do not even stretch to a decent pamphlet. He lacks the 
	imagination even to calumniate convincingly and effectively, as Dostoyevsky, 
	say, partly succeeded in doing in his counter-revolutionary novel 
	‘Possessed’. The ‘spiritual’ aspect of his story, separated from the nuggets 
	of Indian wisdom with which it is tricked out, is a petty bourgeois yarn of 
	the shoddiest kind. Ultimately it boils down to the ‘problem’ of the 
	standing of the ‘man of the house’: how the wife of a ‘good and honest’ man 
	is seduced by a romantic adventurer, but then sees through him and returns 
	to her husband in remorse.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">This brief sample 
	will suffice to give an impression of the ‘great man’ whom German 
	intellectuals have treated like a prophet. To rebut such totally dismissive 
	criticism, of course, his admirers will point to his other, ‘more universal’ 
	writings. In our view, however, the significance of an intellectual trend is 
	evident precisely from what it can say about the most burning contemporary 
	questions -if it presumes to point the way in an age of confusion. Indeed 
	the value or worthlessness of a theory or outlook (and of those who proclaim 
	it) is evident precisely from what it has to say to the people of that age 
	in their sufferings and their strivings. It is difficult to assess wisdom 
	‘in itself’ in the vacuum of pure theory (and within the walls of an elegant 
	salon). But <b>it will reveal itself the moment that it comes out with the 
	claim to act as men’s guide.</b> <b>Mr. Tagore has come out with that claim 
	in this novel. As we noted, his ‘wisdom’ was put at the intellectual service 
	of the British police. Is it necessary, therefore, to pay any closer 
	attention to the residue of this ‘wisdom'?</b></span></font></p>
