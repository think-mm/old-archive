	<p><b>Ghare Baire [The Home and the World] (1915) Author: Tagore, 
	Rabindranath. Domain: Literature. Genre: Novel. Country: India, South Asia.
	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Set against the backdrop of the <em>
	swadeshi</em> (home rule) movement in Bengal, following its sudden and 
	arbitrary partition by the then British viceroy in India, Lord Curzon, in 
	1905, <em>The</em> <em>Home and the World</em> was originally published in 
	Bengali (as <em>Ghare Baire</em>) in 1915. Later, it was translated and 
	published in English by the author’s nephew, Surendranath Tagore (with 
	active cooperation from the author himself), in 1919. The Bengali original 
	was published two years after the author was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
	Literature and the same year in which he received a knighthood from King 
	George V of England – an accolade he came to renounce in 1919 in protest 
	against the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre in Punjab, by the notorious General 
	Dyer. It is perhaps the best known of Tagore’s novels outside Bengal, and 
	received a lot of attention in Europe, particularly following the 
	publication of its English translation, mainly due to the wide readership 
	Tagore had gained in the wake of his Nobel award. The controversial nature 
	of the subject matter, in which Tagore takes the opportunity to launch his 
	fiercest attack yet against the ideology of nationalism, contrary to its 
	rising popularity both in India and the West, was also a reason it drew much 
	attention, mostly in the form of reprobation and scorn, from readers both in 
	and outside Bengal. A third reason for the novel’s reputation is the 
	successful movie made of it, in 1984, by another gifted scion of Bengal, and 
	a student of Tagore’s university, Visva-Bharati, Satyajit Ray. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Upon its publication, the novel was 
	praised by Tagore’s friends William Rothenstein and W.B. Yeats, and a friend 
	of Einstein’s advised him in an upbeat tone, “You <em>must</em> read [it] – 
	the finest novel I’ve read for a long time” (italics in original). Hermann 
	Hesse, reviewing it, spoke of its “purity and grandeur”, and Bertolt Brecht 
	observed in his diary, “A wonderful book, strong and gentle.” However, E.M. 
	Forster and George Lukács did not find much positive in the novel. In a 
	condescending tone, Forster dismissed the book as a “tragedy… about 
	nothing”; “a ‘roman à trios’ with all the hackneyed situations from which 
	novelists are trying to emancipate themselves in the West.”
	<a href="lukacs_on_tagore.htm">Lukács proved more vitriolic</a>; he 
	condemned the novel as a “libellous pamphlet” and “petty bourgeoisie yarn of 
	the shoddiest kind.” He added that Tagore was but an “intellectual agent [of 
	the empire, acting] against the Indian freedom movement” in the novel – a 
	view that a Russian scholar of Tagore, Alexander P. Danielschuk, later 
	spurned as an example of vulgar Marxism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore never had a political 
	temperament and found politics wasteful and morally debilitating; it is 
	politics, he said, “which in every country has lowered the standard of 
	morality, [and] given rise to a perpetual contest of lies and deception, 
	cruelties and hypocrisies.” A poet, he sought to keep his mind above 
	politics. However his destiny determined otherwise: “I have been chosen by 
	destiny to ply my boat there where the current is against me”; “Politics is 
	wholly against my nature; and yet, belonging to an unfortunate country, born 
	to an abnormal situation, we find it so difficult to avoid their [sic] 
	outbursts.” When the <em>swadeshi</em> movement broke out in Bengal, in the 
	wake of its partition in 1905, Tagore soon found himself at its vortex: 
	writing songs, giving speeches, and taking part in mass rallies. He also set 
	up a match factory, a local bank, and a weaving centre as his way of giving 
	leadership to the movement. Ironically, he even set the movement’s theme 
	song, <em>Bande Mataram</em>, or “Hail to thee Mother”, to music himself. 
	The song was composed by another Bengali writer, Bankim Chatterjee, and is 
	used as a potent fetish by the manipulative Sandip in the novel. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Swadeshi</em> literally means 
	“of our own country”. It was a nationalist movement meant to boycott British 
	goods and buy homemade products, so that the British would suffer 
	economically for their dark designs of divide and rule policy, while the 
	local industries grew, with less competition from imported goods. But what 
	was conceived as a non-violent non-cooperation movement soon turned violent 
	and ugly, owing to the heavy handed policies of the government, and wilful 
	meddling by self-seeking and sinister <em>bhadroloks</em>. Tagore felt 
	mortified by many of the nationalist leaders behaving like terrorists and 
	traumatising innocent people for their indifference to the cause, and 
	impassioned youths turning to the cult of the bomb to liberate their 
	homeland from the foreign yoke. Thus, especially after Khudiram Bose, a 
	radical youth who is still widely regarded as a hero in the annals of 
	Bengal, hurled a bomb in 1908, killing two innocent British civilians, 
	Tagore decided not to participate in the movement any more, nor associate 
	with a nationalist uprising again, in spite of the recurrent charges of 
	pusillanimity and insincerity by his detractors. His response came, instead, 
	in the form of <em>The Home and the World</em>, seven years later. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The novel deals with the experiences 
	of three characters during the volatile period of <em>swadeshi</em>: Nikhil 
	(whose name means “free”), a benevolent, enlightened and progressive <em>
	zamindar</em> (landlord); his childhood friend and a voluble, selfish but 
	charismatic nationalist leader, Sandip; and Nikhil’s wife, Bimala 
	(“pristine”), who is happy at the outset in her traditional role as a 
	zamindar’s wife but who, encouraged by her husband, steps out of home to 
	better acquaint herself with the world and find a new identity for the 
	Indian woman. At the sight of Sandip, she emotionally trips, vacillates 
	between him and her husband, until she returns home bruised and humiliated 
	but with a more mature understanding of both the home/self and the world. 
	The narrative is structured in the form of diary entries written by the 
	three characters. This technique allows the reader to see the events in 
	multiple perspectives, and comprehend their relative effects on the mind of 
	these characters, but the psychological probing in these extended diary 
	monologues also slows down the novel’s progress, making it somewhat 
	repetitive and static, with fewer real incidents and dramatic actions 
	featuring in the narrative. This method of telling also gives rise to long, 
	confessional/descriptive passages, often effusive, sentimental and strung on 
	a high moral key, which might sound false and tedious to the western ear but 
	which was an integral part of the Bengali style, particularly for Tagore who 
	was at once a poet, philosopher and novelist. As his biographer, Krishna 
	Kripalani has aptly pointed out, “Tagore was no Tolstoy or Balzac… [a 
	myriad-minded writer] the poet, the singer and the teacher constantly 
	meddled with the novelist.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The novel has a certain allegorical 
	quality in that Nikhil and Sandip seem to represent two opposing visions for 
	the nation – with Bimala, torn between the two, not knowing for sure what 
	should be her guiding principle – signifying Bengal tottering between the 
	two possibilities. Nikhil’s vision is one of enlightened humanitarian and 
	global perspective, based on a true equality and harmony of individuals and 
	nations. On the other hand, Sandip’s radical, parochial and belligerent 
	nationalism, which cultivates an intense sense of patriotism in individuals, 
	threatenes to replace their moral sensibility with national bigotry and 
	blind fanaticism. Seen from this perspective, Nikhil’s death at the end of 
	the novel, just when Bimala is turning the corner and returning to her 
	senses after a prolonged infatuation with Sandip and his views, also signals 
	Tagore’s pessimism about the future of Bengal. In the absence of truly 
	benevolent leaders like Nikhil, she would be mutilated, divided in two 
	(currently Bangladesh and West Bengal), with millions of her children paying 
	with their lives to meet the apocalyptic wishes of self-seeking, immoral, 
	power-hungry politicians, determined to carve out her body on religious 
	communal lines. By extension, it also shows Tagore’s despondent thoughts 
	about the future of humanity at large, who, forgetting their human potential 
	for truth, equality, fellowship and justice, would espouse a vision that 
	would lock them in a binary of self and other. The consequences of such 
	thinking, Tagore warns, is a recurrent logic of greed, selfishness, 
	violence, hatred and war – a dark prediction also made in an earlier poem, 
	“The Sunset of the Century,” written on the last day of the nineteenth 
	century: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The hungry self of the Nation 
		shall burst in a violence of fury from its shameless feeding. <br>
		For it has made the world its food. <br>
		And licking it, crunching it and swallowing it in big morsels, <br>
		It swells and swells<br>
		Till in the midst of its unholy feast descends the sudden shaft of 
		heaven piercing its heart of grossness. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The embodiment of ideas by the 
	characters is a weakness in the novel, but perhaps a necessary compromise by 
	the writer. It makes the characters flat and one-dimensional: Nikhil, who 
	has too much of Tagore in him, is emblematic of all good; and Sandip, who is 
	Nikhil’s polar opposite, is all unscrupulousness and evil. Neither of these 
	characters seems to change in the course of the narrative. Nikhil remains 
	calm, gentle, understanding, forgiving, liberal, rational and altruistic 
	throughout the novel, while Sandip is selfish, manipulative, irrational, 
	oppressive, and tyrannical. Nikhil is so tranquil that he does not lose his 
	poise even when his wife flirts with his friend in his own house, in front 
	of his very eyes. His logic is: “Perfect gain is the best of all; but if 
	that is impossible, then the next best gain is perfect losing” (24). This is 
	extraordinary indeed considering that, in the Indian patriarchal system, men 
	take their wives for granted, hardly allowing any complex emotions to occur 
	in their relationships with women, especially in marriage. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nikhil loves Bimala wholeheartedly, 
	but Bimala must appraise that on her own and reciprocate his love 
	voluntarily. If she decides otherwise, it will be devastating for Nikhil, 
	but he must allow her free choice, especially since he loves her: in love 
	there is no place for tyranny. He hopes that Bimala’s sexual and ideological 
	obsession with Sandip is a passing phase in her process of maturing and 
	coming to grips with the larger world; the spell will break soon and she 
	will return to her senses again. Meanwhile he should wait and not lose 
	faith. If she considers otherwise, that is of course his fate. Nikhil 
	argues: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The passage from the narrow to 
		the larger world is stormy. When she is familiar with this freedom, then 
		I shall know where my place is. If I discover that I do not fit in with 
		the arrangement of the outer world, then I shall not quarrel with my 
		fate, but silently take my leave… Use force? But for what? Can force 
		prevail against Truth? (45) </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is no doubt Tagore’s way of 
	dismantling the age-old role model of Sita – the all-sacrificing and 
	faithful wife of Rama. In the epic <em>Ramayana</em>, Sita clings to her 
	husband in spite of the latter’s dishonourable behaviour toward her by 
	repeatedly questioning her integrity and innocence, whilst he accuses her of 
	having lost her chastity with Ravana, notwithstanding her several <em>
	agniparikshas</em> to prove her righteousness. Discarding this ideal of 
	complete submission, Tagore instead presents an alternative model for Indian 
	women, the empowering ideal of Durga, the warrior goddess and embodiment of
	<em>Shakti</em> (the primal feminine power, indispensable to creation). 
	Although Durga, the wife of Shiva, is calm, domestic and restrained, most 
	importantly she is strong, courageous and independent. Thus, throughout the 
	novel, Bimala is associated with Durga, Kali and <em>Shakti</em>, instead of 
	Sita or Savitri (another model of feminine virtue and devotion in the <em>
	Mahabharata</em>). By allowing Bimala freedom of choice, Tagore has 
	highlighted the potential of Indian women and their right to emancipation.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nikhil’s honesty, altruism and 
	idealism is, however, matched by his friend’s cunning, cupidity and flagrant 
	narcissism. Nikhil appears divine, while Sandip is diabolic; Nikhil is 
	endowed with all the traits of a <em>sattvic</em> as described in the <em>
	Bhagavad Gita</em>: his dominant element is light and therefore he is wise, 
	intelligent, progressive and pure, while Sandip is a <em>rajasik</em>, a 
	personality framed with fire and therefore greedy, violent and destructive. 
	His philosophy is as simple as it can be for a Machiavellian: “There is not 
	the time for nice scruples. We must be unswervingly, unreasoningly brutal. 
	We must sin” (39), he admonishes Nikhil, and adds matter-of-factly, “Every 
	man has a natural right to possess, and therefore greed is natural…. What my 
	mind covets, my surrounding must supply” (45). Elsewhere he argues, “We are 
	the flesh-eaters of the world; we have teeth and nails; we pursue and grab 
	and tear. We are not satisfied with chewing in the evening the cud of grass 
	we have eaten in the morning…. In that case we shall steal or rob, for we 
	must live” (47). This sounds like the morality of Swift’s Yahoos, but it is 
	also the morality of the modern materialist-capitalist West that Sandip 
	essentially emulates, vis-à-vis Nikhil’s home grown Indian wisdom mediated 
	by the wholesome and humane values of the Judaeo-Christian civilization.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, Sandip is so recklessly 
	selfish and unscrupulous that he does not hesitate to woo his friend’s wife 
	while living under his roof, or to incite her to rob her own husband. He 
	provokes the youths of Nikhil’s village to calculated violence against their 
	poor, innocent neighbours just so as to terrorise them into accepting his 
	viewpoint, and arouses Nikhil’s subjects into a bloody religious riot, of 
	which Nikhil himself becomes a deadly victim at the end, thus paying with 
	his life for the benevolence done to a friend who seems every bit a 
	scoundrel. Anita Desai is right in pointing out that in his vanity, 
	arrogance, greed and nihilism, Sandip “resembles nothing so much as the 
	conventional blackguard of the Indian stage or the Bombay cinema, stroking 
	his handlebar moustache as he gloats over a bag of gold and a cowering 
	maiden.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This reductive approach of Tagore in 
	creating “a simple box of figures – not more than a Punch and Judy showman 
	uses for his own little drama,” as his friend Rothenstein incisively pointed 
	out (though ironically meaning this as a tribute to the writer), is 
	certainly an artistic blemish in the work. Tagore has no doubt failed to 
	achieve creative detachment in <em>The Home and the World, </em>owing to his 
	overwhelming sympathy for Nikhil’s liberal, global ideology against Sandip’s 
	commercial-capitalistic-nationalistic worldview, which he completely 
	rejects. Perhaps this artistic compromise was made deliberately by the 
	writer, considering the significance of his message. After all, Tagore was 
	working against the mainstream ideas of Indian and world politics. Therefore 
	he had to keep his characters simple and one-dimensional, so that his 
	statement would emerge firmly and clearly. Besides, this four-square 
	approach of pitting good against evil can be seen as a part of the Indian 
	imagination, as we see in the struggles between the sons of Pandavas and the 
	sons of Kauravas in the <em>Mahabharata</em>, or Rama and Ravana in the <em>
	Ramayana</em>, or the mythical stories of Lakhsmi and Alakhsmi, Durga and 
	Mahesa and Kali and Raktabija (or those ever predictable Bollywood movies 
	that Desai mentions). As R.K. Narayan has put it succinctly, the underlying 
	objective of every Indian story is to create a “distinction between good and 
	evil” and show that “goodness triumphs in the end… if not immediately, at 
	least in a thousand years; if not in this world, at least in other worlds.” 
	Despite Tagore’s apparent cynicism in the novel, that hope that eventually 
	everything will come out right is also somehow expressed by the writer, 
	since he never lost hope in the infinitude of the human soul and the 
	Upanishadic idea of human being’s divine inheritance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore and Nikhil share the view 
	that we are all part and parcel of a self-luminous Brahman, that we are 
	various strings of the universal supreme self; that what is in the macrocosm 
	is also in the microcosm; that, like the petals of a rose, we are all 
	attached to the stem of humanity by the bond of love. Thus, it is incumbent 
	upon humankind to work towards a global society, built upon the principles 
	of inclusivity, equality and mutuality of all human beings, instead of 
	indulging in the ideal of nationalism, which cultivates parochialism, 
	binarism and xenophobia, trapping people in a logic of egoism, exclusivism 
	and ignoble triumphalism. In his “Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech”, Tagore 
	advocates how India’s and the world’s sole objective should be to attain 
	global unity and shun the politics of nationalism, which violates man’s 
	inherent bond by generating hatred between nations and locking each in a 
	separate geographical cage:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not think that it is the 
		spirit of India to reject anything, reject any race, reject any culture. 
		The spirit of India has always proclaimed the ideal of unity…. Now, when 
		in the present time of political unrest the children of the same great 
		India cry for rejection of the West I feel hurt…. We must discover the 
		most profound unity, the spiritual unity between the different races. We 
		must go deeper down to the spirit of man and find out the great bond of 
		unity, which is to be found in all human races…. Man is not to fight 
		with other human races, other human individuals, but his work is to 
		bring about reconciliation and Peace and restore the bonds of friendship 
		and love. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nikhil expresses a similar global 
	sentiment throughout the novel and this comes to a head in an altercation 
	that he has with Sandip. Sandip arbitrarily equates god with nation, while 
	Nikhil establishes how it is imperative to bring together the entire human 
	community to find god, and how the cult of nationalism, through a 
	cultivation of national egoism and chauvinism, only thwarts that purpose:
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[Sandip] “I truly believe my 
		country to be my God. I worship Humanity. God manifests Himself in man 
		and in his country.” <br>
		[Nikhil] “If that is what you really believe, there should be no 
		difference for you between man and man, and so between country and 
		country.” <br>
		[Sandip] “Quite true. But my powers are limited, so my worship of 
		Humanity is continued in the worship of my country.” <br>
		[Nikhil] “I have nothing against your worship as such, but how is it you 
		propose to conduct your worship of God by hating other countries in 
		which He is equally manifest?” (37) </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nikhil’s teacher Chandranath Babu, 
	who acts as Nikhil’s moral guide and a wellspring for many of his ideas, is 
	even more pointed in his articulation of the Tagoresque global vision, when 
	he explains to his pupil: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I tell you, Nikhil, man’s 
		history has to be built by the united effort of all the races in the 
		world, and therefore this selling of conscience for political reasons – 
		this making a fetish of one’s country won’t do…. Here, in this land of 
		India, amid the mocking laughter of Satan piercing the sky, may the 
		feeling for this truth become real! What a terrible epidemic of sin has 
		been brought into our country from foreign lands. (224-25) </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Induced by such a noble, sublime, 
	and enlightened outlook, Nikhil acts as a true humanitarian in the novel. A
	<em>zamindar</em>, he never indulges in his office or wealth, but rather as 
	a benevolent patriarch he offers his utmost services to uplift the condition 
	of his people. He believes in the value of education and has been 
	instrumental in educating many of his subjects, some even accessing the 
	facilities in Calcutta owing to the generous scholarships provided by him. 
	This is his way of building the country; he believes that India can come out 
	of its social and cultural doldrums by reactivating the minds of its people, 
	and by redeeming itself from its decadent moral and religious values. It is 
	with this idea that he urges his wife to get modern education from an 
	English tutor he has appointed for her, Miss Gilby. Bimala, in order to 
	imaginatively comprehend the world and establish a healthy interactive 
	relationship between home/self/country and the world, ought to step beyond 
	the borders of her cultural tradition and dismantle her previously 
	monolithic sensibility with a more vibrant, symbiotic and synergic mode of 
	thought. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">August at heart, Nikhil knows no 
	racial, religious, class or sexual prejudice. When Miss Gilby is humiliated 
	by Sandip’s men, who have been indoctrinated into nationalist lunacy, it is 
	Nikhil who extends his love and support to her. To him, Miss Gilby is 
	another flesh-and-blood human being like himself, not just a European to be 
	perceived through a mist of abstraction, or an enemy of Bengal, simply 
	because she happens to be an English woman. The same applies to Panchu, a 
	downtrodden villager insulted and humiliated by the neighbouring <em>
	zamindar</em>, and evicted by him for not heeding the call of <em>swadeshi</em>, 
	who is saved by Nikhil’s humanitarian intervention and offer of protection.
	<em>Swadeshi</em> is supposed to liberate these people from the shackles of 
	British oppression but has somehow, ironically, become repressive of the 
	same defenceless mass. The Muslims are also looked upon with ire because 
	they refuse to share Sandip’s enthusiasm, which they see basically as a 
	Hindu agenda, counteractive to their cause. Thus, when Sandip engages in 
	wicked plots against them, to make them to submit to his purpose, 
	considering them as religious minorities not strong enough to withstand his 
	pressures, Nikhil steps in on their behalf knowing that as his subjects they 
	deserve his protection, and that, as individuals, they have the same right 
	to a choice as Sandip and his followers.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nikhil loves his country as much as, 
	if not more than, Sandip, but he will not allow his love for the country to 
	overtake his conscience. “I am willing,” he says, “to serve my country; but 
	my worship I reserve for Right which is far greater than my country. To 
	worship my country as god is to bring curse upon it” (29). Sandip, on the 
	other hand, believes that “country’s needs must be made into a god” (122), 
	and one ought to set “aside conscience [by] putting the country in its 
	place” (165). This reckless deification of the nation and his belief that 
	any action, no matter how heinous or unscrupulous, is justifiable if 
	undertaken for the nation’s sake, eventually turns him into a frightful 
	terrorist and appalling criminal. He does not mind using intrigue or 
	violence to accomplish his mission, even if it means harm to his own 
	followers. As long as the mission is accomplished, the end justifies his 
	means. Thus, when Bimala is innocently intoxicated by his nationalist call, 
	he adroitly persuades her to give all her jewellery to him to finance the 
	movement, and steal money belonging to Bara Rani (Bimala’s elder 
	sister-in-law and a widow who Nikhil loves as his own sister) from the 
	family safe. He also uses Amulya, an impassioned but idealistic youth 
	(emblematic of the many adolescents who were influenced by the movement), 
	exploitatively. When Mirjan, a Muslim boatman, refuses to stop carrying 
	foreign goods, as it will take away his livelihood, Sandip arranges to sink 
	his boat in midstream. Instead of showing any compunction for his hideous 
	deed, he advises his followers: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If they go to law, we must 
		retaliate by burning down their granaries! What startles you, Amulya?... 
		You must remember, this is war. If you are afraid of causing suffering, 
		go in for love-making, you will never do for this work! (113) </font>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Post-colonial critics such as Ernest 
	Gellner, Benedict Anderson and Tom Nairn have pointed out how nationalism 
	cultivates the sentiments of irrationality, prejudice and hatred in people, 
	and Leela Gandhi has spoken of its attendant racism and loathing, and the 
	alacrity with which citizens are willing to both kill and die for it. Frantz 
	Fanon has explained that although the objective of nationalism is to create 
	a horizontal relationship and fraternity within its people, in reality the 
	nation never speaks of the hopes and aspirations of the entire “imagined 
	community”, and hierarchy, factional hegemony, inequality and exploitation 
	remain a daily occurrence in its body. In Sandip’s actions, Tagore has 
	insightfully and shrewdly anticipated all these pitfalls of nationalism 
	pointed out by later literary-cultural critics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore is not perhaps entirely 
	historically accurate in his portrait of the <em>swaraj</em>. He has not, 
	for example, incorporated in his narrative the extreme policies of brutality 
	adopted by the Raj to crack the movement. Minto’s mischievous manifesto that 
	“the strong hand carries more respect in India than even the recognition of 
	British justice” led to widespread atrocities against the participants of 
	the movement; university students were “harassed, persecuted and oppressed”, 
	while those at lower levels were “flogged, fined and expelled.” Police were 
	advised to beat up marchers with their long, metal-tipped <em>lathis</em>, 
	and leaders who were found guilty were sentenced to “rigorous imprisonment”. 
	After the Khudiram incident, the British reaction was predictably strident, 
	declaring that “ten of them would be shot for every life sacrificed.” 
	However, although the writer has advertently left out this side of the 
	story, his portrait of Sandip seems typical of the activities of the New 
	Party, the revolutionary wing of Congress, under the leadership of Bipin 
	Chandra Pal, who led a group of radical youths and edited a popular journal 
	called <em>Bande Mataram</em>, and of Aurobindo Ghosh’s younger brother, 
	Barindra Kumar, who was the leader of a group of young terrorists who were 
	inspired by Russian anarchist activities and apotheosised violence. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was so deeply frustrated by
	<em>swadeshi</em> turning into a terrorist movement that he would spurn even 
	Gandhi’s <em>swaraj</em> in later years. He was not to participate in a 
	nationalist movement again because he came to believe that radical 
	nationalism, like religious orthodoxy, breeds divisiveness and blind 
	fanaticism: “Formalism in religion is like nationalism in politics: it 
	breeds sectarian arrogance, mutual misunderstanding and a spirit of 
	persecution”, he wrote in a letter to his friend C.F. Andrews. In another 
	letter, he explained how nationalism, a cult of devil worship, was 
	inherently destructive to the spirit of global unity and the creative bond 
	of wholeness: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The nations love their own 
		countries; and that national love has only given rise to hatred and 
		suspicion of one another…. When we hear “Bande Mataram” from the 
		house-tops, we shout to our neighbours: ‘You are not our brothers’…. 
		Whatever may be its use for the present, it is like the house being set 
		on fire simply for roasting the pig! Love of self, whether national or 
		individual, can have no other destination except suicide. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If asked about the future of India 
	under the colonial rule, Tagore’s unequivocal reply was, “Let us… set our 
	house in order. Do not mind the waves in the sea, but mind the leaks in your 
	vessel.” He believed in constructive social work and education as the 
	principle ways for liberating India from political and cultural tyranny from 
	within and outside, and not a blind revolution built upon the quicksand of 
	mob psychology. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This anti-nationalitarian sentiment, 
	conceived against a backdrop of a larger ideology of love, creation and 
	global human fellowship, is what occupies Tagore’s <em>The Home and the 
	World</em>. This is a message he pursues in several of his other works, 
	including his lectures on <em>Nationalism</em> and his novel <em>Four 
	Chapters</em>. It emphasizes the significance to the novel’s title: humanity 
	ought to overcome all thorny hedges of exclusion and readjust its moral 
	imagination. Love and fellowship, like commodities, do not have to stop at a 
	geographical border, and in spite of the ostensible spatial demarcation 
	between the home and the world, the two remain fundamentally united as 
	integral aspects of one organic whole. </font></p>
