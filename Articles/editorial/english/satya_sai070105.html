							<p class="description">For Immediate Release <br>
							<br>
							Former followers of India's supposed 'man of 
							miracles', Sathya Sai Baba, and others such as 
							Rationalists, Humanists, and still others 
							representing several religious backgrounds, and 
							none, allege sexual and human rights abuses and 
							various terrible crimes to have been committed by 
							India's most famous - and infamous - guru, whose 
							exchequer rates in the billions. Vast foreign 
							donations flow to him, a fact not despised by local, 
							state and central governments in India. <br>
							<br>
							BBC investigators saw that Sathya Sai Baba has been 
							profoundly protected by successive Indian 
							governments. In making 'The Secret Swami,' (2004), 
							the BBC felt compelled, given the cultish secrecy 
							and non-accountability of Sai Baba, his ashram 
							officials and worldwide organisation, to use a 
							hidden camera focused on world Chairman of Sai 
							Baba's organisation, Dr Michael Goldstein, who 
							seemed anything but spiritual in his angry 
							responses, and who failed to answer perfectly fair 
							questions. Top journalists from Times of London, 
							Daily Telegraph, the Age, The West Australian, 
							several Canadian and European newspapers and others 
							have found the highly secretive Sathya Sai Baba cult 
							very difficult to investigate. Canadian Broadcasting 
							Corporation, which thrice in July 2005 at major 
							viewing times showed ‘The Secret Swami’, resisted 
							the protest of hundreds of organised Sai Baba 
							devotee callers, stating that that it stood by the 
							professionalism of its BBC colleagues. Evidence from 
							media organisations suggests that other media who 
							might want to investigate can expect a 
							none-too-spiritual call from wealthy, high-profile 
							supporters, and to be threatened with litigation, 
							withdrawal of advertising, etc. <br>
							<br>
							Worldwide, the official Sathya Sai Organisation 
							attempts to make its founder and itself respectable 
							to mainstream political, religious and social 
							welfare organisations. They do not tell the public 
							about the marked integrity of many individuals and 
							families worldwide who accuse him of sexually 
							abusing boys and young men, of promising miraculous 
							cures that never happen, of distorting 
							well-established historical and scientific facts, of 
							making entirely contradictory claims across his 
							discourses and interviews, or of being implicated in 
							the killings in his bedroom on June 6, 1993, nor of 
							the massive cover-up that attended these and other 
							horrible crimes at the guru's ashram. His promoters 
							(though he says that he does not promote) typically 
							withhold the fact that they regard Sathya Sai Baba 
							as God fully incarnate, come to save the entire 
							world before his self-prophesied leaving of it in AD 
							2022. They do not reveal that some of his 
							much-vaunted 'miracles' have been exposed as fakes 
							(see video footage at:
							<a href="http://home.hetnet.nl/~comments_on/_the_secret_swami/_sai_baba2.htm">
							http://home.hetnet.nl/~comments_on/_the_secret_swami/_sai_baba2.htm</a>&nbsp; 
							) <br>
							<br>
							Sathya Sai Baba's critics comprise many age groups 
							up to people in their 70's. No matter their 
							excellent standing in their professions and wider 
							communities, one after another is relentlessly 
							defamed by a number of Sathya Sai Baba's followers, 
							sometimes by some of his key leaders. Those critics 
							who have resigned on a matter of high principle from 
							his organisation, some of whom were for years highly 
							respected by Sathya Sai Organisation leaders, are 
							now reviled and libeled, as though they had turned 
							overnight from angels into demons. In a public 
							discourse, Sai Baba derided his critics as being 
							bought, as Judases, and - strange for one 
							proclaiming himself to be the greatest of all 
							appearances of the Divine on earth - boastfully 
							compared the extent of his good works to those of 
							politicians, who he says have done one 
							ten-thousandths less than he has done. Critics say 
							that it is, in any case, his followers who perform 
							practically all these services! A comparison with 
							the content of pro-Sai Baba Internet apologist 
							contributions and those of academics, formerly 
							favourable to Sai Baba, like Robert Priddy and Brian 
							Steel, may suggest which group is speaking for 
							freedom, truth and conscience and which reveals 
							blind and sometimes fanatical apologetics on behalf 
							on one of history's most powerful cults. See - 
							http://home.no.net/anir/Sai/ and Brian Steel:
							<a href="http://bdsteel.tripod.com/More/">
							http://bdsteel.tripod.com/More/</a>&nbsp; There are 
							general, multilingual websites at: www.Exbaba.com 
							and <a href="http://www.Saiguru.net">www.Saiguru.net</a>&nbsp; 
							The well-supported pro Sai Baba antagonists are easy 
							to locate. <br>
							<br>
							I occasionally produce researched articles but am, 
							essentially, in the 'back room' with others around 
							the world devising/coordinating/operating, and have 
							been involved for over five years in many 
							international actions exposing Sai Baba and the 
							powerful organisation that covers up for him. Our 
							actions recur to media, government, United Nations, 
							law enforcement, building support for survivors of 
							SSB and his outfit, etc. You may see a little of my 
							activity at the following Urls: <br>
