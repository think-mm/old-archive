	Nepalese Protesters Dismiss King's Pledge Of Democracy </strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>By Justin Huggler
	</strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">22 April 2006<br>
	<strong>
	<a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article359438.ece">
	The Independent </a></strong></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
	<strong><font size="5">K</font></strong>ing Gyanendra of Nepal made a 
	desperate attempt to save his throne as hundreds of thousands of people took 
	to the streets of Kathmandu yesterday calling for his overthrow. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a televised address, the 
	King promised to restore democracy and hold elections, and revert to being a 
	constitutional monarch. But his words were dismissed by the opposition 
	parties which have been leading the protests as too little, too late. &quot;The 
	King has not clearly addressed the road map of the protest movement,&quot; said 
	Krishna Prasad Sitaula, spokesman for the largest opposition party, the 
	Nepali Congress. &quot;Our protest campaign will continue.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the streets too, the people 
	vowed to continue their rallies. There were spontaneous demonstrations in 
	reaction to the King's speech, with people chanting: &quot;Democracy is coming! 
	Gyanendra leave the country!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking tense before the 
	camera, King Gyanendra said: &quot;We are committed to multi-party democracy and 
	a constitutional monarchy. Executive power of the kingdom of Nepal, which 
	was in our safekeeping, shall from this day be returned to the people.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was speaking after the 
	biggest protests yet in Kathmandu, which saw protesters breach many of the 
	defences of the police and army and march deep into the city centre, which 
	is under strict curfew. They marched in a column that filled the wide avenue 
	and stretched for two miles. Local television news put the size of the crowd 
	at 150,000, but that seemed a severe underestimate.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Death to the monarchy!&quot; they 
	chanted as they marched. And as they walked, the people of Kathmandu lined 
	the streets to cheer them on. This was a nation on the march. Several police 
	lines fell back before them. Soldiers guarding the airport grinned and gave 
	them signs of support.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At times, the crowd had a 
	carnival atmosphere. They danced in the streets and shouted with joy that 
	they had defied the curfew. &quot;It is a tragedy for Nepal if Gyanendra lives,&quot; 
	they sang.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At one moment, the crowd 
	suddenly turned and headed for the city centre with a surge of purpose. 
	Several protesters shouted: &quot;To the palace!&quot; But they met more sustained 
	resistance from the army lines deeper inside the city, and several 
	protesters were injured after soldiers opened fire with rubber bullets.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was with these scenes raging 
	outside his palace that the King made his attemptto defuse the crisis. 
	Sitting in front of a backdrop similar to the one he appeared before when he 
	seized the absolute powers of a medieval king last year, he said he was 
	acting &quot;in the greater interest of the nation and the people, and our 
	unflinching commitment toward constitutional monarchy and multi-party 
	democracy&quot;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He called for talks with the 
	seven-party opposition alliance which has been leading the protests and 
	asked it to nominate one of its number to serve as interim prime minister 
	until elections could be held. Nepalese analysts said that was a clear 
	attempt to split the seven-party alliance, which have never agreed on 
	anything except their opposition to the King's rule.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The opposition parties said 
	their leader would meet today to discuss the King's proposals. But the 
	biggest parties were quick to dismiss them. &quot;We haven't been demonstrating 
	for the premiership,&quot; said one senior figure.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The people will not accept 
	this speech,&quot; said Chakra Sijapatki, a security guard at a hotel who was 
	listening to the speech on a car radio. &quot;We have been fighting for democracy 
	and a republic.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many on the streets complained 
	the King had said nothing about bringing the Maoist guerrillas who have been 
	fighting a 10-year civil war into the mainstream. The opposition parties 
	have agreed a frameworks for peace talks.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was positive reaction on 
	the streets. &quot;Now the King can become a ceremonial monarch,&quot; said one 
	protester, Utsav Koirala. King Gyanendra has offered elections before. What 
	people want is a new constituent assembly to debate whether Nepal should 
	have a monarchy at all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;How can the King remain? He 
	must take responsibility for all the people who have been killed in these 
	protests,&quot; said Prakash Dhidal, another protester. A protester who was 
	injured by police gunfire in Kathmandu on Thursday died of his injuries 
	yesterday, bringing the number killed in Kathmandu to four.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a huge swelling of 
	anger against the violence used by police on protesters. Doctors at the 
	hospital where the bodies were taken wore black armbands yesterday. On the 
	spot where the police fired on the demonstrators, some one wrote in chalk 
	&quot;Martyrs' Square&quot;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kantipur newspaper yesterday 
	printed the name of one police officer who it said shot an unarmed protester 
	in the head and killed him - which may well lead to reprisals against the 
	officer.</font></p>
