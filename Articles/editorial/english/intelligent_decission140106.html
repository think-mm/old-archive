      Dramatic evidence of ID's religious nature and aspirations is found in 
      what </span>is referred to as the &quot;Wedge Document.&quot; The Wedge Document, 
      developed by the Discovery Institute's Center for Renewal of Science and 
      Culture (hereinafter &quot;CRSC&quot;), represents from an institutional standpoint, 
      the IDM's [Intelligent Design Model] goals and objectives, much as 
      writings from the Institute for Creation Research did for the earlier 
      creation-science movement. The Wedge Document states in its &quot;Five Year 
      Strategic Plan Summary&quot; that the IDM's goal is to replace science as 
      currently practiced with &quot;theistic and Christian science.&quot;&nbsp; As posited in 
      the Wedge Document, the IDM's &quot;Governing Goals&quot; are to &quot;defeat scientific 
      materialism and its destructive moral, cultural, and political legacies&quot; 
      and &quot;to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding 
      that nature and human beings are created by God.&quot; The CSRC expressly 
      announces, in the Wedge Document, a program of Christian apologetics to 
      promote ID. A careful review of the Wedge Document's goals and language 
      throughout the document reveals cultural and religious goals, as opposed 
      to scientific ones. ID aspires to change the ground rules of science to 
      make room for religion, specifically, beliefs consonant with a particular 
      version of Christianity.&nbsp; In addition to the IDM itself describing ID as a 
      religious argument, ID's religious nature is evident because it involves a 
      supernatural designer...Prominent ID proponents have made abundantly clear 
      that the designer is supernatural.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">
      Defendants' expert witness ID proponents confirmed that the existence of a 
      supernatural designer is a hallmark of ID. First, Professor Behe has 
      written that by ID he means &quot;not designed by the laws of nature,&quot; and that 
      it is &quot;implausible that the designer is a natural entity.&quot; Second, 
      Professor Minnich testified that for ID to be considered science, the 
      ground rules of science have to be broadened so that supernatural forces 
      can be considered.&nbsp; Third, Professor Steven William Fuller testified that 
      it is ID's project to change the ground rules of science to include the 
      supernatural.</span></font></p>

      notable that not one defense expert was able to explain how the 
      supernatural action suggested by ID could be anything other than an 
      inherently religious proposition. Accordingly, we find that ID's religious 
      nature would be further evident to our objective observer because it 
      directly involves a supernatural designer.</span></font></p>

      <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of Pandas and People</font></h3>
      </span><span style="font-family: times">
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">The 
      evidence at trial demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of 
      creationism. What is likely the strongest evidence supporting the finding 
      of ID's creationist nature is the history and historical pedigree of the 
      book to which students in Dover's ninth grade biology class are referred, 
      Pandas [<i>Of Pandas and People</i>]. Pandas is published by an 
      organization called FTE, as noted, whose articles of incorporation and 
      filings with the Internal Revenue Service describe it as a religious, 
      Christian organization.&nbsp; Pandas was written by Dean Kenyon and Percival 
      Davis, both acknowledged creationists, and Nancy Pearcey, a Young Earth 
      Creationist, contributed to the work. As Plaintiffs meticulously and 
      effectively presented to the Court, Pandas went through many drafts, 
      several of which were completed prior to and some after the Supreme 
      Court's decision in Edwards, which held that the Constitution forbids 
      teaching creationism as science. By comparing the pre and post Edwards 
      drafts of Pandas, three astonishing points emerge: (1) the definition for 
      creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID; (2) 
      cognates of the word creation (creationism and creationist), which 
      appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically 
      replaced with the phrase ID; and (3) the changes occurred shortly after 
      the Supreme Court held that creation science is religious and cannot be 
      taught in public school science classes in Edwards. This word substitution 
      is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of <i>words</i> 
      was effected without any corresponding change in <i>content</i>, which 
      directly refutes FTE's argument that by merely disregarding the words 
      &quot;creation&quot; and &quot;creationism,&quot; FTE expressly rejected creationism in 
      Pandas. In early pre- Edwards drafts of Pandas, the term &quot;creation&quot; was 
      defined as &quot;various forms of life that began abruptly through an 
      intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact – fish with fins 
      and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc,&quot; the very same way 
      in which ID is defined in the subsequent published version.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"></span><font face="Verdana">
      <span style="font-family: times; color: black">The weight of the evidence 
      clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from &quot;creation&quot; 
      to &quot;intelligent design&quot; occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme 
      Court's important Edwards decision. This compelling evidence strongly 
      supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled. 
      Importantly, the objective observer, whether adult or child, would 
      conclude from the fact that Pandas posits a master intellect that the 
      intelligent designer is God. Further evidence in support of the conclusion 
      that a reasonable observer, adult or child, who is &quot;aware of the history 
      and context of the community and forum&quot; is presumed to know that ID is a 
      form of creationism concerns the fact that ID uses the same, or 
      exceedingly similar arguments as were posited in support of creationism. 
      One significant difference is that the words &quot;God,&quot; &quot;creationism,&quot; and 
      &quot;Genesis&quot; have been systematically purged from ID explanations, and 
      replaced by an unnamed &quot;designer.&quot; …The sole argument Defendants made to 
      distinguish creationism from ID was their assertion that the term 
      &quot;creationism&quot; applies only to arguments based on the Book of Genesis, a 
      young earth, and a catastrophic Noaich flood; however, substantial 
      evidence established that this is only one form of creationism. </span>

      <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Definition of science</font></h3>
      </span><span style="font-family: times">
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After a searching review of the 
      record and applicable caselaw, we find that while ID arguments may be 
      true, a proposition on which the Court takes no position, ID is not 
      science. We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which 
      is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are: 
      (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and 
      permitting supernatural causation; (2) the argument of irreducible 
      complexity, central to ID, employs the same flawed and illogical contrived 
      dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980's; and (3) ID's negative 
      attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community. It is 
      additionally important to note that ID has failed to gain acceptance in 
      the scientific community, it has not generated peer-reviewed publications, 
      nor has it been the subject of testing and research.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Expert testimony reveals that 
      since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science 
      has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural 
      phenomena. This revolution entailed the rejection of the appeal to 
      authority, and by extension, revelation, in favor of empirical evidence. 
      Since that time period, science has been a discipline in which 
      testability, rather than any ecclesiastical authority or philosophical 
      coherence, has been the measure of a scientific idea's worth. In 
      deliberately omitting theological or &quot;ultimate&quot; explanations for the 
      existence or characteristics of the natural world, science does not 
      consider issues of &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot; in the world.&nbsp; While 
      supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not 
      part of science.&nbsp; This self-imposed convention of science, which limits 
      inquiry to testable, natural explanations about the natural world, is 
      referred to by philosophers as &quot;methodological naturalism&quot; and is 
      sometimes known as the scientific method. Methodological naturalism is a 
      &quot;ground rule&quot; of science today which requires scientists to seek 
      explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, 
      replicate, and verify. </font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">ID 
      takes a natural phenomenon and, instead of accepting or seeking a natural 
      explanation, argues that the explanation is supernatural. </span>It is 
      notable that defense experts' own mission, which mirrors that of the IDM 
      itself, is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural 
      causation of the natural world…Defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that 
      ID aspires to &quot;change the ground rules&quot; of science and lead defense expert 
      Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which 
      encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. Moreover, defense expert 
      Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the 
      ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of 
      supernatural forces.</font></p>

      cultural confrontation and renewal.&nbsp; In the &quot;Five Year Strategic Plan 
      Summary,&quot; the Wedge Document explains that the social consequences of 
      materialism have been &quot;devastating&quot; and that it is necessary to broaden 
      the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic 
      scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of ID. &quot;Design 
      theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist 
      worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and 
      theistic convictions.&quot; Phase I of the Wedge Strategy is an essential 
      component and directly references &quot;scientific revolutions.&quot; Phase II 
      explains that alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, &quot;we also 
      seek to build up a popular base of support among our natural constituency, 
      namely, Christians. We will do this primarily through apologetics 
      seminars. We intend these to encourage and equip believers with new 
      scientific evidence that support the faith, as well as to 'popularize' our 
      ideas in the broader culture.&quot;&nbsp; Finally, Phase III includes pursuing 
      possible legal assistance &quot;in response to resistance to the integration of 
      design theory into public school science curricula.&quot;…The Wedge Document 
      states in its &quot;Five Year Strategic Plan Summary&quot; that the IDM's goal is to 
      replace science as currently practiced with &quot;theistic andChristian 
      science.&quot;&nbsp; The IDM accordingly seeks nothing less than a complete 
      scientific revolution in which ID will supplant evolutionary theory.</span></font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not a single expert witness over 
      the course of the six week trial identified one major scientific 
      association, society or organization that endorsed ID as science. What is 
      more, defense experts concede that ID is not a theory as that term is 
      defined by the NAS and admit that ID is at best &quot;fringe science&quot; which has 
      achieved no acceptance in the scientific community. </font></p>

      <h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No Evidence For ID</font></h3>
      </span><span style="font-family: times">
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">A final 
      indicator of how ID has failed to demonstrate scientific warrant is the 
      complete absence of peer-reviewed publications supporting the theory…The 
      evidence presented in this case demonstrates that ID is not supported by 
      any peer-reviewed research, data or publications…The one article 
      referenced by both Professors Behe and Minnich as supporting ID is an 
      article written by Behe and Snoke entitled &quot;Simulating evolution by gene 
      duplication of protein features that require multiple amino acid 
      residues.&quot; A review of the article indicates that it does not mention 
      either irreducible complexity or ID. In fact, Professor Behe admitted that 
      the study which forms the basis for the article did not rule out many 
      known evolutionary mechanisms and that the research actually might support 
      evolutionary pathways if a biologically realistic population size were 
      used…On cross-examination, Professor Behe admitted that: &quot;There are no 
      peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design 
      supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed 
      rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system 
      occurred.&quot; </span></font></p>

      <p align="justify"></span><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">
      <span style="font-family: times">Additionally, Professor Behe conceded 
      that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex 
      molecular systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting 
      cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed.&nbsp; In that 
      regard, there are no peer-reviewed articles supporting Professor Behe's 
      argument that certain complex molecular structures are &quot;irreducibly 
      complex.&quot;&nbsp; In addition to failing to produce papers in peer-reviewed 
      journals, ID also features no scientific research or testing.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: times">

      <font size="5" face="Verdana">JUDGE'S CONCLUSIONS</font></span></h4>
      </span><span style="font-family: times">
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">After 
      this searching and careful review of ID as espoused by its proponents, as 
      elaborated upon in submissions to the Court, and as scrutinized over a six 
      week trial, we find that ID is not science and cannot be adjudged a valid, 
      accepted scientific theory as it has failed to publish in peer-reviewed 
      journals, engage in research and testing, and gain acceptance in the 
      scientific community. ID, as noted, is grounded in theology, not science. 
      Accepting for the sake of argument its proponents', as well as Defendants' 
      argument that to introduce ID to students will encourage critical 
      thinking, it still has utterly no place in a science curriculum.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">
      Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which 
      we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the <i>
      controversy</i>, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. 
      This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of 
      the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution 
      which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID. To conclude and 
      reiterate, we express no opinion on the ultimate veracity of ID as a 
      supernatural explanation. However, we commend to the attention of those 
      who are inclined to superficially consider ID to be a true &quot;scientific&quot; 
      alternative to evolution without a true understanding of the concept the 
      foregoing detailed analysis. It is our view that a reasonable, objective 
      observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, 
      and our narrative, reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an 
      interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">Both 
      Defendants and many of the leading proponents of ID make a bedrock 
      assumption which is utterly false. Their presupposition is that 
      evolutionary theory is antithetical to a belief in the existence of a 
      supreme being and to religion in general. Repeatedly in this trial, 
      Plaintiffs' scientific experts testified that the theory of evolution 
      represents good science, is overwhelmingly accepted by the scientific 
      community, and that it in no way conflicts with, nor does it deny, the 
      existence of a divine creator.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">To be 
      sure, Darwin's theory of evolution is imperfect. However, the fact that a 
      scientific theory cannot yet render an explanation on every point should 
      not be used as a pretext to thrust an untestable alternative hypothesis 
      grounded in religion into the science classroom or to misrepresent 
      well-established scientific propositions.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">The 
      citizens of the Dover area were poorly served by the members of the Board 
      who voted for the ID Policy. It is ironic that several of these 
      individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious 
      convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and 
      disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">With 
      that said, we do not question that many of the leading advocates of ID 
      have bona fide and deeply held beliefs which drive their scholarly 
      endeavors. Nor do we controvert that ID should continue to be studied, 
      debated, and discussed. As stated, our conclusion today is that it is 
      unconstitutional to teach ID as an alternative to evolution in a public 
      school science classroom.</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black">Those 
      who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an 
      activist judge. If so, they will have erred as this is manifestly not an 
      activist Court.&nbsp; Rather, this case came to us as the result of the 
      activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board, aided by a national 
      public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID, 
      who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately 
      unconstitutional policy. The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision 
      is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been 
      fully revealed through this trial. The students, parents, and teachers of 
      the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into 
      this legal maelstrom, with its resulting utter waste of monetary and 
      personal resources.</span></font></p>

      preserve the separation of church and state mandated by the Establishment 
      Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Art. 
      I, § 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, we will enter an order 
      permanently enjoining Defendants from maintaining the ID Policy in any 
      school within the Dover Area School District, from requiring teachers to 
      denigrate or disparage the scientific theory of evolution, and from 
      requiring teachers to refer to a religious, alternative theory known as 
      ID. We will also issue a declaratory judgment that Plaintiffs' rights 
      under the Constitutions of the United States and the Commonwealth of

      actions in violation of Plaintiffs' civil rights as guaranteed to them by 
      the Constitution of the United States and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 subject 
      Defendants to liability with respect to injunctive and declaratory relief,
