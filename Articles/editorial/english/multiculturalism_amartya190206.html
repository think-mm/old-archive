		There is something about dining at an Oxbridge high table which makes 
		conversation seem a little inadequate. Perhaps it is the surroundings. 
		We are seated at the top of a magnificent dining hall in Trinity 
		College, Cambridge , from which academics preside over hundreds of 
		undergraduates as they eat their lunch. But Amartya Sen suggests that we 
		should be sociable. Besides, he has some old colleagues to catch up 
		with.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Sen has graciously invited me to dine at his alma mater - he used to be 
		the master at Trinity, and remains a fellow, but left two years ago to 
		take up a professorship at Harvard - before our interview. He can afford 
		to relax at high table, because for him there are no academic heights 
		left to scale. At 72, Sen features regularly and highly on polls of the 
		world's most famous public intellectuals. Within his chosen discipline 
		of economics, he is chiefly known for his work on economics of equality, 
		poverty and famine. In 1998, he collected the Nobel Prize for Economics 
		for his work on social choice theory, an abstract, rather unworldly 
		version of political economy which tries to make sense of how to 
		aggregate our individual preferences into a workable social whole.
		</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Although he disagrees with some of the more audacious assumptions of 
		social choice theory - for most social theorists, the individual 
		utility-maximiser who makes an appearance in social choice theory looks 
		a little dessicated and mechanical - its starting-point of what it is to 
		be a person capable of making choices has helped motivate Sen's core 
		intellectual concern with reason and individual freedom. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		After lunch, over coffee in the Fellows' Room, he tells me about his 
		latest project. For some years now, Sen's concerns have outgrown those 
		of economics to dwell on questions of democracy and culture. In the 
		light of the recent furores over Islam and multiculturalism, Sen has 
		written a new book, Identity and Violence, to be published in this 
		country in July, which will take a trenchantly critical look at the 
		British interpretation of multiculturalism. Sen sees it as his mission 
		is to rescue what he sees as valuable in the idea of multiculturalism 
		from the prevailing British idea of &quot;plural monoculturalism&quot;, which he 
		takes to be damaging and divisive. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		What grates on Sen is the idea that individuals should be ushered like 
		sheep into pens according to their religious faith, a mode of 
		classification that too often trumps all others and ignores the fact 
		that people are always complex, multi-faceted individuals who choose 
		their identities from a wide range of economic, cultural and ideological 
		alternatives. &quot;Being defined by one group identity over all others,&quot; he 
		says, &quot;overlooking whether you're working class or capitalist, left or 
		right, what your language group is and your literary tastes are, all 
		that interferes with people's freedom to make their own choices.&quot; </font>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		What begins by giving people room to express themselves, he argues, may 
		force people into an identity chosen by the authorities. &quot;That is what 
		is happening now, here,&quot; he says, a little indignantly. &quot;I think there 
		is a real tyranny there. It doesn't look like tyranny - it looks like 
		giving freedom and tolerance - but it ends up being a denial of 
		individual freedom. The individual belongs to many different groups and 
		it is up to him or her to decide which of those groups he or she would 
		like to give priority.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Sen is also critical of the growing consultative power given to the 
		religious organisations of Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. It does, he 
		believes, magnify the power and authority of religious leaders at the 
		expense of a healthy democratic debate. &quot;Suddenly the Jewish, Hindu and 
		Muslim organisations are in charge of all Jews, Hindus and Muslims. 
		Whether you are an extremist mullah or a moderate mullah, whether you're 
		Blair's friend or Blair's enemy, you might relish the idea of being able 
		to speak for all people with a Muslim background - no matter how 
		religious they are - but this may be in direct competition with the role 
		of Muslims in British civil society.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		When it comes to a deeply political problem such as terrorism, for the 
		authorities to advise &quot;action within the community&quot; is, he believes, a 
		great mistake. Sen was in London on the day of the July 7 bombings, and 
		heard the ensuing appeals on the part of the authorities for &quot;the Muslim 
		community&quot; to get its act together. &quot;That was an attempt to bring even 
		more religion into politics, which is not needed,&quot; he says. &quot;To classify 
		Bangladeshis, for example, only as Muslims and overlook their 
		Bangladeshi identity is seriously misleading. To drown all that into a 
		vision of 'you are just a Muslim - please be moderate and likeable and 
		replace all those extremist imams with moderate and likeable ones', that 
		is simply wrong-headed.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Sen has good reason to fear religious sectarianism. Seared into his 
		political consciousness is the memory of how India suddenly fragmented 
		into a soup of religious identities in the period before partition, when 
		people began increasingly to define themselves as Hindus, Muslims and 
		Sikhs. &quot;This is the way,&quot; he says, &quot;that the British tried to interpret 
		community divisions in India between Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and 
		Christians. To Indian nationalists, it looked a further example of 
		divide and rule, emphasising the divisions. The way that the British are 
		handling it today makes one wonder whether the cultural confusion that 
		the British had then has now been brought back home.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		The government's policy of promoting faith schools is a mistake, Sen 
		believes. &quot;To put people in a faith school is to pre-classify people 
		into categories at a time when they can't even think for themselves. 
		They are told that they have a very clear identity, which swamps all 
		other identities. They are Muslims or Sikhs or Hindus and that is all 
		you are going to get. Now of course, later on, they might be able to 
		overcome that narrowness, but it is much harder to overcome if it has 
		been drilled into you that that is what you are.&quot; It is not that he is 
		hostile to religion, he says; it is simply a question of context. Gandhi 
		was very much a religious man and a religious Hindu, he reminds me, but 
		when it came to politics he was thoroughly secular. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		But what about Sen himself? If ever there was a uniquely fluid identity, 
		it is him. Nowadays, he divides his time between Cambridge, Harvard, 
		India and Italy. He remains an Indian citizen, even though he has lived 
		half his life in Britain . He votes in British elections as a 
		Commonwealth citizen and, he tells me, takes his participation in those 
		elections just as seriously as he takes his participation in Indian 
		elections.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">In 
		an anecdote in the new book, Sen tells of backing Pakistan against India 
		in a series of one-day cricket matches in 2004 - they were losing, and 
		he wanted to keep the game interesting. &quot;But then they kept winning,&quot; he 
		says, with his mischievous schoolboy giggle, &quot;which I thought was a 
		little extreme.&quot; So you'd happily fail Norman Tebbit's famous cricket 
		test for determining British nationality? &quot;I'm not sure how much into 
		cricket Lord Tebbit is,&quot; he says, with a mixture of irritation and 
		amusement. &quot;If you were into cricket, then you would realise that who 
		you are cheering for will depend on your location, your regional 
		loyalty, and also on the nature of the game, where you are in the series 
		and who is playing, how well, and whose playing you would like to see 
		... In my case,&quot; he adds,&quot; primarily on television.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Before I leave, Sen wants to show me around Trinity's beautiful Wren 
		library. He greets the librarian as an old friend, and excitedly shows 
		me the first edition of Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica, with 
		Newton's finicky little handwriting. He points to the table where he 
		used to work when he arrived at Trinity 53 years ago. Surely Britain, I 
		suggest, is his spiritual home as much as anywhere? &quot;Yes ... so the 
		British identity issue is not a difficult one,&quot; he laughs.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Do 
		you see yourself as a cosmopolitan? Sen doesn't like the word, and 
		prefers to think of himself as having a global and multi-layered 
		identity. &quot;From the point of view of nationality I have an Indian 
		identity. But everyone has lots of identities, depending on the context. 
		I like teaching in Harvard and I have an identity as an American 
		academic. But I also have a strong identity as an economist, as left-of 
		centre, as an egalitarian.&quot; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		From the library, Sen takes me in his car to the other end of Trinity 
		College where we're due to meet the photographer. Standing waiting, he 
		looks thin and immaculately dressed, both stately and graceful. But it 
		is a crisp and cold afternoon, and Sen's patience with being a 
		photographer's model soon wears thin. &quot;A background in the Indo-Ganetic 
		plains doesn't prepare you for this,&quot; he complains. The climate might 
		not be ideal, but Sen left the Indian plains a long time ago, and he 
		seems to be doing rather well. </font></p>
