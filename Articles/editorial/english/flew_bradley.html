	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Antony: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I understand that you, one of the 
	icons of twentieth century atheism and one of my fellow Honorary Associates 
	of the NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists, now believe in some 
	sort of God. I am troubled. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not because you have given comfort 
	to religionists of all stripes, including biblical creationists, many of 
	whom now trumpet your name. Let comfort go to those who crave it. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nor because I think less of you for 
	changing your mind. On the contrary, I admire someone who has the 
	intellectual and moral courage to follow the evidence and the arguments 
	where they lead. Intransigence is no more virtuous in a nonbeliever than in 
	a believer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My disquiet stems, rather, from the 
	fact that, despite having read your disclosures with great care, I am still 
	at a loss to understand what sort of God you now embrace, or why. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The general outlines of your new 
	position are fairly clear. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the one hand, you have been 
	persuaded by some of the stuff you've recently read that naturalistic 
	explanations of apparent design in the universe just aren't credible. In 
	particular, you now subscribe to the idea that there are unbridgeable gaps 
	in evolutionary history, gaps such as those alleged to exist between 
	nonliving and living matter. And since, on your view, it is &quot;inordinately 
	difficult&quot; to give a naturalistic explanation of the origins of living 
	organisms, you conclude that only some nonnaturalistic explanation will 
	suffice, i.e., that only the intervention of some sort of supernatural 
	agent, to be called &quot;God,&quot; can fill these gaps. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, you are averse to 
	the idea that the explanatory agent is to be identified with any of the 
	standard theistic gods, the God of Judaism, the God of Christianity, or the 
	God of Islam. You want a God of natural theology, not of revealed religion.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So far, so good. But thereafter, 
	everything is murky. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's start with your conclusion. 
	You say that you have abandoned Atheism for belief in God. But the God of 
	which religion? Pantheism? Deism? Or of some non-Mosaic version of Theism?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You seem to have endorsed all three 
	of them, notwithstanding that belief in any one is logically inconsistent 
	with belief in any of the others, and that both Pantheism and Deism are 
	inconsistent with the alleged &quot;evidence&quot; you count on to support them.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Take Pantheism for a start. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In your letter to Roy Varghese 
	(about his book The Wonder of the World: a Journey from Modern Science to 
	the Mind of God, you claim that design arguments can be seen as &quot;arguments 
	for the existence of a Spinozistic ... 'God of Nature.'&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here, I submit, your thinking is 
	seriously muddled. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Spinoza's &quot;God&quot; isn't some entity 
	apart from nature, an entity that plans or designs nature, let alone one 
	that intervenes in nature to bring about such phenomena as life. On the 
	contrary, Spinoza's &quot;God&quot; just is nature (i.e., is identical with nature). 
	And so, by the way, is the &quot;God&quot; of Einstein, despite the fact that 
	Christianity Today cites you as thinking that Einstein believed in &quot;an 
	Intelligence that produced the integrative complexity of creation.&quot; The fact 
	is that Einstein did not believe in any such nonnatural, otherworldly &quot;God.&quot; 
	Neither does that other modern-day pantheistic physicist, Stephen Hawking. 
	As Hawking himself has explained, for him the term &quot;God&quot; means nothing more 
	than &quot;the embodiment of the laws of the universe.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no room, on any pantheist 
	view, for another God over and above nature, let alone for a supernatural 
	&quot;Intelligence&quot; that first plans, then executes, his designs for the 
	universe. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pantheism is nothing but atheism 
	accompanied by feelings of awe about the power and beauty of the cosmos 
	itself. If that were your &quot;new&quot; position, you wouldn't really have changed 
	positions at all. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's, then, set aside any talk of 
	Spinoza's God and turn to the God of Deism. Could this be the sort of God 
	you now believe in? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Early in your interview with Gary 
	Habermas, you agree that &quot;Deism&quot; would be a &quot;fair designation&quot; of your 
	current view. Moreover, in your letter to Richard Carrier, dated 16 October 
	2004, you claim to have in mind only &quot;the non-interfering God of the people 
	called Deists--such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.&quot; And more 
	recently still, Christianity Today (in its website article &quot;Thinking 
	Straighter,&quot; posted 8 March 2005) reports that you have said, &quot;I have become 
	a deist like Thomas Jefferson.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But surely you can't be serious. Not 
	only is the deistic hypothesis not supported by the new arguments for 
	Intelligent Design. It is logically inconsistent with those arguments.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Deism, remember, holds that God 
	leaves nature entirely to its own devices, i.e., to operate according to the 
	laws of nature with which he endowed it in the first place. The deist 
	conceives of his God as being competent enough to have got his design right 
	at the outset. His God has no need thereafter to intervene by making 
	adjustments or lending those laws a helping hand. A deist, therefore, will 
	reject the idea that natural mechanisms fail when it comes to the task of 
	producing the first living organisms or any of their more complex 
	descendants. The deist says the laws of nature suffice. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But you, apparently, think they 
	don't. If they did, then naturalistic explanations would still be possible. 
	You think that interventions of the kind that you, following Hume, have 
	hitherto called &quot;miracles,&quot; are needed. In fact you tell Roy Varghese that 
	there is room for two design arguments for an intervenor: the first from 
	&quot;the first emergence of living from non-living matter,&quot; the second from &quot;the 
	capacity [of that first living matter] to reproduce itself genetically.&quot; 
	Your idea of an intervening, miracle-working God is clearly inconsistent 
	with the deist's concept of a nonintervening one. Hence the designer you 
	postulate cannot, for logical reasons, be anything like the God of Deism.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Perhaps it is because of a vague 
	sense of this inconsistency that you have recently announced your reversion 
	to something like the Theism of your childhood. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In your interview with Gary Habermas 
	(published in the winter 2005 issue of Philosophia Christi under the title 
	&quot;My Pilgrimage from Atheism to Theism&quot;) you pass fairly quickly from an 
	acceptance of &quot;Deism&quot; as a description of your latest belief system to 
	acquiescence when Habermas talks about &quot;your theism&quot; as the form that &quot;your 
	new belief in God&quot; has now taken. Maybe you haven't yet reverted to the 
	Methodist Christianity of your first fourteen years. But you have come 
	close. Why else would you give such credence to Gerald Schroeder's The 
	Hidden Face of God whose comments on Genesis Chapter One reportedly suggest 
	to you that, as you put it, &quot;this biblical account might be scientifically 
	accurate&quot;? Why else would you say that Schroeder's analysis &quot;raises the 
	possibility that it [Genesis] is revelation&quot;? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Your acceptance of the possibility 
	of revelation in the book of Genesis takes you a long way from the austere 
	arguments of natural theology on which alone you wanted to rely. It lends 
	support to so-called &quot;Scientific Creationists.&quot; Not just the old-earth 
	creationists who put a figurative spin on the Genesis story, but the young 
	earth literalists, too: those who stick with something like 4,004 B.C. for 
	the year of the creation. After all, if your newfound God is a 
	miracle-worker, one can't rule out the possibility that he created the 
	universe just when Genesis says he did, complete with all the evidence that 
	leads scientists to think otherwise, including fossils, background radiation 
	from the Big Bang, and all the other necessary accoutrements of grand 
	deception. If your God performs miracles to help the laws of nature produce 
	living from nonliving things, why should he stop there? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I said earlier, your renunciation 
	of atheism has given comfort to religionists of all stripes. It is easy to 
	see why some of my fundamentalist/evangelical relatives and friends are 
	among them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let me ask about your reasons 
	for believing in God. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You say you like to follow the 
	evidence. An admirable sentiment. But what is the evidence on which you 
	rely? Is it really good evidence, evidence sturdy enough to bear the 
	superstructure of theistic inferences that you build upon it? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When it comes to scientific matters, 
	you and I (as philosophers) have to rely on secondhand reports, on what 
	expert scientists themselves say about matters in their areas of expertise. 
	So who did you select as your authorities to tell you about biological 
	matters, and the all-important question of what plausible theories might be 
	offered as to how life began and has subsequently evolved? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not biologists, or biochemists or 
	anyone working in the relevant fields of molecular biology and genetics. No. 
	You chose a couple of nonexperts, one of whom, Gerald Schroeder, is an 
	Israeli physicist and Orthodox Jew whose The Hidden Face of God (Touchstone, 
	New York; 2001) demonstrates minimal understanding of biological matters, 
	while the other, Roy Varghese, is a Protestant Christian, now engaged in the 
	lucrative &quot;mind of God&quot; industry with his book The Wonderful World: A 
	Journey from Modern Science to the Mind of God (Fountain Hills, Arizona; Tyr 
	Publishing 2003). It is upon them that you seemingly rely for your assertion 
	(in the August-September 2004 issue of Philosophy Now) that &quot;It has become 
	inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a 
	naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism.&quot; 
	And it is upon them that you seemingly rely for the claim (made in the new 
	video Has Science Discovered God?) that biologists' investigation of DNA 
	&quot;has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which 
	are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was a bit surprised that you 
	didn't invoke the names of William Demski, Michael Behe, or Philip Johnson, 
	all of whom feature rather more-prominently among the high priests of 
	Intelligent Design theory. Their arguments run along similar lines. So 
	perhaps you'll treat us to their versions in the near future. But before you 
	do so, please, please, acquaint yourself with some of the devastating 
	critiques to which this whole Intelligent Design movement has been subjected 
	over the past decade and more, not just by &quot;atheistic evolutionists&quot; but 
	also by experts with no doctrinal axes to grind. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's get back to the matter of the 
	evidence you claim to have followed. Is it positive evidence of God's 
	intervention to produce life? If it were, scientists would be agog and 
	religionists would be cheering so profound a discovery. But it isn't 
	positive evidence. Indeed, it is a bit of a cheat to call it &quot;evidence&quot; at 
	all. Rather it is unwarranted inference from a lack of evidence! One starts 
	with an alleged absence of evidence for naturalistic mechanisms that could 
	be causes of the origins of biological life and then infers from this that 
	one has evidence of the absence of such naturalistic mechanisms. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But this inference can be faulted on 
	two counts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, it is just plain false that 
	we are still ignorant, as Intelligent Design proponents would have us 
	believe, of the kinds of natural mechanisms that might bring about the 
	origins of life. Certainly, we once were. But molecular biologists are 
	working at banishing such ignorance. And are succeeding. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a salutary example, consider 
	Michael Behe's claim (in his 1996 book Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical 
	Challenge to Evolution) that no Darwinian explanation could be found in the 
	literature for the production of the nucleotide AMP or for the origins of 
	the human immune system. Only two years later, as David Ussery pointed out 
	(in his review of Behe's book), Behe's claim had been proven false. By 1998 
	&quot;literally thousands of articles had been published about the details of 
	molecular evolution.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only is Behe's premise false; 
	the inference he draws from it is fallacious. Ussery puts it this way:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is important to bring up these 
	examples, because this shows a real weakness in the logic that says, &quot;We 
	don't know how this happened, so God must have done it!&quot; What happens when 
	someone calls your bluff and actually DOES provide a step-by-step mechanism 
	for the gradual evolution of the immune system? As you know, we philosophers 
	have a name for the general fallacy to which Ussery is calling attention. It 
	is the called the Argument from Ignorance. In this particular instance, it 
	takes the form of what has been called the &quot;God of the Gaps Fallacy&quot;: the 
	fallacy that has led people down the ages, and still leads some today, to 
	invoke a supernatural cause whenever the natural causes of a phenomenon have 
	not yet been discovered. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only the scientifically illiterate 
	these days suppose that God's intervention is needed to keep most of the 
	natural world working. Yet some educated people still think that the 
	biological world is an exception and that it alone is in need of God's 
	tinkering. They wouldn't countenance the idea that God intervenes to bring 
	about natural phenomena like disease, earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes. 
	But they persist in believing, usually on the basis of some ancient 
	religious text, that he must have intervened to bring about the origins of 
	life and the subsequent phenomenon of speciation. You appear to have allied 
	yourself with them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But anyone who, like you, wants to 
	follow the evidence where it leads must be willing to go all the way, not 
	just stop at some agreeably comforting point. You think that following the 
	evidence takes you from evidence of complexity in the natural world to the 
	hypothesis of an intelligent designer of that world: not just one who comes 
	up with an original design, but one who also has to redesign that world from 
	time to time. But why stop there? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reflect carefully on the details of 
	that complexity. It is a complexity that is reflected in all aspects of the 
	natural world, not just the benign ones that true believers find reassuring, 
	but the more abhorrent and discomforting ones as well. Think of disease and 
	disaster, and the whole gruesome arsenal of God's weapons of mass 
	destruction: radiological, geophysical, meteorological, chemical, 
	biological, and the rest. Philosophers of religion tend to distance 
	themselves from them by sweeping them all together under the abstract term 
	&quot;natural evil.&quot; But think of each in concrete terms, and the enormity of the 
	problem becomes clear. As usual, the devil lies in the details. If 
	complexity manifests intelligence, then by the same token the &quot;god-awful&quot; 
	nature of much of that complexity manifests defective or malevolent 
	intelligence: the sort of intelligence that theists lay at the door of the 
	Devil himself (supposedly another of God's creations). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So my questions to you, dear Antony, 
	remain: What sort of &quot;God&quot; do you really believe in? And why? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Forty-five years ago, you wrote me a 
	letter applauding my &quot;necessary and valuable&quot; critique of claims that had 
	been made by certain distinguished physicists (Bohr and Heisenberg among 
	them) about the supposed implications of quantum mechanics. You agreed with 
	my criticisms and undertook, as a consequence, to rewrite several pages of a 
	book you were preparing for publication. And you lamented the fact that 
	because of your &quot;almost complete scientific ignorance&quot; you previously had 
	&quot;never dared even to touch on the subject in print.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Would that you had retained that 
	caution. A little more knowledge of organic chemistry and molecular biology 
	might have made you less credulous about the claims of the Intelligent 
	Design theorists. A little more critical acumen might have made you more 
	skeptical of the alleged theological implications of those claims. And a 
	little more thought about the baneful aspects of the universe might have 
	made you more resistant to belief in a God who built them into his design or 
	introduced them along the way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In short, had you researched and 
	reasoned more carefully you might not have made yourself the target of my 
	current critique. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Wittingly, or unwittingly, you have 
	achieved international celebrity status, yet I'm not sure what your latest 
	position is. I've heard that you may already have retreated from the 
	indeterminate theism of the Habermas interview to something like the deism 
	of Jefferson. But if that is the case, then you'll have to retreat also from 
	recent claims about the inadequacy of naturalistic explanations of the 
	origins of life and revert to something like Paley's older arguments for 
	initial design (not subsequent adjustments of that design). Perhaps, in 
	light of my arguments, you will change your mind once again and revert to 
	the well-reasoned atheism for which you once were renowned. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the meantime, your public, and 
	much publicized, embrace of &quot;God&quot; invites this public response. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I look forward to hearing what you 
	have to say for yourself by way of reply. </font></p>
