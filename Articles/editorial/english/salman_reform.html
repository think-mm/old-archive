				<NITF>When Sir Iqbal Sacranie, head of the Muslim Council of 
				Britain, admitted that &quot;our own children&quot; had perpetrated the 
				July 7 London bombings, it was the first time in my memory that 
				a British Muslim had accepted his community's responsibility for 
				outrages committed by its members. Instead of blaming U.S. 
				foreign policy or &quot;Islamophobia,&quot; Sacranie described the 
				bombings as a &quot;profound challenge&quot; for the Muslim community. 
				However, this is the same Sacranie who, in 1989, said that 
				&quot;Death is perhaps too easy&quot; for the author of &quot;The Satanic 
				Verses.&quot; Tony Blair's decision to knight him and treat him as 
				the acceptable face of &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; Islam is either 
				a sign of his government's penchant for religious appeasement or 
				a demonstration of how limited Blair's options really are.</NITF></font><p>
				<font face="Verdana"><NITF>Sacranie is a strong advocate of 
				Blair's much-criticized new religious-hatred bill, which will 
				make it harder to criticize religion, and he actually expects 
				the new law to outlaw references to Islamic terrorism. He said 
				as recently as Jan. 13, &quot;There is no such thing as an Islamic 
				terrorist. This is deeply offensive. Saying Muslims are 
				terrorists would be covered [i.e., banned] by this provision.&quot; 
				Two weeks later his organization boycotted a Holocaust 
				remembrance ceremony in London commemorating the liberation of 
				Auschwitz 60 years ago. If Sir Iqbal Sacranie is the best Blair 
				can offer in the way of a good Muslim, we have a problem.</NITF></font></p>

				</table>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>The Sacranie case illustrates the 
				weakness of the Blair government's strategy of relying on 
				traditional, essentially orthodox Muslims to help eradicate 
				Islamist radicalism. Traditional Islam is a broad church that 
				certainly includes millions of tolerant, civilized men and women 
				but also encompasses many whose views on women's rights are 
				antediluvian, who think of homosexuality as ungodly, who have 
				little time for real freedom of expression, who routinely 
				express anti-Semitic views and who, in the case of the Muslim 
				diaspora, are -- it has to be said -- in many ways at odds with 
				the Christian, Hindu, non-believing or Jewish cultures among 
				which they live.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>In Leeds, from which several of 
				the London bombers came, many traditional Muslims lead 
				inward-turned lives of near-segregation from the wider 
				population. From such defensive, separated worlds some 
				youngsters have indefensibly stepped across a moral line and 
				taken up their lethal rucksacks.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>The deeper alienations that lead 
				to terrorism may have their roots in these young men's 
				objections to events in Iraq or elsewhere, but the closed 
				communities of some traditional Western Muslims are places in 
				which young men's alienations can easily deepen. What is needed 
				is a move beyond tradition -- nothing less than a reform 
				movement to bring the core concepts of Islam into the modern 
				age, a Muslim Reformation to combat not only the jihadist 
				ideologues but also the dusty, stifling seminaries of the 
				traditionalists, throwing open the windows to let in much-needed 
				fresh air.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>It would be good to see 
				governments and community leaders inside the Muslim world as 
				well as outside it throwing their weight behind this idea, 
				because creating and sustaining such a reform movement will 
				require above all a new educational impetus whose results may 
				take a generation to be felt, a new scholarship to replace the 
				literalist diktats and narrow dogmatisms that plague present-day 
				Muslim thinking. It is high time, for starters, that Muslims 
				were able to study the revelation of their religion as an event 
				inside history, not supernaturally above it.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>It should be a matter of intense 
				interest to all Muslims that Islam is the only religion whose 
				origins were recorded historically and thus are grounded not in 
				legend but in fact. The Koran was revealed at a time of great 
				change in the Arab world, the seventh-century shift from a 
				matriarchal nomadic culture to an urban patriarchal system. 
				Muhammad, as an orphan, personally suffered the difficulties of 
				this transformation, and it is possible to read the Koran as a 
				plea for the old matriarchal values in the new patriarchal 
				world, a conservative plea that became revolutionary because of 
				its appeal to all those whom the new system disenfranchised, the 
				poor, the powerless and, yes, the orphans.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>Muhammad was also a successful 
				merchant and heard, on his travels, the Nestorian Christians' 
				desert versions of Bible stories that the Koran mirrors closely 
				(Christ, in the Koran, is born in an oasis, under a palm tree). 
				It ought to be fascinating to Muslims everywhere to see how 
				deeply their beloved book is a product of its place and time, 
				and in how many ways it reflects the Prophet's own experiences.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>However, few Muslims have been 
				permitted to study their religious book in this way. The 
				insistence that the Koranic text is the infallible, uncreated 
				word of God renders analytical, scholarly discourse all but 
				impossible. Why would God be influenced by the socioeconomics of 
				seventh-century Arabia, after all? Why would the Messenger's 
				personal circumstances have anything to do with the Message?</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>The traditionalists' refusal of 
				history plays right into the hands of the literalist 
				Islamofascists, allowing them to imprison Islam in their iron 
				certainties and unchanging absolutes. If, however, the Koran 
				were seen as a historical document, then it would be legitimate 
				to reinterpret it to suit the new conditions of successive new 
				ages. Laws made in the seventh century could finally give way to 
				the needs of the 21st. The Islamic Reformation has to begin 
				here, with an acceptance of the concept that all ideas, even 
				sacred ones, must adapt to altered realities.</NITF></font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana"><NITF>Broad-mindedness is related to 
				tolerance; open-mindedness is the sibling of peace. This is how 
				to take up the &quot;profound challenge&quot; of the bombers. Will Sir 
				Iqbal Sacranie and his ilk agree that Islam must be modernized? 
				That would make them part of the solution. Otherwise, they're 
				just the &quot;traditional&quot; part of the problem.</NITF></font></p>
