	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The sage of Bengal has pronounced. 
	Pluralism, we are informed, has an ancient pedigree in Indian history. It is 
	embedded in the oldest known texts of Hinduism and, like a river, has flowed 
	through Indian history (including the Mughal period, when the country was 
	under Muslim rule) till the arrival of the British in the eighteenth 
	century. It is this cultural heritage, ignored and misinterpreted by 
	colonialists and religious fanatics alike, that shapes Indian culture and 
	goes a long way toward explaining the attachment of all social classes to 
	modern democracy. The argumentative tradition &quot;has helped to make heterodoxy 
	the natural state of affairs in India,&quot; exerting a profound influence on the 
	country's politics, democracy and &quot;the emergence of its secular priorities.&quot; 
	This view informs most of the thought-provoking essays in Amartya Sen's new 
	book, a set of reflections on India written in a very different register 
	from his other books on moral philosophy and poverty. It is designed not so 
	much for the academy but as a public intervention in the country of his 
	birth, to which he remains firmly attached despite the Nobel Prize and his 
	latest posting at Harvard as a Boston Brahman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although the essays in The 
	Argumentative Indian were composed at different times, they have been 
	successfully welded into a single volume. There is much to agree with here. 
	Sen's lofty worldview remains staunchly secular and rationalist, as befits a 
	scholar whose intellectual formation took place in Nehru's India, a 
	historical time zone under constant attack today from Hindu nationalists on 
	the one side and some of the more fashionable Indian luminaries of the US 
	branch of the subaltern school of historians on the other. Unlike fellow 
	Nobel laureate V.S. Naipaul, Sen does not see the entry of Islam into India 
	as a dagger thrust in the heart of Indian civilization. On the contrary, he 
	argues that the effect of Mughal rule was beneficial. This was undoubtedly 
	the case on the dietary front: The historian Irfan Habib has shown how the 
	average Indian peasant ate better and more often in this period than under 
	the British. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the title of Sen's book, it 
	would be churlish to prove him wrong by simply nodding in approval, as is so 
	often the case in our wonderful subcontinent. What follows, then, from this 
	argumentative Pakistani is the expression of a few doubts concerning his 
	central thesis and the odd complaint with regard to some omissions. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can the lineages of modern Indian 
	democracy be traced back to the holy texts, as Sen suggests? And does the 
	affection of ordinary citizens for democracy have any material (as opposed 
	to mystical) links to the arguments once heard by Buddha or King Ashoka 
	(273-232 B.C.), let alone the Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605)? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It's true that disputes abound in 
	the ancient Sanskrit epics. Their multiple tales are, as Sen puts it, 
	&quot;engagingly full of dialogues, dilemmas and alternative perspectives,&quot; such 
	as that of Javali, the notorious skeptic of the Ramayana, who explains in 
	detail how &quot;the injunctions about the worship of gods, sacrifice, gifts and 
	penance have been laid down in the sastras [scriptures] by clever people, 
	just to rule over [other] people.&quot; In codifying the rules for debate in the 
	Buddhist councils, Ashoka demanded mutual respect among the various sects. 
	While the Inquisition was sowing terror in Europe, Akbar, himself a Muslim, 
	ruled that &quot;anyone is to be allowed to go over to a religion that pleases 
	him.&quot; The interreligious debates he organized in Agra included Hindus, 
	Muslims, Christians, Parsees, Jains, Jews and the atheists of the Carvaka 
	school, who argued that Brahmans had established ceremonies for the dead 
	only &quot;as a means of livelihood&quot; for themselves. Even the Vedic Song of 
	Creation on the origins of the universe ends in radical doubt: &quot;Who really 
	knows? Whence this creation has arisen--perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps 
	it did not--the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he 
	knows--or perhaps he does not know.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet the skepticism voiced by some 
	rulers and reflected in ancient texts was usually, if not always, confined 
	to the priestly elites. The model for the debates among scholars from 
	different religions and sects that were organized by Akbar's court was 
	little different from similar discussions a few centuries earlier in the 
	camp of Mongol leader Genghis Khan (1162-1227). With this exception: Mongol 
	soldiers were permitted to both listen and participate in the arguments. The 
	Mughal courts in India were sealed off from public view: The courtiers 
	listened and, no doubt, nodded when the emperor smiled appreciatively as a 
	point was scored, but they did not speak. Only the emperor and a few of his 
	close advisers posed questions. The tyranny of the few over the 
	many--exercised through a ritual combination of coercion and religion--was 
	never seriously challenged in India until the advent of capitalist 
	colonization. Nobody spoke for the subalterns. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unlike ancient Greece, there were no 
	city-based institutions where important issues could be debated, and the 
	overglorified village panchayats, or councils, were the domain of the 
	privileged where the poor could only appear as supplicants. Ancient India 
	produced an ugly caste system that led to early divisions and splits, but 
	neither Brahmanism proper nor its wilder offshoots--Buddhism and Jainism-- 
	came even close to producing a political philosophy that could lay the basis 
	for a popular or semipopular assembly like those in ancient Greece, whose 
	formal decrees always began with the invocation: &quot;The demos has decided.&quot; 
	The assemblies in Athens were barred to slaves, but they did include peasant 
	proprietors and even some peasants who worked for others. Hence the debates 
	between rich and poor; hence the fear of the multitude evinced by the 
	wealthy; hence Solon's New Deal- ish boast: &quot;I stood covering both [rich and 
	poor] with a strong shield, permitting neither to triumph unjustly over the 
	other.&quot; But even these traditions, while never forgotten, disappeared 
	completely. The idea of democracy re-emerged in the debates that followed 
	the English Revolution and found institutional form only after the American 
	and French revolutions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ancient India produced great poets, 
	philosophers and playwrights, along with art forms, gods and goddesses to 
	match anything on offer in Athens, but it did not give birth to an 
	Aristotle. And nothing remotely resembling the Assembly in Athens or the 
	Senate in Rome arose on the subcontinent. Surely this must reflect some 
	deficiency. Despite arguments within the elite and some wonderful 
	expressions of skepticism cited by Sen, the demos was kept under strict 
	control throughout Indian history. Uprisings threatening the status quo were 
	brutally crushed by Hindu and Muslim ruler alike. Superstition and 
	irrationality were institutionalized via a network of priestly domination.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The resilience of Brahman traditions 
	lay not in encouraging debate but in the power of the iniquitous caste 
	system that survives to this day and pervades the spirit of Indian 
	democracy. One wishes that Sen, a longstanding critic of economic 
	inequality, had given us his views on whether globalization tends to weaken 
	or strengthen caste chauvinism in India. When in the third decade of the 
	past century, the &quot;untouchable&quot; leader Dr. Ambedkar insisted that his caste 
	not be considered Hindu so that they, like the Muslims, could demand 
	separate electorates from the British rulers, he was sweetly rebuffed by 
	Mahatma Gandhi, no doubt for the noblest of reasons. Hard-core confessional 
	elements in the leadership of the ruling Congress Party were only too aware 
	that without the &quot;low castes&quot; being counted as Hindus their overall weight 
	in the population would be drastically reduced. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What of India's Muslims? The Mughal 
	conquest of India created a strong centralized state, but there was not even 
	an embryonic consciousness of democracy, even in its most primitive, 
	patrician form. The emperor was supreme. His subjects could plead for 
	justice in his presence once a week, and if they were lucky they could be 
	rewarded with a few coins and kind words. Interestingly enough, while all 
	the existing texts of classical Greece and Rome were translated into Arabic 
	during the eighth and ninth centuries, and while Islamic schools of 
	philosophy, mathematics, astronomy and medicine flourished in Córdoba, 
	Palermo and Baghdad, the one genuine innovation of the Greeks--the idea of 
	democracy--did not travel. The caliph was both the spiritual and the 
	temporal ruler, and any notion of an assembly of equals would have been seen 
	as a godless challenge to Allah's vice regent. The Mughal order in India was 
	based on an alliance of the wealthy and the creation of a strong central 
	bureaucracy with rights over large tracts of land. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sen is correct to stress the 
	tolerance of the Mughals, particularly Akbar, toward the non-Muslim 
	majority. The reasons for this policy, however, were not simply altruistic. 
	The Muslim conquerors, like the British after them, knew that stable rule 
	was dependent on securing the consent of crucial layers of the indigenous 
	elites. This they did successfully, and even the last of the great Mughal 
	emperors, the devout and narrow-minded Aurangzeb, presided over an imperial 
	army led by an equal mix of Hindu and Muslim generals. When the British East 
	India Company's army secured Bengal as a bridgehead in 1757 and made 
	Calcutta the first capital of British India, it did so with a very small 
	number of British officers, European weaponry and local recruits on a 
	monthly wage. Like its Mughal predecessor, the company was desperate for 
	allies and often bought them in the marketplace. The Bengali Renaissance 
	that produced Nobel Prize-winning writer and poet Rabindranath Tagore, 
	filmmaker Satyajit Ray, the Sens and numerous others was the result of a 
	unique synthesis between local tradition and imperial modernity, based on a 
	capitalist economy. Without capitalism there was no Indian modernity. 
	Democracy in British India (as in Britain itself) came a century and a half 
	later as a result of pressure from below on the part of a growing 
	middle-class intelligentsia in Calcutta. &quot;What Bengal thinks today,&quot; 
	declared the reformer Ram Mohun Roy, &quot;India thinks tomorrow.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That is why imperial ideologues as 
	well as colonial apologists like Rudyard Kipling came to despise Bengal. The 
	Bengalis, in their estimation, were effete intellectuals ill equipped to 
	fight, unlike the &quot;martial races&quot; of the Punjab and North-West Frontier. 
	Kipling's fiction is filled with crude stereotypes of the dark-skinned 
	Bengali babu (clerk) as contrasted with the noble and fair-skinned Pathan or 
	the Rajput warrior. Better they were kept illiterate lest they become uppity 
	like the Bengalis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even supposing there was a strong 
	&quot;argumentative&quot; tradition in India 3,000 years ago, was this the frail 
	aqueduct through which the democratic stream finally moved? Such is the 
	argument of Sen and (in a more fashionable formulation) of postcolonial 
	scholars who scornfully dismiss the suggestion that the British presence had 
	anything to do with the spread of democratic ideas and the rise of Indian 
	democracy. This is, in my view, a form of mysticism. We may not like it, but 
	there is no denying the impact of 150 years of British rule in India, which 
	brought capitalism to the country and overwhelmingly determined the nature 
	and character of Indian institutions. Sen accepts uncritically the historian 
	Partha Chatterjee's argument that, in Chatterjee's words, the emergence of 
	nationalism created its own domain of sovereignty within colonial society 
	well before its political battle with the imperial power. It does this by 
	dividing the world of social institutions and practices into two 
	domains--the material and the spiritual. The material is the domain of the 
	&quot;outside,&quot; of the economy...of science and technology...where the West has 
	proved its superiority.... The spiritual, on the other hand, is an &quot;inner&quot; 
	domain bearing the &quot;essential&quot; marks of cultural identity. The greater one's 
	success in imitating Western skills in the material domain...the greater the 
	need to preserve the distinctiveness of one's spiritual culture. Here one 
	discerns a retreat from the secular definition of nationhood espoused by 
	Nehru and a slide into the murky domain of Hindu nationalism, albeit in an 
	ultra-civilized fashion. In rejecting the heritage of Nehruvian socialism 
	for its statism and affiliation with the urban middle class, &quot;left-wing&quot; 
	postcolonial historians like Chatterjee have eerily converged in their 
	arguments with right-wing Hindu politicians, who insist that the content of 
	Indian nationalism has always been spiritual, i.e., religious, thus 
	excluding India's large Muslim minority from the national community. (When 
	the Hindu nationalist brigade in the United States mounted a disgraceful 
	campaign two years ago against the Library of Congress decision to award a 
	research fellowship to Romila Thapar, one of the most distinguished secular 
	historians of ancient India, a majority of Indian historians on American 
	campuses remained silent.) What is &quot;one's spiritual culture&quot; and &quot;cultural 
	identity&quot; if not religion, even if lightly disguised as the Cow Protection 
	League or the National Fund to Rebuild Mosques? Was it possible for 
	nationalism to move in a more cosmopolitan than spiritual direction? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This raises the Gandhi question. Was 
	it necessary for the Mahatma to use spiritual (Hindu) imagery and language 
	to rouse the majority of the countryside from their torpor? Nehru and Tagore 
	did not think so and argued heatedly with the old fox, but on this Gandhi 
	would not budge. It was they who gave up, Tagore in despair and Nehru in the 
	half-hope that the damage was reparable. But it wasn't, and it led 
	ultimately to the fatal breach with secular Muslims, including Mohammad Ali 
	Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. That there were other straws in the 
	nationalist breeze was revealed time and time again in the wave of strikes 
	that paralyzed the country in late 1945 and then again in 1946, when Muslim, 
	Hindu and Sikh naval ratings united against the British and seized the 
	ships, raising the banner of revolution. This was the most significant 
	mutiny in the history of the British Empire. On the advice of Jinnah and 
	Gandhi, the sailors surrendered &quot;to India not the British.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The attachment to the 
	&quot;distinctiveness of one's spiritual culture&quot; undoubtedly helped provoke the 
	bloody partition of the subcontinent, but the institutions that provided the 
	spinal cord of the new states owed little to spiritual traditions. They were 
	British creations, and Parliament was not the only one. It certainly helped 
	to unite India, but in neighboring Pakistan it is the army and, to a lesser 
	extent, the civil service, both creations of the Raj, that have ruled the 
	country. What happened to the &quot;argumentative&quot; tradition here? Taxila (near 
	Islamabad) was, after all, the site of one of the world's first large 
	(Buddhist) universities centuries before the Christian Era. It is not that 
	most Pakistanis did or do not like democracy. A new imperial power decreed 
	that the army was the most reliable guarantor of stability and order in the 
	new country. Here Washington has been consistent. Only this year Condoleezza 
	Rice, on a visit to Islamabad, praised Gen.Pervez Musharraf and his 
	regime--apparently secular and autocratic--as the model for the Muslim 
	world. (Including Iraq?) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India democracy has become 
	embedded as the only acceptable form of rule largely because of geography. 
	If Pakistan split into two after an eleven-year military dictatorship from 
	1958 to '69, what would an attempt to impose a military regime in India have 
	done to that country? Created a three-way split? Or even more fragments? The 
	regional elites realized that this would be an economic disaster, and the 
	unity of India under a democratic umbrella became the common sense of the 
	country. It is this and mass hostility to autocracy that explains the 
	longevity of the democratic system, but one should not underestimate the 
	power of turbo-propelled capitalism to weaken democracy in India just as it 
	is doing in its heartlands. Indians may want democracy, but it is hardly a 
	prerequisite for a dynamic capitalism. Europe demonstrated this during the 
	first 300 years of capitalism; China does so today. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The essay on the giant of Bengali 
	letters, Tagore (1861-1941), who died six years before India and his beloved 
	Bengal was partitioned, is studded with gems. Sen knows Tagore's work well, 
	and his grandfather, a distinguished historian of Hinduism, worked with the 
	great poet in Santiniketan, a progressive educational academy that provided 
	the inspiration for Dartington Hall in England. Tagore's standing in the 
	West has been subject to many fluctuations. His mystic-spiritual side 
	appealed to many Westerners, including Ludwig Wittgenstein, but as Sen 
	explains, this was only one side of the man. In Bengal and India he was the 
	voice of reason, a cosmopolitan who encouraged the self-emancipation of the 
	people and urged them to free themselves from the Brahman and the British 
	and break the chains of caste and poverty. The dangers he saw for India were 
	structural, not spiritual. As he wrote in 1939: &quot;It does not need a 
	defeatist to feel deeply anxious about the future of millions who, with all 
	their innate culture and their peaceful traditions, are being simultaneously 
	subjected to hunger, disease, exploitations foreign and indigenous, and the 
	seething discontents of communalism.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sen's reflections on Tagore, 
	however, would have benefited from comparison with another great Indian 
	poet: Muhammad Iqbal (1877-1938), who wrote in Urdu and Persian. Iqbal, too, 
	was given to mysticism, but of the Sufi variety. Younger than Tagore, he was 
	greatly influenced by Hegel and the German philosophical tradition and was a 
	great favorite of both Nehru and Jinnah. Iqbal, too, died before partition. 
	Tragically, he was immediately mummified by the new state of Pakistan, his 
	message so distorted that he is seen by many in that country as a 
	revivalist, which is far from the truth. Like Tagore, he loathed priest and 
	mullah alike and celebrated reason and knowledge, as in this verse dividing 
	God from Man: You created Night, I the Lamp You the earth, I the bowls You 
	created wilderness, mountains and ravines I the flower beds, gardens and 
	groves I make mirrors from stone I find antidotes in poison. Both Tagore and 
	Iqbal would have been mortified at the direction taken by the modern leaders 
	of the old subcontinent. Like Sen, both would have been alarmed by the 
	nuclear turn and missiles with confessional names targeted by each side 
	against the other. Even those who disagree with Sen or see him as a tame and 
	toothless Bengal tiger will be compelled to engage with his arguments. That 
	alone is sufficient reason to welcome the publication of this book.</font></p>
