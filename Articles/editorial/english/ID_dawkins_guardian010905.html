              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It sounds so reasonable, 
              doesn't it? Such a modest proposal. Why not teach &quot;both sides&quot; and 
              let the children decide for themselves? As President Bush said, 
              &quot;You're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to 
              different ideas, the answer is yes.&quot; At first hearing, everything 
              about the phrase &quot;both sides&quot; warms the hearts of educators like 
              ourselves. </p>
              <p align="justify">One of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it 
              was his habit to choose controversial topics for the students' 
              weekly essays. They were required to go to the library, read about 
              both sides of an argument, give a fair account of both, and then 
              come to a balanced judgment in their essay. The call for balance, 
              by the way, was always tempered by the maxim, &quot;When two opposite 
              points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does 
              not necessarily lie exactly half way between. It is possible for 
              one side simply to be wrong.&quot; </p>
              <p align="justify">
              <!-- This site/section combo is not set up to show MPU's -->As 
              teachers, both of us have found that asking our students to 
              analyse controversies is of enormous value to their education. 
              What is wrong, then, with teaching both sides of the alleged 
              controversy between evolution and creationism or &quot;intelligent 
              design&quot; (ID)? And, by the way, don't be fooled by the disingenuous 
              euphemism. There is nothing new about ID. It is simply creationism 
              camouflaged with a new name to slip (with some success, thanks to 
              loads of tax-free money and slick public-relations professionals) 
              under the radar of the US Constitution's mandate for separation 
              between church and state. </p>
              <p align="justify">Why, then, would two lifelong educators and 
              passionate advocates of the &quot;both sides&quot; style of teaching join 
              with essentially all biologists in making an exception of the 
              alleged controversy between creation and evolution? What is wrong 
              with the apparently sweet reasonableness of &quot;it is only fair to 
              teach both sides&quot;? The answer is simple. This is not a scientific 
              controversy at all. And it is a time-wasting distraction because 
              evolutionary science, perhaps more than any other major science, 
              is bountifully endowed with genuine controversy. </p>
              <p align="justify">Among the controversies that students of 
              evolution commonly face, these are genuinely challenging and of 
              great educational value: neutralism versus selectionism in 
              molecular evolution; adaptationism; group selection; punctuated 
              equilibrium; cladism; &quot;evo-devo&quot;; the &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot;; mass 
              extinctions; interspecies competition; sympatric speciation; 
              sexual selection; the evolution of sex itself; evolutionary 
              psychology; Darwinian medicine and so on. The point is that all 
              these controversies, and many more, provide fodder for fascinating 
              and lively argument, not just in essays but for student 
              discussions late at night. </p>
              <p align="justify">Intelligent design is not an argument of the 
              same character as these controversies. It is not a scientific 
              argument at all, but a religious one. It might be worth discussing 
              in a class on the history of ideas, in a philosophy class on 
              popular logical fallacies, or in a comparative religion class on 
              origin myths from around the world. But it no more belongs in a 
              biology class than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class, 
              phlogiston in a physics class or the stork theory in a sex 
              education class. In those cases, the demand for equal time for 
              &quot;both theories&quot; would be ludicrous. Similarly, in a class on 
              20th-century European history, who would demand equal time for the 
              theory that the Holocaust never happened? </p>
              <p align="justify">So, why are we so sure that intelligent design 
              is not a real scientific theory, worthy of &quot;both sides&quot; treatment? 
              Isn't that just our personal opinion? It is an opinion shared by 
              the vast majority of professional biologists, but of course 
              science does not proceed by majority vote among scientists. Why 
              isn't creationism (or its incarnation as intelligent design) just 
              another scientific controversy, as worthy of scientific debate as 
              the dozen essay topics we listed above? Here's why. </p>
              <p align="justify">If ID really were a scientific theory, positive 
              evidence for it, gathered through research, would fill 
              peer-reviewed scientific journals. This doesn't happen. It isn't 
              that editors refuse to publish ID research. There simply isn't any 
              ID research to publish. Its advocates bypass normal scientific due 
              process by appealing directly to the non-scientific public and - 
              with great shrewdness - to the government officials they elect.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">The argument the ID advocates put, such as it 
              is, is always of the same character. Never do they offer positive 
              evidence in favour of intelligent design. All we ever get is a 
              list of alleged deficiencies in evolution. We are told of &quot;gaps&quot; 
              in the fossil record. Or organs are stated, by fiat and without 
              supporting evidence, to be &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;: too complex to 
              have evolved by natural selection. </p>
              <p align="justify">In all cases there is a hidden (actually they 
              scarcely even bother to hide it) &quot;default&quot; assumption that if 
              Theory A has some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X, we must 
              automatically prefer Theory B without even asking whether Theory B 
              (creationism in this case) is any better at explaining it. Note 
              how unbalanced this is, and how it gives the lie to the apparent 
              reasonableness of &quot;let's teach both sides&quot;. One side is required 
              to produce evidence, every step of the way. The other side is 
              never required to produce one iota of evidence, but is deemed to 
              have won automatically, the moment the first side encounters a 
              difficulty - the sort of difficulty that all sciences encounter 
              every day, and go to work to solve, with relish. </p>
              <p align="justify">What, after all, is a gap in the fossil record? 
              It is simply the absence of a fossil which would otherwise have 
              documented a particular evolutionary transition. The gap means 
              that we lack a complete cinematic record of every step in the 
              evolutionary process. But how incredibly presumptuous to demand a 
              complete record, given that only a minuscule proportion of deaths 
              result in a fossil anyway. </p>
              <p align="justify">The equivalent evidential demand of creationism 
              would be a complete cinematic record of God's behaviour on the day 
              that he went to work on, say, the mammalian ear bones or the 
              bacterial flagellum - the small, hair-like organ that propels 
              mobile bacteria. Not even the most ardent advocate of intelligent 
              design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become 
              available. </p>
              <p align="justify">Biologists, on the other hand, can confidently 
              claim the equivalent &quot;cinematic&quot; sequence of fossils for a very 
              large number of evolutionary transitions. Not all, but very many, 
              including our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus. 
              And - far more telling - not a single authentic fossil has ever 
              been found in the &quot;wrong&quot; place in the evolutionary sequence. Such 
              an anachronistic fossil, if one were ever unearthed, would blow 
              evolution out of the water. </p>
              <p align="justify">As the great biologist J B S Haldane growled, 
              when asked what might disprove evolution: &quot;Fossil rabbits in the 
              pre-Cambrian.&quot; Evolution, like all good theories, makes itself 
              vulnerable to disproof. Needless to say, it has always come 
              through with flying colours. </p>
              <p align="justify">Similarly, the claim that something - say the 
              bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have evolved by natural 
              selection is alleged, by a lamentably common but false syllogism, 
              to support the &quot;rival&quot; intelligent design theory by default. This 
              kind of default reasoning leaves completely open the possibility 
              that, if the bacterial flagellum is too complex to have evolved, 
              it might also be too complex to have been created. And indeed, a 
              moment's thought shows that any God capable of creating a 
              bacterial flagellum (to say nothing of a universe) would have to 
              be a far more complex, and therefore statistically improbable, 
              entity than the bacterial flagellum (or universe) itself - even 
              more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to 
              have created. </p>
              <p align="justify">If complex organisms demand an explanation, so 
              does a complex designer. And it's no solution to raise the 
              theologian's plea that God (or the Intelligent Designer) is simply 
              immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation. To do so 
              would be to shoot yourself in the foot. You cannot have it both 
              ways. Either ID belongs in the science classroom, in which case it 
              must submit to the discipline required of a scientific hypothesis. 
              Or it does not, in which case get it out of the science classroom 
              and send it back into the church, where it belongs. </p>
              <p align="justify">In fact, the bacterial flagellum is certainly 
              not too complex to have evolved, nor is any other living structure 
              that has ever been carefully studied. Biologists have located 
              plausible series of intermediates, using ingredients to be found 
              elsewhere in living systems. But even if some particular case were 
              found for which biologists could offer no ready explanation, the 
              important point is that the &quot;default&quot; logic of the creationists 
              remains thoroughly rotten. </p>
              <p align="justify">There is no evidence in favour of intelligent 
              design: only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary 
              account, coupled with the &quot;default&quot; fallacy we have identified. 
              And, while it is inevitably true that there are incompletenesses 
              in evolutionary science, the positive evidence for the fact of 
              evolution is truly massive, made up of hundreds of thousands of 
              mutually corroborating observations. These come from areas such as 
              geology, paleontology, comparative anatomy, physiology, 
              biochemistry, ethology, biogeography, embryology and - 
              increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics. </p>
              <p align="justify">The weight of the evidence has become so heavy 
              that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who 
              are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data. 
              Evolution is a fact: as much a fact as plate tectonics or the 
              heliocentric solar system. </p>
              <p align="justify">Why, finally, does it matter whether these 
              issues are discussed in science classes? There is a case for 
              saying that it doesn't - that biologists shouldn't get so hot 
              under the collar. Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand 
              that we teach ID as well as evolution in science classes. It 
              would, after all, take only about 10 minutes to exhaust the case 
              for ID, then we could get back to teaching real science and 
              genuine controversy. </p>
              <p align="justify">Tempting as this is, a serious worry remains. 
              The seductive &quot;let's teach the controversy&quot; language still conveys 
              the false, and highly pernicious, idea that there really are two 
              sides. This would distract students from the genuinely important 
              and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse. 
              Worse, it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically 
              aspires to. Without needing to make a single good point in any 
              argument, it would have won the right for a form of 
              supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science. 
              And that would be the end of science education in America. </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>Arguments worth having ...</b> </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>The &quot;Cambrian Explosion&quot;</b> </p>
              <p align="justify">Although the fossil record shows that the first 
              multicellular animals lived about 640m years ago, the diversity of 
              species was low until about 530m years ago. At that time there was 
              a sudden explosion of many diverse marine species, including the 
              first appearance of molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms and 
              vertebrates. &quot;Sudden&quot; here is used in the geological sense; the 
              &quot;explosion&quot; occurred over a period of 10m to 30m years, which is, 
              after all, comparable to the time taken to evolve most of the 
              great radiations of mammals. This rapid diversification raises 
              fascinating questions; explanations include the evolution of 
              organisms with hard parts (which aid fossilisation), the 
              evolutionary &quot;discovery&quot; of eyes, and the development of new genes 
              that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently. </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>The evolutionary basis of human behaviour</b>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">The field of evolutionary psychology (once 
              called &quot;sociobiology&quot;) maintains that many universal traits of 
              human behaviour (especially sexual behaviour), as well as 
              differences between individuals and between ethnic groups, have a 
              genetic basis. These traits and differences are said to have 
              evolved in our ancestors via natural selection. There is much 
              controversy about these claims, largely because it is hard to 
              reconstruct the evolutionary forces that acted on our ancestors, 
              and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern humans.
              </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>Sexual versus natural selection</b> </p>
              <p align="justify">Although evolutionists agree that adaptations 
              invariably result from natural selection, there are many traits, 
              such as the elaborate plumage of male birds and size differences 
              between the sexes in many species, that are better explained by 
              &quot;sexual selection&quot;: selection based on members of one sex (usually 
              females) preferring to mate with members of the other sex that 
              show certain desirable traits. Evolutionists debate how many 
              features of animals have resulted from sexual as opposed to 
              natural selection; some, like Darwin himself, feel that many 
              physical features differentiating human &quot;races&quot; resulted from 
              sexual selection. </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>The target of natural selection</b> </p>
              <p align="justify">Evolutionists agree that natural selection 
              usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying genes 
              that give them a reproductive or survival advantage over others 
              will leave more descendants, gradually changing the genetic 
              composition of a species. This is called &quot;individual selection&quot;. 
              But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act at 
              higher levels as well: on populations (group selection), or even 
              on species themselves (species selection). The relative importance 
              of individual versus these higher order forms of selection is a 
              topic of lively debate. </p>
              <p align="justify"><b>Natural selection versus genetic drift</b>
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Natural selection is a process that leads to 
              the replacement of one gene by another in a predictable way. But 
              there is also a &quot;random&quot; evolutionary process called genetic 
              drift, which is the genetic equivalent of coin-tossing. Genetic 
              drift leads to unpredictable changes in the frequencies of genes 
              that don't make much difference to the adaptation of their 
              carriers, and can cause evolution by changing the genetic 
              composition of populations. Many features of DNA are said to have 
              evolved by genetic drift. Evolutionary geneticists disagree about 
              the importance of selection versus drift in explaining features of 
              organisms and their DNA. All evolutionists agree that genetic 
              drift can't explain adaptive evolution. But not all evolution is 
              adaptive. </p>
