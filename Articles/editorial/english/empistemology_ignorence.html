	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><span style="color: red">Peter 
	Rickman</span></b> <b>on the crucial importance of context</b></p>
	<p align="center">
  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	in Mukto-Mona on
	<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Type="REGENERATED" S-Format="%B %d, %Y" startspan -->February 13, 2007<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" i-checksum="41405" endspan --></font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A great deal has 
	been written on the roots of knowledge in sensory experience ordered by 
	reason. Have we given enough thought to our dependence on the contexts into 
	which we can place any information? I began to reflect on this as I watched 
	various knowledge quizzes on television and became more acutely conscious of 
	the vast areas of ignorance in all of us. To avoid seeming to look down my 
	nose at the limitations of others, I start with my own. I know, as was 
	brought home to me, next to nothing about the world of entertainment or 
	sport. People more knowledgeable in these areas would be astonished and 
	alarmed about ignorance in areas of more interest to me. It appears 
	widespread on the part of contestants (presumable chosen for not being 
	totally ignorant) of history, geography and politics. One man thought that 
	Lord Nelson had died at Waterloo, another had no idea that the Nile flowed 
	north, a third thought that it was Cleopatra who had asked for the head of 
	John the Baptist. Someone did not recognize Eisenhower as having been in 
	charge of the invasion of the Continent in the second world war. Examples 
	could be endlessly multiplied.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Within our own 
	civilisation and in everyday life we can manage pretty well. We recognize 
	familiar food and know what clothes, kitchen utensils and the like are for. 
	Other things around us hold some mystery: how does a computer work? What is 
	a website? How can I make my television set work when kicking it proves 
	ineffective? However in all these cases we know what experts to turn to.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is different 
	with such knowledge as understanding the problems of the Middle East, the 
	advantages and disadvantages of joining the Euro, the rights and wrongs of a 
	war with Iraq, or the reasons for the resurgence of rightwing parties in 
	many European countries. Of course newspapers deluge us with answers to 
	these questions, as do politicians.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In dealing first 
	with the purely epistemological issues we need to set aside personal 
	prejudices. True, I personally feel a little contemptuous—having learned 
	Latin and Greek in school—of broadcasters who do not realise that such words 
	as ‘media’, ‘criteria’ or ‘phenomena’ are plurals, while those who know 
	about pop stars would think of me as an old square (or whatever the term 
	young people now use for people like me). None of this, however, affects the 
	purely epistemological considerations that need to precede weighing the 
	implications for politics and other areas of practical life.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most 
	encompassing context of cognition is <i>time</i>, because all our 
	experiences are temporal. Immanuel Kant called it one of the forms of 
	intuition. There is no need to give here an account of Kant’s approach. 
	Enough to remind ourselves of aspects of time that provided his starting 
	point. There are features of time of which we are intuitively aware: it 
	represents an unbroken, irreversible succession of moments. We cannot wipe 
	it out. I cannot, except in thought, escape the linear succession of 
	moments, cannot jump into the future or into the past however eager I might 
	be to try it. I cannot walk in the park and meet my mother as a young girl.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the 
	medium of our reflections is not the empty form of time but the succession 
	of individual and collective experiences as retained or recalled in memory 
	and recorded in biographies and history. Not everything can be explained 
	historically but a great deal of light can be thrown on many things by 
	awareness of how they originated and developed.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly all 
	movement and material objects are encountered in <i>space</i>, Kant’s second 
	form of intuition. There are spatial relationships we know intuitively 
	rather than learning them from experience. For example, in our visual field 
	a straight line is the shortest path between distinct points and we do not 
	need to discover this by measurements. However, our experiences aren’t 
	simply framed by formal geometry but in the contexts of objects related in 
	space explored in more detail by astronomy, geography and all kinds of 
	environmental studies.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Numerous contexts 
	can be listed for various areas of knowledge; for example there are sport, 
	culture, and politics, and each subdivides into more specific ones, i.e. 
	different sports, different cultural spheres. There is also science with its 
	many disciplines. In many cases several contexts, such as history, politics 
	and geography, are all relevant.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All this is pretty 
	familiar and does not need explaining further. I only wanted to emphasise 
	that—except in the case of the newly born—experience is not inscribed on an 
	empty slate but absorbed into interlocking and expanding contexts. So 
	problems and failures arise not merely from lack of intelligence or the 
	absence of current information but from ignorance of the context.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We can now turn to 
	the value or importance of different kinds of knowledge and therefore of the 
	contexts relevant for acquiring it.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Politics is one of 
	the main spheres where all adults have a responsibility to make choices 
	which we would like to be as knowledgeable as possible. This is most obvious 
	in democracies, where we have a right to vote. True—a rare referendum 
	apart—we leave our governments to make the day-to-day choices, but we choose 
	these governments in the light of past performance, assessment of 
	personalities and, above all the promises and plans contained in their 
	election manifestos. Future elections are also judgement day for them.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How can we 
	citizens discharge our responsibility to choose well on polling day? 
	Democracy is based on the conviction that we are all capable of judgement in 
	two areas; of moral judgements as to what is right or wrong and of forming a 
	view of our most important aspirations. Knowledge of the facts on which we 
	are supposed to judge is another crucial matter because complex and elusive 
	factors can be at work. One good illustration is the issue of whether 
	Britain should join the Euro, which divides not only the political parties, 
	but often even members of the same party. Though I am literate and 
	interested in the matter, I must confess that in my case any inclination one 
	way or the other would be purely emotional and, my choice finally will have 
	to depend on whom I think I can trust.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I referred at the 
	outset to the ocean of ignorance in which we find ourselves. We can now pose 
	the following question, an answer to which involves epistemology: is it a 
	matter of laughing at or bemoaning the stupidity and mental laziness of most 
	of us, or a matter of pinpointing educational failures which could be 
	addressed? Certainly some issues are so complex and technical that only 
	experts can provide the answers. Here the best we can do is to assure 
	ourselves—as critically as we are able—that these experts are well qualified 
	and reasonably unbiased. But in many other cases better understanding and 
	greater knowledge could be within our reach if we are provided with the 
	contexts which epistemology shows to be relevant.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It would be idle 
	to bemoan the fact that the mass media are more concerned with their 
	circulation or size of audience, than with education. However it may be 
	worth while to make a point about our education. Clearly there is a sense in 
	wanting our education to be relevant to life. In consequence practical 
	skills such as plumbing, carpentry and the like are well rewarded and 
	specialised subjects such as engineering, medicine or economics have been 
	emphasised in our universities. There is nothing wrong with that but other 
	subjects no less important for our lives tend to be neglected.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">History as the 
	record of what happens in that all encompassing medium, time, is an example. 
	It is not just a record of what people, long dead, once did. It provides the 
	proper context into which to acquire current information so that it can be 
	used to make choices for the future. Thus history and geography are basic 
	requirements for being orientated in the world, i.e. to make knowledgeable 
	choices. We cannot, and need not know everything. You may be forgiven for 
	not knowing when precisely the battle of Pelusium was fought or where 
	precisely Pelusium is. But we should have an idea that an important factor 
	in England being a predominantly Protestant country was the defeat of the 
	Great Armada during the reign of Elizabeth I. It is also helpful to know 
	that two world wars occurred in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
	century. It is equally helpful for the understanding of our world to know 
	that Germany and France share a common frontier, or that Poland adjoins 
	Russia.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Epistemology is 
	important because what we think we know tends to determine our choices and 
	actions, our preferences, voting intentions, support of particular causes 
	and the like. Was the war against Iraq justified? What would be a just 
	solution of the Israel/Palestine conflict and how can it be achieved? Should 
	Britain adopt the Euro? Obviously philosophy by itself cannot answer 
	questions like these. However it can make a relevant contribution by 
	identifying the contexts of knowledge of which would help us to decide.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Epistemology is 
	intensely practical insofar as it issues a challenge to the mass media to 
	provide the relevant contexts to the issues of the day. Even more important 
	is its relevance for educational policy. Obviously education needs to 
	provide skills from reading and writing to vocational preparation. But it 
	also needs to provide the contexts for the kind of choice children will have 
	to make as human beings and citizens.</font></p>
