	</b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">Monica Ali novel, Brick Lane 
		(2003), is an epic saga about a Bangladeshi family living in the UK, and 
		explores the British immigrant experience. </font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is something deeply compelling 
	about arguments that nobody should be persecuted for their faith. Belonging 
	to any religious group should not turn you into a second-class citizen. 
	Muslims are too often at the bottom of the pile, and they have lobbied 
	hardest for this new provision. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Looking back over the decades at the 
	evolution of laws on hate crimes, equal opportunity and discrimination, it 
	seems fitting - a natural next step - to close the &quot;legal loopholes&quot; where 
	religious affiliation is concerned. But though I feel passionately that 
	certain groups in our society are disadvantaged and that more should be done 
	to help them, and though I am instinctively drawn to anything that purports 
	to banish harassment and discrimination, this draft law is anything but 
	enlightened. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What's the problem here? I think 
	there are many but I want to set them out in three broad areas. The first 
	concerns the differences between race and religion as far as free speech is 
	concerned. It is not in the faintest way plausible to vilify a particular 
	race and to claim that no harm is intended towards members, individually or 
	collectively, of that racial group. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religions, on the other hand, are 
	sets of ideas and beliefs. They should not be privileged over any other set 
	of notions. I am not bound to respect the idea that I may be reincarnated as 
	an insect or a donkey or that Jesus is the son of God or anything else that 
	I regard as mumbo-jumbo. Indeed, if there are aspects and practices of a 
	religion that conflict with my own notions and beliefs (of fairness and 
	justice and so on) then the moral onus is on me to speak up against them. If 
	I loathe the fact that Islam has been used to deny the right of women in 
	Saudi Arabia to vote then I ought to say so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My second area of difficulty 
	concerns the broad sweep, vagueness and general impracticality of the law as 
	it is currently written. The bill says that an offence will be deemed to 
	have been committed if &quot;having regard to all the likely circumstances the 
	words, behaviour or material . . . are likely to be heard or seen by any 
	person in whom they are . . . likely to stir up religious hatred&quot;. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Good grief! What does this mean? Who 
	is going to decide which circumstances are relevant and whether or not it is 
	&quot;likely&quot; that hatred will be &quot;stirred up&quot;? Going back to my previous 
	example, if I say that I loathe the way Islam is practised in Saudi Arabia 
	because it denies the democratic rights of women, what are the relevant 
	circumstances of my utterance? Are they that I also believe that Muslims 
	should be free from arbitrary arrest and detention, that the 
	underachievement of Muslims within our educational system should be urgently 
	addressed, and that the French were wrong to ban the wearing of the hijab 
	within schools? Or are the relevant or &quot;likely&quot; circumstances that in 
	Britain today hostility against Muslims is on the increase, that any 
	strongly worded criticism is going to inflame those feelings still further 
	and that someone who already has deep-seated prejudice and hatred towards 
	Muslims is &quot;likely&quot; to have that existing hatred thus &quot;stirred up&quot;? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Perhaps that sounds a little 
	far-fetched. But when I add a reminder that Polly Toynbee, a serious 
	commentator and longstanding equal-rights campaigner, was recently labelled 
	as Islamophobe of the Year at an award ceremony run by an Islamic group, it 
	sounds nothing of the sort. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, just how efficacious would 
	the law be in bringing about harmony? All the evidence suggests not at all. 
	Supporters point out that in 1987, Northern Ireland introduced a local law 
	against incitement to religious hatred. It seems strange that they would 
	even bring that up. Hate-speech laws in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and 
	the Netherlands have not resulted in a decrease in insults directed towards 
	Jews, Muslims, Turks, African immigrants or other minorities. In fact there 
	has been growth in support for the extreme right in those countries. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even if the evidence had pointed the 
	other way, I find I could not sign up. For, as Rahila Gupta of Southall 
	Black Sisters has pointed out, it would not only be the artistic community 
	paying the price. Whose voices will be silenced, she asks? Writers and so 
	on, certainly, &quot;but also the more vulnerable groups within religious 
	communities, like women, who may find the newly strengthened group rights 
	weaken their own position&quot;. Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti wrote about a rape in a 
	Sikh temple, a gurdwara. Her play deals with sexual abuse within a religious 
	community and this is a real issue. Less highly charged but no less real is 
	the way women find they &quot;cannot leave oppressive homes because of the 
	stranglehold of culture, religion and enforced mediation by religious 
	leaders&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The price of putting this kind of 
	curb on freedom of expression may seem like loose change to some; to others 
	it is a king's ransom. It must be wholeheartedly opposed. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><font color="#000080">Philip 
	Hensher</font></b> </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">Journalist, critic and author 
		Philip Hensher has written three novels, Other Lulus, Kitchen Venom and 
		Pleasured, as well as a collection of short stories, The Bedroom of the 
		Mister's House. </font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Home Officer Minister initially 
	in charge of the religious hatred legislation currently proceeding through 
	Parliament has said that &quot;wordsmiths&quot; must write and speak with 
	&quot;responsibility&quot;. Free speech must be used responsibly. Everyone must 
	understand that. Who decides if speech is being used responsibly? Why, the 
	authorities. Home Office ministers. The rule of law. The authorities in the 
	United States will decide whether protest is a responsible use of free 
	speech. So will the authorities in Iran, who have their own views on 
	responsibility. The necrocracy of North Korea would find absolutely nothing 
	to quarrel with in the notion that speech must be exercised responsibly. Nor 
	would any Chinese regime of the past 50 years. Responsibility is in the eye 
	of the government, the church, the Roi Soleil, the Spanish Inquisition and, 
	no doubt, Ivan the Terrible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Free speech, we generally accept, is 
	subject to reasonable restriction. Criminal libel or racist abuse, for 
	instance, are not generally permitted. The case for &quot;responsible&quot; exercise 
	of free speech, however, is not talking about reasonable restriction; it is 
	different from a parallel exercise taking place at the same time, to draw 
	the lines of &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; more tightly. What talk of 
	&quot;responsibility&quot; does is to insist on restrictions that are universally 
	appropriate. A statement may be perfectly legal, and yet - from this point 
	of view - deplorable because &quot;irresponsible&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is absolutely clear that, in most 
	of these cases, the case for &quot;responsible&quot; free speech is not being made to 
	those who use their power or authority to damage the speechless and the 
	powerless. There might be a case for saying that a powerful newspaper, a 
	government minister, ministers of the church, should not use their voices 
	irresponsibly against those who have no power of response. For instance, it 
	might justifiably be said that the British newspaper which published a 
	story, on no evidence at all, that asylum seekers were killing and eating 
	wild swans was abusing its authority. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, we might deplore, on the 
	grounds of &quot;responsibility&quot;, the lie spread, without any medical evidence, 
	by the Roman Catholic church in Africa, that the use of condoms is useless 
	against the transmission of HIV. Such bodies, perhaps, do have a duty to 
	consider the weight of their voices, and exercise their right of free speech 
	responsibly. But that is not what is meant here. In almost all cases, what 
	is being addressed is the free and reckless criticism of governments, of 
	religions, of authority of all kinds. The argument that individuals have, 
	individually, a duty to exercise free speech &quot;responsibly&quot; is not, despite 
	claims, a strengthening of the status of free speech. It is an attack on the 
	idea itself. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The progress of free speech has been 
	advanced over the centuries, not just by calm, rational argument, but by 
	excess and irresponsibility. Those who, with increasing noise, are insisting 
	that free speech can only be permitted when it is used &quot;responsibly&quot;, are 
	prescribing across the board a range of expression and a range of agreed 
	opinions. That is not free speech at all. If we want to hang on to the free 
	speech of individuals, we must personally insist on continuing the noble and 
	long history of irresponsibility. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#800000"><b>PLAYING WITH FIRE
	</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><b>Salman Rushdie
	</b></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">Salman Rushdie, b. Bombay, 
		India, June 19, 1947, is best known for his novels Midnight's Children 
		(1981 &amp; The Satanic Verses (1989). </font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rushdie's work hinges on his many 
	identities--an Indian Muslim who writes in English, whose family left India 
	for Pakistan, and who now lives in England. Midnight's Children (1981), 
	which first brought Rushdie a wide audience and won Britain's Booker Prize, 
	is an allegory about the birth of independent India. Shame (1983) focuses on 
	Pakistan's recent rulers. The Satanic Verses is a complex work whose two 
	protagonists, like Rushdie, are expatriate Indians. The passage describing 
	the birth of a religion resembling Islam are seen as blasphemous by Muslims, 
	and the book has been banned in most Islamic countries. Despite Rushdie's 
	denial of any intentional blasphemy, and his pubic decision in 1990 &quot;to 
	enter into the body of Islam after a lifetime spent outside it,&quot; his death 
	sentence remained in force. He as continued to write, however, publishing 
	both the children's tales in Haroun and the Sea of Stories and the essays in 
	Imaginary Homelands in 1991. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I never thought of myself as a 
	writer about religion until a religion came after me. Religion was a part of 
	my subject, of course; for a novelist from the Indian subcontinent, where 
	the supernatural and the mundane coexist in the streets and are considered 
	as being of the same order of reality, how could it not have been? But in my 
	opinion I also had many other, larger, tastier fish to fry. Nevertheless, 
	when the attack came, I had to confront what was confronting me, and to 
	decide what I wanted to stand up for in the face of what so vociferously, 
	repressively and violently stood against me. At that time it was often 
	difficult to persuade people that the attack on The Satanic Verses was part 
	of a broader, global assault on writers, artists and fundamental freedoms. 
	The aggressors in that matter, by which I mean the novel's opponents, who 
	threatened booksellers and publishers, falsified the contents of the text 
	they disliked, and vilified its author, nevertheless presented themselves as 
	the injured parties, and such was the desire to appease religious sentiment 
	even then that in spite of the murder of a translator in Japan and the 
	shooting of a publisher in Norway there was widespread acceptance of that 
	topsy-turvy view. In spite of all the public calls for violence to be done, 
	not a single person - in Britain or anywhere else - was arrested or charged 
	with any offence. I revisit these bad old days with extreme reluctance, but 
	I do so because now, 16 years later, religion is coming after us all, and 
	even though most of us probably feel, as I once did, that we have other, 
	more important concerns, we are all going to have to confront the challenge. 
	If we fail, this particular fish may end up frying us. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">People have always turned to 
	religion for the answers to the two great questions of life: where did we 
	come from? And how shall we live? But on the question of origins, all 
	religions are simply wrong. No, the universe wasn't created in six days by a 
	superforce that rested on the seventh. Nor was it churned into being by a 
	sky-god with a giant churn. And on the social question, the simple truth is 
	that wherever religions, with their narrow moralities, get into society's 
	driving seat, tyranny results. The Inquisition results. Or the Taliban.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And yet religions continue to insist 
	that they provide special access to ethical truths, and consequently deserve 
	special treatment and protection. And they continue to emerge from the world 
	of private life, where they belong, like so many other things that are 
	acceptable when done in private between consenting adults but unacceptable 
	in the town square, and to bid for power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In today's United States, for 
	example, it's possible for almost anyone - women, gays, African-Americans, 
	Jews - to run for, and be elected to, high office. But a professed atheist 
	wouldn't stand a popcorn's chance in hell. According to Jacques Delors, 
	ex-president of the European Commission, &quot;The clash between those who 
	believe and those who don't believe will be a dominant aspect of relations 
	between the US and Europe in the coming years.&quot; In Europe, the bombing of a 
	railway station in Madrid and the murder of the Dutch film-maker Theo van 
	Gogh are being seen as warnings that the secular principles that underlie 
	any humanist democracy need to be defended and reinforced. Even before these 
	atrocities occurred, the French decision to ban religious attire such as 
	Islamic headscarves had the support of the entire political spectrum. 
	Islamist demands for segregated classes and prayer breaks were also 
	rejected. Few Europeans today call themselves religious (just 21%, according 
	to a recent study); most Americans do (59%, according to the Pew Forum). The 
	Enlightenment, in Europe, represented an escape from the power of religion 
	to place limiting points on thought; in America, it represented an escape 
	into the religious freedom of the New World â€“ a move towards faith rather 
	than away from it. Many Europeans now view the American combination of 
	religion and nationalism as frightening. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The exception to European secularism 
	can be found in Britain, or at least in the government of the devoutly 
	Christian and increasingly authoritarian Tony Blair, which tried to 
	steamroller Parliament into passing a law against &quot;incitement to religious 
	hatred&quot; before the May 2005 general election, in a cynical vote-getting 
	attempt to placate British Muslim spokesmen, in whose eyes just about any 
	critique of Islam is offensive. Lawyers, journalists and a long list of 
	public figures warned that such a law would dramatically hinder free speech 
	and fail to meet its objective - that religious disturbances would increase 
	rather than diminish. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">New Labour is playing with the fire 
	of communal politics, and in consequence we may all be burned.</font></p>
