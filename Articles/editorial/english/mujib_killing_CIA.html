	<hr><b>Was the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his 
	family members on August 15, 1975 merely the result of personal malice and 
	an act out of sudden fury of some army officers?
	<p>Long investigation by veteran US journalist Lawrence Lifschultz has made 
	it clear that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy behind the dark episode of 
	August 15. </p>
	<p>Lifschultz in a number of investigative reports published in newspapers 
	made it clear that Khandaker Moshtaque and a quarter of US embassy officials 
	in Dhaka were closely involved with the small section of army officers in 
	the August 15 coup. </p>
	<p>At long last, Lifschultz disclosed the name of his &quot;very reliable 
	source&quot;, the then US ambassador in Dhaka Eugene Booster with whom he has 
	maintained close communication for the 30 years. </p>
	<p>Booster repeatedly objected to the conspiracy leading to the August 15 
	assassination, even issued written instruction in this regard, but failed to 
	prevent the then station chief Philip Cherry of US Central Intelligence 
	Agency (CIA) in Dhaka office from doing the conspiracy. </p>
	<p>Lifschultz's plan to publish an interview of Eugene Booster in this 
	regard remained unfulfilled as Booster passed away on July 7 last. </p>
	<p>The new-born Bangladesh could not save herself from the wrath of then 
	foreign secretary Henry Kissinger who could never forget that Bangladesh was 
	born in opposition to his suggestion. </p>
	<p>Along with Salvador Allende of Chile and Taiyoo of Vietnam, Bangabandhu 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was in Kissinger's political vendetta. </p>
	<p>What USA started during the Liberation War in 1971 with attempt to split 
	the Awami League using Khandaker Moshtaque and his accomplices continued 
	after the independence following a direct US instigation, resulting in the 
	carnage on August 15, 1975. </p>
	<p>On basis of his 30 years' investigation that included interviews with the 
	US sources, Moshtaque and others concerned, Lifschultz has written a series 
	of that tale. </p>
	<p>The first part of his four reports is published today.</b> </p>
	<hr>
	<p align="justify"><br>
	<font face="Verdana">The 30th anniversary of the August 15th military coup 
	in Bangladesh powerfully illustrates the dictum of William Faulkner that the 
	past is never dead, it is not even past. For those of us who lived through 
	the years of Bangladesh's 'War of Independence' and the decade of the 1970s, 
	we remember these dates as milestones of an era. They are markers on a road 
	we traveled to a destination many did not reach. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After thirty years Bangladesh still 
	lives with the legacy of the violent night of August 15th. Just over four 
	years from that dark March night in 1971 when Pakistani Army troops rolled 
	their tanks and armoured vehicles through the streets of Dhaka slaughtering 
	their fellow countrymen instead of accepting the outcome of national 
	elections they had agreed to accept, a small unit of the new Bangladesh Army 
	invoking the sordid tradition of Pakistan Army staged a traditional military 
	putsch. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Within hours, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
	symbol for many of an ideal of liberation, was dead in a military coup 
	d'etat that had run amok in a frenzy of killing. Mujib and almost his entire 
	family were slaughtered including his wife and sons, the youngest only 
	twelve. On that deadly night groups of soldiers broke into squads and 
	traveled around the city killing relatives of Mujib's family. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The pregnant wife of one relation 
	who attempted to intercede to save her husband's life was herself killed for 
	her efforts. Mujib's two daughters were abroad and they survived with Sheikh 
	Hasina years later becoming Prime Minister. Yet, only a year ago, she too 
	was nearly assassinated in broad daylight by a hit squad that still &quot;eludes&quot; 
	capture, demonstrating yet again Faulkner's insightthe past is not even 
	past. It is very much present. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The political configuration that 
	exists today is a direct descendant of August 15, 1975. The current Prime 
	Minister, Khaleda Zia, was the wife of the late General Ziaur Rahman, the 
	Deputy Chief of Army Staff in 1975, who played a crucial behind scenes role 
	in the plotting that preceded the coup and in the events which followed.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the American Embassy that night 
	political and intelligence officers tried to monitor the unfolding events. 
	But, there was one figure at the Embassy in the days that followed the coup 
	who was particularly unsettled. A small knot had settled in his stomach. The 
	events were an echo of what he had feared might happen months earlier and 
	which he had made strenuous efforts to prevent. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would meet this man in Washington 
	three years later. He became a critical source for me and clearly hoped the 
	information that he provided would one day lead to uncomfortable truths 
	being revealed and those responsible being held accountable. For the first 
	time in nearly thirty years I can identify this individual. I have been 
	freed from a restraint of confidentiality that I have adhered to for almost 
	three decades. But, be patient, with me a bit longer while I explain how and 
	why I came to meet this individual. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was one among many foreign 
	correspondents covering the coup. Yet, I was the only journalist reporting 
	these events for a major publication who had actually lived in Bangladesh as 
	a journalist. I was the Dhaka correspondent of the Far Eastern Economic 
	Review (Hong Kong) in 1974. The following year I moved to New Delhi and took 
	up a new position as South Asia Correspondent for the Review. The violent 
	death of Mujib would draw me into an inquiry that I could never have 
	anticipated would, again and again, hold me in its sway at different stages 
	of my life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My unusual source who worked at the 
	American Embassy that night would encourage me forward by his own honesty 
	and quality of integrity. He was one of those unusual individuals one 
	occasionally finds inhabiting an official bureaucracy. He was deeply 
	distressed about the coup and the subsequent killings. He was a man with a 
	conscience. Unlike the rest of us he knew something others did not and that 
	knowledge tore at his conscience. It was this sense of ethical 
	responsibility that brought us face-to-face in one of the more memorable 
	encounters I had as young reporter. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the coup against Mujib the 
	official story put about by the successor regime and its minions in the 
	Bangladesh press disturbed me. It didn't hold together. Moreover, the cracks 
	began to reveal rather curious links and antecedents. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The version of events which emerged 
	at the time was that six junior officers, with three hundred men under their 
	command, had acted exclusively on their own in overthrowing Mujib. The 
	motives for the coup were attributed to a combination of personal grudges 
	held by certain of the officers against Mujib and his associates, together 
	with a general mood of frustration at the widespread corruption that had 
	come to characterize certain elements of Mujib's regime. In short, according 
	to this view of events the coup was an ad hoc affair not a thought out plan 
	a year or more in the making. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The morning Mujib and his family 
	were killed, the figure installed by the young majors as President was 
	Khandakar Mustaque Ahmed, generally considered to be the representative of a 
	rightist faction within Mujib's own party, the Awami League. After the 
	putsch, Mustaque remained impeccably reticent about any part he personally 
	might have played in Mujib's downfall. He neither confirmed nor denied his 
	prior involvement. He simply avoided any public discussion of the question 
	and desperately attempted to stabilize his regime. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A year following the coup, after he 
	had himself been toppled from power and before his own arrest on corruption 
	charges, Mustaque denied to me in an interview at his home in the &quot;Old City&quot; 
	of Dhaka that he had any prior knowledge of the coup plan or piror meetings 
	with the army majors, who carried out the action. However, the majors who 
	staged the military part of the coup and were forced into exile within four 
	months by upheavals within the Bangladesh Army began to tell a different 
	tale. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In interviews with journalists in 
	Bangkok and elsewhere, bitter at their abandonment by their erstwhile 
	sponsors and allies, the majors began to talk out of school. They confirmed 
	prior meetings with Mustaque and his associates. A story began to emerge 
	that Mustaque and his political friends had been involved for more than a 
	year in a web of secret planning that would lead to the overthrow and death 
	of Mujib. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few months after the coup, a 
	mid-level official at the U.S. Embassy told me that he was aware of serious 
	tensions within the U.S. Embassy over what had happened in August. He said 
	that there were stories circulating inside the Embassy that the CIA's 
	Station Chief, Philip Cherry, had somehow been involved in the coup and that 
	there was specific tension between Cherry and Eugene Boster, the American 
	Ambassador. He had no specific details about the nature of this &quot;tension&quot; 
	only that there were problems. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said, &quot;something happened 
	that should not have happened.&quot; He urged me to dig further. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">American involvement in the coup 
	didn't make sense to me. In the United States, two Congressional Committees 
	were gearing up to investigate illegal covert actions of the Central 
	Intelligence Agency. The so-called Church and Pike Committee hearings in 
	Washington on CIA assassinations of foreign leaders had begun. The committee 
	hearings were having their own impact within the American diplomatic and 
	intelligence bureaucracies creating great nervousness and anxiety. The 
	American press was openly speculating that senior American intelligence 
	officials might face imprisonment for illegal clandestine action in Chile 
	and elsewhere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was the summer when citizens of 
	the United States first heard acronyms like MONGOOSE, COINTELPRO, AM/LASH 
	and elaborate details of assassination plots against Lumumba in the Congo, 
	Castro in Cuba and Allende in Chile. The covert hand of American power had 
	touched far and wide. Now the tip of the iceberg was publicly emerging so 
	that for the first time Americans could take a clear look. Yet, all that was 
	happening far away in Washington, in a muggy heat as sultry as any South 
	Asian monsoon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India, Indira Gandhi, speaking of 
	the tragedy of Mujib's death, spoke of the sure hand of foreign involvement. 
	As usual, Mrs. Gandhi was graphically lacking in details or specifics. 
	However, her avid supporters during those first nuptial days of India's 
	Emergency, the pro-Moscow Communist Party of India (C.P.I.) were more 
	explicit: the CIA said the CPI was behind the coup. I dismissed this as 
	propaganda based on no specific evidence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, how had the coup happened? 
	There were still huge gaps in my knowledge of how specific actors had 
	traveled through the various mazes they had constructed to disguise their 
	movements yet which ultimately led to August 15th. I was living in England 
	nearly three years after the coup when I decided to make a trip to 
	Washington to visit a colleague of mine, Kai Bird, who was then an editor 
	with The Nation magazine, published from New York. Today he is a prominent 
	American author. </font></p>
