	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On February 25, Philippines 
	President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced that the authorities uncovered a 
	plot to topple her democratically-elected government and replace it with a 
	civil-military junta. Arroyo, who has survived at least two coup attempts 
	and numerous other crises during her five tumultuous years in power, said 
	the plan was to employ rallies, timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary 
	of the 1986 rebellion, in calling for civilian support. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This and the consequent declaration 
	of the state of emergency in the country serve as fresh evidence that the 
	Philippines, which is often described as Asia’s sick man, is moving from bad 
	to worse and is still far from stability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two decades after the so-called 
	People’s Power revolt that ended president Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorial 
	regime and re-established democratic rule, the political environment became 
	more fractured. There have been endless intrigues, with traditional elites 
	continuing to hold on the reigns of finance and power, the poor remaining 
	poor, soldiers dying in battles against communist or Muslim rebels, and the 
	country’s economy continuing to falter with much dependence on remittances 
	from overseas workers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a result, questions have been 
	raised about the viability of liberal democracy in a country like the 
	Philippines, where people are “prone to loyalty towards personalities rather 
	than institutions or ideals”, according to former president Fidel Ramos’s 
	sister, Leticia Shahani. Many among the elite are now of the opinion that 
	democracy is not a prescription for the Philippines’ economic progress or 
	political stability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The alternative, however, may lead 
	to nothing but isolation and further economic damage. In an international 
	environment characterized by promoting institutional democracy and 
	disapproving regime change through military coups, it would be difficult for 
	a military or authoritarian regime to win the recognition and support of 
	global and regional powers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Philippines has a long history 
	of coups and mutinies since Marcos was pushed from power in February 1986. 
	Marcos’s successor Corazon Aquino, for example, survived at least five coup 
	attempts during her six-year term in office. In almost all the cases, coup 
	attempts were carried out by junior officers, backed by opposition figures 
	and retired generals, initiated in the heart of the business district of 
	Makati, and justified by corruption allegations. In all cases also there 
	were rumours swirling of a plot ahead of the actual attempt with accusatory 
	fingers being always pointed to Gregorio Honasan. The latter, a veteran from 
	the 1986 rebellion, had instigated several coups in the late 1980s and gone 
	into hiding for sometime before he went into politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recent plot, however, differ 
	from the previous ones in two aspects. First, it was engineered by various 
	elements from both the left and right. According to official sources, the 
	conspiracy was a result of an alliance that included junior officers, 
	retired generals, resigned ministers, communist rebels, and members of the 
	political opposition and some non-government organizations, including the 
	corruption-tainted former president Joseph Estrada’s supporters. Some 
	reports have also mentioned that Aquino and Ramos knew about the plot or at 
	least would not mind it. Aquino, still a popular and respected figure 
	despite her poor achievement while in office, has repeatedly urged Arroyo to 
	“make the supreme sacrifice by resigning”. Ramos, whose six-year term from 
	1992 to 1998 was characterized by relative political calm and notable 
	economic progress, has also demanded on several occasions that she step 
	down, calling her “small-minded and self-centered”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, the plot was said to be a 
	response not only to increased graft and corruption but also to Arroyo’s 
	interference in the vote count in the 2004 presidential election. To many 
	Filipino groups and individuals, she has lost her legitimacy, first by her 
	husband and eldest son’s involvement in a nationwide gambling syndicate and 
	second by her involvement in vote-rigging. But Arroyo, a US-educated 
	economist and the daughter of late president Diosdado Macapagal, believes 
	that she is the best person to lead the nation through economic and social 
	reforms and is strongly convinced that she has right on her side. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The coup attempt also seemed to be a 
	reflection of the mounting grievances of junior officers from combat units. 
	It was said that these officers have been dissatisfied with being on the 
	front lines battling communist and Muslim insurgencies or fighting the Abu 
	Sayyaf pirate gang while their commanders grow rich on cash dispensed by 
	politicians in Manila. Arroyo’s response has been that the military must 
	stay out of politics regardless of the situation. But her opponents say she 
	has little credibility when it comes to defining the military’s role. Arroyo 
	herself came to office in 2001 with the backing of the military.</font></p>
