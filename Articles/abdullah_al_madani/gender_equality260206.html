	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the 1980s, the Japanese have 
	been concerned about gender issues. This resulted in a law passed by 
	parliament in 1985 to ensure gender equality at work. In recent years, 
	however, there has been increasing pressure on the government to do more.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The number of working women in Japan 
	is high to the extent that one may get the impression no gender gap exists. 
	But the bitter truth is that they are still the last to be recruited with 
	obvious discrimination against them in terms of posts and wages, not to 
	mention housing and other allowances, which are exclusively paid to the head 
	of the household who is presumably the male. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to a gender-gap survey 
	conducted last year by the World Economic Forum, Japanese women ranked 52nd 
	and 54th out of 58 developed and emerging economies in terms of economic and 
	political empowerment respectively. The percentage of women occupying 
	management positions in the world’s second- largest economy has not exceeded 
	10%, and only 30% of women keep their jobs after childbirth. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another survey conducted last year 
	by the Cabinet Office’s Gender Equality Bureau revealed that 63% of Japanese 
	firms had no plans to recruit women, despite the latter’s proven talents. 
	This may partially explain why only 11.6% of the country’s scientific 
	researchers are women. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2000, Japan was ranked 41st in 
	terms of gender equality out of 70 countries surveyed by the United Nation 
	Development Programme. The method used included four criteria: the ratio of 
	seats women hold in parliament, the ratio of female administrators and 
	managers, the ratio of female professionals and technical workers, and the 
	income women earn. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This indicates that Japan’s 
	position, despite numerous efforts to improve the status of women, is still 
	weak when it comes to gender equality. Japan is not only far behind other 
	developed and emerging economies, such as South Korea, but also falls behind 
	some developing countries, such as the Philippines. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In South Korea, for example, the 
	status of women is increasingly improving due to legislations on the 
	promotion of women’s employment and the quota system, which provides that 
	not less than 30% of candidates running in general elections be women. But 
	such a system is difficult to introduce in Japan because of a lack of 
	national consensus on the issue, according to some officials. As a result, 
	female candidates in the 2000 general elections, for example, accounted for 
	14.4% of the total runners and only 7.3% of those elected. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Factors behind gender gap include 
	Japan’s highly structured society where the status of women is subordinate 
	to that of men and the strictly male-dominated working environment. Another 
	factor has been women’s weak participation in political life and their 
	consequent lack of power within the decision-making institutions to impose 
	changes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Attached to gender discrimination is 
	domestic violence, an issue that until the 1990s has been hidden by the 
	Japanese culture of shame. According to a survey conducted in 2000 by the 
	Prime Minister’s Office, 4.6% of women, or 1 out of 20, are subjected to 
	life-threatening violence. Japanese writer Hiromi Ikeuchi argues that 
	husbands’ violence against wives or fathers’ violence against daughters are 
	mostly caused by “the nature of Japan’s highly stressful society”, not by 
	alcohol abuse, drug addiction, or poverty. She believes that current laws 
	and penalties do not respond to all problems because domestic violence is 
	often difficult to be discovered and because “the law does not generally 
	intervene in household problems”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While gender equality is a 
	challenging issue in many countries, it is of tremendous demographic and 
	economic impact in Japan. Today, one in four females prefers not to get 
	married or not to have children because otherwise she is expected to quit 
	her job and stay at home to raise children. Poor child support for working 
	mothers, prejudices within the working environment, inflexible hours for 
	working, and the prevailing tradition that only women should undertake 
	domestic chores prevent Japanese females from having a family and a job 
	simultaneously. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because of this, the fertility rate 
	has been falling, making Japan’s birth rate one of the lowest in the world. 
	The total fertility rate, which was around 2.1 in the 1960s and 1970s, fell 
	to a record low of 1.29 in 2004. If the present trends continue, Japan’s 
	population will shrink from its present number of 127 million to 65 million 
	by the end of this century, according to demographers. Economists predict 
	that the declining population will negatively affect Japan’s economy from 
	2010 onward, especially with its rapidly ageing society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The situation has forced Prime 
	Minister Junichiro Koizumi to approve a new plan aimed at redressing the 
	perceived failures of a gender equality law enacted 20 years ago. But the 
	plan is expected to be slow, given the conservative camp’s opposition.</font></p>
