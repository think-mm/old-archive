	<p align="justify"><tt><font face="Verdana">One year has already passed 
	since the Indian Ocean catastrophe on December 26,2004, an event that killed 
	approximately 290,000 people, left almost two million homeless, and caused 
	economic damage worth billions of dollars in a dozen countries. This an 
	opportunity to focus on what has been done in the past 12 months with regard 
	to reconstruction projects and humanitarian efforts in the tsunami-hit 
	region. It is also an opportunity to shed light on the lessons<br>
	learned from the disaster.<br>
	<br>
	The world responded to the catastrophe with unprecedented generosity, 
	pledging more than $10.5 billion, $7 billion of which has so far been handed 
	over according to the United Nations office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami 
	Recovery. Thus, there was enough supply of aid and funds that could pay for 
	everything. The problem, however, was how to make the best use of the money.<br>
	<br>
	It has been reported that the aid effort was hampered by factors such as 
	lack of information, poor management, and corruption. As a result, thousands 
	of families who were not seriously affected by the tsunami have received 
	more aid than those who lost everything. In Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the 
	most tsunami-hit nations,thousands of survivors did not receive any aid due 
	to the lack of information about distribution points compounded with the 
	lack of transportation to reach such points. And in Thailand and South Asian 
	countries, many survivors expressed their dissatisfaction with the 
	disproportion between their losses and compensations offered, saying they 
	could not re-establish their lives.<br>
	<br>
	Moreover, the reconstruction process has been slow, especially in the most 
	devastated Indonesian province of Aceh, where only 20 percent of houses have 
	so far been rebuilt. Although many schools and kindergartens have been 
	rebuilt and refurnished in Aceh by foreign volunteers, especially from 
	Singapore and Japan, tens of thousands of children remain without schooling 
	or attend classes in temporarily tents. One of the major pressing problems 
	there is the lack of<br>
	teachers. It was reported that some 5,000 Acehnese teachers died in the 
	disaster in the capital city of Banda alone.<br>
	<br>
	Tourism in the tsunami-hit region, on which millions of people depend 
	directly or indirectly for making their living, has also not fully 
	recovered. The best example could be derived from Phuket, Thailand’s most 
	popular holiday spot,where tourist arrivals are 50 percent lower than 
	pre-tsunami levels. In other tourist hotspots in the region, horrifying 
	images of the destruction also dissuaded tourists from making a return.<br>
	<br>
	Foreign and local groups in charge of humanitarian and reconstruction 
	operations do not rule out mistakes and mismanagement. But they attributed 
	them to the lack of experience in the handling of such a huge disaster 
	hitting several countries simultaneously. Besides, most of the tsunami-hit 
	areas are known for their rigid topography, overpopulation, and poor 
	infrastructure and logistic facilities, not<br>
	to mention insecurity constraints resulting from insurgencies.<br>
	<br>
	Several lessons, therefore, can be learned from the disaster. One is the 
	need to beef up regional first lines of defence both in terms of disaster 
	preparedness and prevention, particularly in developing countries. Another 
	key lesson is the importance to set up clear measures for effective 
	cooperation and coordination among UN agencies, the Red Cross, the military, 
	and NGOs.<br>
	<br>
	Suggestions proposed by experts and geologists include the setting up of 
	early warning systems that would help give people time to head for higher 
	ground, the building of structures that are strong enough to withstand the 
	waves, and the putting up of buffer zones along the coastline. This, 
	however, must be accompanied by specific programmes aimed at educating 
	people on how to cope with disasters and promoting their water knowledge and 
	skills, something that Sri Lankan NOGs have already launched.<br>
	<br>
	Such measures and plans must not be ignored, especially with famous Thai 
	meteorologist and seismologist Smith Dharmasaroja warning of the occurrence 
	of a new big earthquake and tsunami in the future. According to him, “the 
	next one would be further north than the 2004 tsunami, which brings the 
	Straits of Malacca and –more disturbingly- Singapore and Malaysia into 
	range”. His predictions, largely based on tsunami record data for the last 
	two centuries and on 30 years of studies, should be taken seriously. After 
	all he is the man who<br>
	has been predicting, since 1988, that Phuket island and India’s surrounding 
	islands of Andaman and Nicobar would be hit by a huge tsunami. Having been 
	proven right in December 2004, he was appointed as a vice-minister in the 
	office of Thai prime minister. </font></tt></p>
