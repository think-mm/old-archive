	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Waziristan, a tribal region of 
	11,585 square kilometers in the northwest of Pakistan, is historically known 
	as the land that cannot easily be conquered or subjugated. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Its extremely mountainous terrain 
	helped it successfully resist all invaders, including the Mughal, Sikh, and 
	British armies. A more important factor, however, has been its conservative 
	tribal inhabitants, who are traditionally known for being supreme fighters, 
	proud of their Islamic faith and Pathan descent and fiercely concerned about 
	their independence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having realized this, the British 
	colonial authority let Waziristan became an independent territory outside 
	the bounds of effective British rule when the Durand Line was established as 
	the border between Afghanistan and British India in 1893. Similarly, 
	Pakistan’s founding father Mohammed Ali Jinnah did not insist on fully 
	controlling the region at the time of the creation of Pakistan in 1947, 
	leaving it to retain its traditional autonomy. But Jinnah was the first to 
	exploit the fighting talent and religious zeal of Waziristan’s tribesmen, 
	when he incited them to lead Pakistan’s first war in Kashmir in 1947-48. 
	This was repeated in the 1980s by the country’s military dictator General 
	Zia-ul-Haque, who used them as cannon fodder during the Afghan War. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Successive Pakistani governments 
	have chosen to continue this practice of pacification while establishing 
	influence through compromise with and payment of subsidies to tribal 
	chieftains. The latter, in their turn, have shown cooperation with 
	Islamabad, but have also managed to extort it with the aim of increasing 
	their financial muscle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The remnants of Al-Qaeda and Taliban 
	forces, of course, were fully aware of all this when they chose Waziristan 
	to be their hideout after the Americans pushed them out of Afghanistan in 
	2001. In Waziristan, they would not only ensure an isolated and remote 
	shelter, but would also enjoy widespread popular support and many other 
	advantages that could be employed in rebuilding their forces, planning and 
	launching terrorist activities across the border, and consequently causing a 
	headache for the Kabul government and US-led coalition forces. In addition 
	to its location on the Afghanistan border, financial muscle resulted from 
	trading in drugs, and a large pool of weapons left over from the time of 
	Jihad against the Soviets, Waziristan has been hosting tens of thousands of 
	Afghan refugees since the 1980s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Washington soon realized the new 
	challenge posed by Waziristan, especially after offensives against Afghan 
	and American forces have increased and intelligence confirmed the existence 
	of a large number of foreign terrorists in the region. In response, it 
	sought the cooperation of the Pakistanis with the hope that it could squeeze 
	the enemy between its own special forces coming from the west and Pakistani 
	security forces moving from the east. According to this strategy, Islamabad 
	began in 2002 to build military bases in Waziristan for the first time, 
	ending its traditional policy of not running large in the region. Actual 
	clashes between security forces and local and foreign militants, however, 
	began in 2003 and intensified in the following years with sporadic calmness.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to recent reports from 
	Waziristan, the Pakistani army seems to be facing serious difficulties 
	there, despite its well trained soldiers and more advanced guns. It is true 
	that it has launched many successful campaigns that resulted in the 
	destruction of several terrorist camps and the arrest or killing of hundreds 
	of extremists. But it is also true that it has been confronted with tough 
	resistance, including the killing, wounding, and kidnapping of hundreds of 
	its troops. Moreover, terrorist militants and their Waziri supporters have 
	managed to launch offensives across the Pakistan-Afghan border. This has 
	resulted in a serious crisis between Islamabad and Kabul in the recent 
	weeks, a development that Al-Qaeda and Taliban’s forces must be happy about.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Difficulties faced by the Pakistani 
	army in the region could be attributed to factors other than the rigid 
	nature of the battlefield and the toughness of pro-Taliban Waziri tribesmen. 
	There is no national consensus on the army’s role in Waziristan, despite 
	President Pervez Musharraf’s repeated calls upon Pakistani people, parties 
	and tribes to support his policy of ridding the countries of all foreign and 
	local terrorist groups or face dire consequences from Washington’s wrath. On 
	the other hand, the regime’s weak domestic position has prevented it from 
	fully cooperating and coordinating with Washington and Kabul to properly 
	squeeze Waziristan. This was clear earlier this year when US forces took 
	alone an initiative to strike inside Pakistani areas. Islamabad was quick 
	not only to deny its knowledge of or involvement in the operation but also 
	to protest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the aforementioned factors, 
	the current problem in Waziristan is not expected to end soon. It is rather 
	expected to develop into a long and larger war with serious future 
	implications for both Pakistan and Afghanistan. </font></p>
