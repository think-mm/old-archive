  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on
	July 20, 2005</font></b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like in the post-September 11 days, 
	Islamabad is once again under mounting pressure from the West, given three 
	of the four young men involved in the July 7 London bombings are of 
	Pakistani descent and are said to have spent time in Pakistan’s religious 
	schools or madrassahs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the September 11 events, 
	Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf acted quickly by distancing his country 
	from the Taliban regime in Kabul and joining the US-led war on terror, 
	something that has ensured his regime’s survival. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The key question now is could he 
	successfully escape the new situation? The answer depends on the way he will 
	deal with thousands of madrassahs – once described by former US secretary of 
	state Colin Powell as “breeding grounds for fundamentalists and terrorists”.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Stung by charges from Washington 
	that he allows terrorism to breed under the guise of religious education, 
	Musharraf has tried in recent years to regulate these madrassahs beginning 
	with a requirement that they report on the numbers and names of students and 
	teachers, types of facilities, educational programmes, and financial 
	details. Besides, he urged them to broaden their curriculum by teaching 
	modern subjects. The move, however, has not generated the desired results. 
	Only some 4000 of the estimated 50,000 madrassahs agreed to be regulated. 
	The others firmly rejected the plan, dubbing it “foreign-sponsored” and 
	describing Musharraf as a pawn in the hands of America. One of these 
	madrassahs’ leaders openly told Jessica Stern of the Harvard University that 
	Musharraf’s reform plan was against Islam. He added that where states have 
	taken control of madrassahs, such as in Jordan and Egypt, “the engine of 
	jihad is extinguished”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In recent weeks, and as a result of 
	the Pakistani connection to the London bombings, Pakistani security forces 
	detained 600 Islamist extremists in several raids on madrassahs and other 
	centres across the country. Musharraf should be praised for this, but such 
	an occasional action may no longer serve as assuasive. There is mounting 
	evidence that Pakistan’s madrassahs are still the major source of extremism 
	and hate and will continue to be so if they are left operating. Let us 
	remember that many of those involved in terrorist acts in recent years 
	passed through these madrassahs or had links with them. In addition to the 
	six most senior Al-Qaeda leaders arrested so far and the London bombers, the 
	list includes Richard Reid, the failed shoe-bomber, Saajid Badat, who has 
	admitted plotting to blow up a plane bound for America in 2003, Ahmed Omar 
	Sheikh, who killed American journalist Daniel Pearl, Osama Nazir, the bomber 
	of a church in Islamabad in 2002, and Omar Khan Sharif and Asif Mohammed 
	Hanif, the two bombers of a café in Tel Aviv in 2003. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the most dangerous madrassahs 
	is Darul Uloom Haqqania- where most of the Taliban leadership was educated. 
	Christina Lamb of the London-based Times, who recently visited the school, 
	said that the only posters on the walls were of Kalashnikovs and bin Laden 
	and that the young students she spoke to were unable to do simple 
	calculations and had never heard of dinosaurs or astronauts landing on the 
	moon. When she asked them what they wanted to be in future, many talked of 
	becoming jihadis and ending as martyrs so they would go to paradise. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another equally dangerous madrassah 
	is Khuddamddin. Its principal once proudly told a reporter that nearly 
	13,000 trained jihad fighters of different nationalities had passed through 
	his school, adding that “the world has to go the way we want and all people 
	must become Muslim”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf, therefore, needs to do 
	more, not for the sake of the West but for the sake of Pakistan and its 
	youth. This must include shutting down all madrassahs, enrolling their 
	estimated 2 million students in the state-run schools, upgrading the 
	country’s educational system, and spending more on the sector. Pakistan is 
	currently one of only 12 nations in the world to spend less than 2 percent 
	of GDP on education. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such a task, however, cannot be 
	undertaken without solid commitments from the international community to 
	assist the Musharraf regime both politically and economically. The West, in 
	particular, must play the major role in any such plan, simply because a 
	massive mushrooming of the madrassahs and a significant increase in their 
	militancy was a result of the West-baked jihad war against the Soviets in 
	the 1980s. As explained by a former Pakistani official, there were only 2000 
	madrassahs in Pakistan at the time of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 
	1979, all of which taught orthodox Islam but were by no means militant.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In brief, without the aforementioned 
	plan and enough proper, free state-run schools, millions of poor Pakistani 
	parents will have no alternative but to send their children to the 
	madrassahs, where the fiery mix of fundamentalism and intolerance is 
	creating cannon fodder for religious wars around the world.</font></p>
