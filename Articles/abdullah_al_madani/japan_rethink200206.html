	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In recent years the Japanese have 
	been involved in serious debates over the future of the Chrysanthemum 
	throne, especially with Emperor Akihito (72) getting old and having been 
	treated from prostate cancer. Known for being punctilious and subtle 
	planners, the Japanese are uncomfortable with leaving important issues such 
	as the imperial succession undecided or open to speculation. This is despite 
	the fact that Akihito has two sons, Crown Prince Naruhito (45) and Prince 
	Akishino (40), who would ensure the continuity for many years to come.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fear stems from the fact that no 
	boy has been born to the imperial family since 1965. Thus no one is 
	practically qualified to meet the terms provided by the Constitution and the 
	Imperial Household Law (IHL) and succeed Princes Naruhito and Akishino.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Article 2 of the current 
	Constitution, which went into effect in May 1947, provides that the imperial 
	throne shall be dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the IHL passed 
	by parliament. The IHL of 1947 limits succession to the throne to males of 
	the male line of imperial descent. In other words, it retained the exclusion 
	of female dynasts found in the 1889 Meiji Constitution, despite several 
	historical precedents in which imperial princesses ascended the throne. 
	Among the 125 monarchs who legitimately succeeded to the throne since the 
	accession of the first monarch, Emperor Jimmu, in 660 BC, eight were 
	females. The last Empress was Go-Sakuramachi whose reign began in 1762 and 
	ended in 1771 with her abduction in favour of her nephew Emperor 
	Go-Momozono. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 1947 IHL also abolished the 
	concubine system in the imperial family, making the situation more 
	difficult. Until Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, boys born to the 
	emperor and his concubines were recognized as possible successors to the 
	throne. It has been said in recent months that Emperor Akihito’s cousin 
	Prince Tomohito leads a campaign to restore the concubine system as a 
	possible succession solution. Tomohito’s argument is possibly based on the 
	fact that Japanese imperial dynasty owes much of its longevity in the male 
	line to the use of concubines. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another reported solution has been 
	the re-introduction of the adoption system in order to enable the Crown 
	Prince and Princess to adopt a male child, presumably from former royal 
	descendants. Adoption, an age-old imperial Japanese tradition, was 
	prohibited for dynastic purposes only in modern times. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the most supported solution 
	to a potential heir crisis, according to public opinion surveys, is that 
	Japan’s laws of succession should be changed from male-only primogeniture to 
	equal primogeniture. In other words, allowing females of the imperial 
	household to inherit the throne of the world’s oldest continuous hereditary 
	monarchy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is why Prime Minister Junichiro 
	Koizumi appointed a special panel in January 2005 comprising judges, 
	university professors, and high ranking civil servants to study changes to 
	the IHL. The panel’s recommendation, disclosed in November, was in favour of 
	amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to 
	ascend the throne, something that Koisumi pledged to do by the end of 
	Parliament’s current session in June. The first to benefit from the proposed 
	change is Princess Aiko, the Crown Prince’s five-year-old daughter, who will 
	be the second in line to the throne and will have precedence over her uncle.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recommendation was seen as a 
	triumph for the pro-reform camp led by Koisumi, who has been showing 
	increasing support for gender equality in Japan’s male-dominated society. 
	But the conservative politicians, including many prominent members of the 
	ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), hastened to criticize it. To them, 
	the proposed change poses a threat to the imperial dynasty as Princess Aiko 
	may marry a common or a foreigner in the future. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A royal announcement on February 6 
	stating that Prince Akishino’s wife Princess Kiko is expecting a baby in the 
	autumn, however, has temporarily stalled the discussion and forced Koizumi 
	to shelve his plan. If the baby turns out to be a boy, he would be the third 
	in line to the throne, and support for changing the law would quickly 
	dwindle. Otherwise, Koizumi is expected to submit his Bill to Japanese 
	parliament before he steps down as LDP leader in September. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many groups and individuals in 
	Japan, however, seem to support changing the IHL, regardless of the 
	expecting child’s sex, in order to have a ruling empress and consequently a 
	symbol for social reform on women’s issues in the country. This was why The 
	Japan Times, one of the country’s leading dailies, recently carried an 
	editorial expressing its hope that Princess Kiko’s child would be a 
	daughter.</font></p>
