	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The visit to India this week of King 
    Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia is certainly an historical event. 
    This is not only because of its nature, level, timing, and implications but 
    also because of the two countries’ regional weight, and influence. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us first not forget that the visit 
  is the first of its kind in half a century. Since the visit of the former 
  Saudi monarch King Saud to New Delhi in December 1955, neither Saudi leaders 
  nor their deputies or even high ranking royal officials have come to India. 
  The only exception was a short visit in 1981 by the Kingdom’s Foreign Minister 
  Prince Saud Al-Faisal to discuss the consequences of the Afghan and Iran-Iraq 
  wars. This fact was often used by observers as evidence that Indo-Saudi 
  relations lacked genuine warmth and confidence. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The visit, on the other hand, is 
  important because it is taking place in an era characterized by unprecedented 
  global and regional changes, and at a time when both countries are faced by 
  similar challenges, particularly the challenge of fighting terrorism. 
  Moreover, Saudi Arabia, as well as other Arab Gulf states, seems to be moving 
  further toward a new policy based on the ‘Look East’ concept, something that 
  has been the centre of focus and demand by some Gulf elite since the 1990s. 
  This coincides with what can be describe as new boom in the region resulting 
  from the sharp increases in oil prices, and with the consequent intention of 
  the Gulf states to direct their new financial capability towards productive 
  rather than consuming projects. India, which has been showing increasing 
  concerns about the Gulf region’s security, stability, and prosperity 
  -motivated in particular by its growing needs for energy- is one of Asia’s 
  rising powers that could massively help and benefit from this new boom. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another significance of the visit is 
  that it is taking place 18 months after a historical agreement between the GCC 
  countries and India to establish a multi-dimensional economic partnership as a 
  prelude for a free trade zone between the two regions. Six months before that, 
  an unprecedented meeting in Mumbai comprising ministers of industry and 
  leading businessmen from the GCC and India had resulted in the ‘Mumbai 
  Declaration’, in which both parties clearly stressed the need to 
  systematically develop bilateral cooperation in all fields. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The visit is also a clear indication 
  that the two countries have liberated their views of each other from suspicion 
  and mistrust that have long overshadowed their bilateral relations. In other 
  words, it is an indication that their ties are no longer affected by 
  ideological and emotional factors or by positions towards a third party, and 
  that they are only governed by national interests. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The event is fuelling optimism in the 
  same way King Saud’s visit did five decades ago. At that time, many were 
  certain that cooperation and coordination between the two nations would 
  promote peace, security, and development in both the Middle East and the 
  Indian Sub-continent. Such a belief was reinforced with the joint communiqué, 
  issued at the end of the visit, reflecting the two countries’ harmonious 
  outlook with regard to regional and global issues. More important, however, 
  was the Saudi monarch’s speech in which he said: “I desire to say to my Muslim 
  brethren all over the world with satisfaction that the fate of Indian Muslims 
  is in safe hands”. This public statement by the guardian of the two Muslim 
  holiest places was significantly important for the Indians, especially with 
  Pakistan’s attempts to turn the Islamic world against New Delhi on the pretext 
  that the latter discriminated against its Muslim minority. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, Indian prime minister 
  Jawaharlal Nehru’s visit to Riyadh in 1956 gave accentuation to the two 
  countries’ political understanding, especially with Nehru writing to his chief 
  ministers that the trip was a great experience for him and brought Delhi and 
  Riyadh closer. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This, however, did not last long. In 
  the late 1950s and the following decades, the relationship suffered a set 
  back. The consequences of the Cold War; the division of the Arab world into 
  two ideology-based camps and India’s Cairo-centric Arab policy; the Kashmir 
  cause and consequent Indo-Pakistani hostility and wars; the Saudi-Pakistani 
  military and security alliance; Riyadh’s promotion of the notion of Islamic 
  Solidarity, India’s strategic alliance with the communist Soviet Union; and 
  differences over the jihad war in Afghanistan have all varyingly contributed 
  at different times to the building of clouds in Indo-Saudi relations. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In brief, relations, since the 
  establishment of diplomatic ties in 1954, have lacked a regular pattern of 
  development. Moreover, every time they were about to witness a real 
  breakthrough, the road happened to be blocked by the emergence of a new 
  irritant issue, leading to further misgivings and suspicions. However, despite 
  the scarcity of political and strategic understanding, both parties have 
  successfully managed to avoid overt escalation, sustaining diplomatic contacts 
  and economic cooperation throughout the years. This could mainly be attributed 
  to the absence of any genuine or direct conflicting issue between them. It 
  could also be attributed to a variety of considerations including Indians’ 
  age-long interactions with Arabs, mutual economic interests, New Delhi’s 
  traditional pro-Arab policy, and Riyadh’s concern about maintaining contacts 
  with India’s huge Muslim minority. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With nearly all the aforementioned 
  dividing factors being part of history and the two countries embracing common 
  views, perceptions, and goals, the road is now paved as it has never been for 
  a fruitful, long-term, multi-dimensional, and strategic partnership.</font></p>
