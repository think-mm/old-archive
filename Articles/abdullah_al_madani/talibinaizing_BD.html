	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What has been a matter of constant 
	denial by the Dhaka government has now come to be proved. The reference here 
	is to the spate of bombings of August 17, which clearly confirmed the 
	existence of Al-Qaeda-like minded terrorist groups in Bangladesh. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the morning of August 17, around 
	500 bombs blasted simultaneously in 60 cities and town across the country, 
	targeting government buildings, court houses, public parks, shopping centres, 
	and busy streets. Fingers of accusation are pointed to Jamaat-ul- Mujahideen 
	of Bangladesh (JMB), an outlawed Islamic extremist group, especially with 
	thousands of leaflets in Bengali and Arabic being found at the bombing sites 
	carrying the name of the group. Only those who believe in conspiracy 
	theories and accordingly hold Western, Zionist, or Indian intelligences 
	responsible of any destructive operation have said otherwise. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In these two-page leaflets, the JMB 
	demands the setting up of Islamic laws, describes democracy as an 
	anti-Islamic concept that has been introduced by Kafirs (non-believers) and 
	Mushriks (pagans), threatens to restore to Qital (all-out killing), and 
	prescribes severe punishment for the American and British leaders. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the mid-1990s, there have been 
	many reports warning of Bangladesh’s gradual slide towards becoming a new 
	hub of Islamic extremists. This became more obvious after Bangladesh 
	National Party (BNP) came to power in 2001 through an alliance with the 
	Jamaat-e-Islami (JEI), a mainstream political party that maintains strong 
	ideological ties with a party bearing the same name in Pakistan and that is 
	sympathetic to Al-Qaeda and the deposed Afghan Taliban. The JEI and other 
	Islamic parties have employed their partnership with BNP and position in the 
	ruling coalition government to actively support and give shelter to Muslim 
	extremist groups and individuals, including those who entered Bangladesh 
	illegally from Arab and Asian countries. After all, and regardless of their 
	names and banners, they share one ultimate goal: the replacement of 
	Bangladesh’s current democratic multi-party system with a Sharia-based 
	government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such covert protection of extremist 
	groups has helped the latter become capable of establishing themselves well 
	and of launching bomb attacks on public rallies and movie theatres, 
	persecuting the minority Ahmadiya Muslim community, or assassinating 
	non-Muslim citizens, liberal intellectuals, secular journalists, and members 
	of the opposition Awami League (AL). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prime Minister Begum Khalida Zia’s 
	government has remained silent and indifferent, something that can only be 
	explained by Mrs. Zia’s intention to appease her Islamist partners and 
	ensure their support for a longer stay in power. It could also be her 
	satisfaction with Islamic militant groups targeting in particular AL’s 
	members and leaders, including her arch-rival former Prime Minister Sheikh 
	Hasina Wajid. The latter survived a bomb attack last year, in which 22 
	killed and 300 wounded. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, the Zia government has 
	established a tradition of denying international and Western reports 
	concerning Bangladesh, only to reverse its stand and acknowledge such 
	reports under pressure and the fear of international sanctions. For example, 
	it first dismissed the presence in Bangladesh of organizations funding 
	extremist Islamic schools and groups, but under Washington’s pressure it 
	acknowledged that, shutting down the seventy branches of Saudi Arabia-based 
	Al-Haramain foundation. Similarly, it denied reports talking about child 
	labour in the country and the export of Bangladesh children to the Gulf to 
	work as camel jockeys, but due to international pressure it admitted 
	existence of such practices and promised to resolve them. Faced with the 
	threat of aid curtailment from the European Union, it also admitted the 
	presence in Bangladesh of some extremist organizations, whose members have 
	been accused by human rights groups of targeting unveiled women and minority 
	communities. To appease foreign donors, it banned the JMB in February and 
	arrested some of its cadres, but not the group’s head Moulana Abdur Rahman 
	and its operational chief Siddiqur Rahman (better known as Bangla Bhai), who 
	had earlier been described by Dhaka as a figment of the media’s imagination.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What happened recently should be a 
	wake-up call for Mrs. Zia’s government and party. It was good of her to 
	finally recognize that the country was awash with terrorists and extremists 
	and to launch a campaign against them. But this is surly not enough to meet 
	the threat caused by the Islamic militants’ agenda of destroying the modern 
	nation-state of Bangladesh and establishing a Taliban-like theological 
	state. What is needed is a sincere effort by Zia to end the ongoing 
	meaningless hostility between her and Sheikh Hasina and to form a national 
	unity government comprising of the country’s two main parties, BNP and AL. 
	This would be the least she could do for the sake of protecting an entity 
	and a system, for which Bangladeshis had sacrificed millions of lives in 
	1971.</font></p>
