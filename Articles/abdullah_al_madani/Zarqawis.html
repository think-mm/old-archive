	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For several years, Riduan Isamuddin 
    (an Indonesian better known as Hambali), the operational chief of Al-Qaida-linked 
    Southeast Asian terror network Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), had been the region’s 
    most-wanted terrorist. Since his arrest in 2003 by the Thai authorities, 
    however, the title has passed to two Malaysians suspected of masterminding a 
    string of terrorist attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali nightclub 
    bombings, which killed 202 people. The two wanted fugitives are: Noordin 
    Mohamed Top (35), known as the ‘Moneyman’ for his skills in fund-raising and 
    recruiting bombers, and Azhari Hussain (45), dubbed the ‘Demolition Man’ for 
    his reputed expertise in explosives. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To some degree, both men seem to be 
    copying in Indonesia what Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi has been 
    doing in Iraq since the collapse of Saddam Hussain’s regime. This, of 
    course, is not surprising as they share the same miserable goals and violent 
    culture and have many things in common. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Apart from being fanatics, sharing 
    the idea of establishing an Islamic caliphate, serving Al-Qaida’s agenda of 
    jihad against infidels, and having the skills of eluding capture, they are 
    waging jihad from countries adjoining their own. Like Al-Zarqawi who fled to 
    Iraq after Jordan tried him in absentia and sentenced him to death, Noordin 
    and Azhari fled Malaysia to Indonesia to escape a police crackdown on their 
    JI in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. 
    Another common factor is the Afghan connection. Both Al-Zarqawi and Azhari 
    reportedly were in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where they received 
    bomb-making and other advanced training. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet there are a number of 
    dissimilarities between the Iraqi insurgency’s barbarian leader and the two 
    most-sought Malaysian fugitives. While Al-Zarqawi is known by many in Jordan 
    as a simple and barely literate gangster, both Malaysians have an excellent 
    educational and vocational background. Azhari, a former university teacher, 
    studied mechanical engineering at Adelaide University in Australia before 
    getting a doctorate in property valuation from Britain’s Reading University 
    in 1990. And Noordin, a former accountant, is a graduate of the Malaysian 
    Technical Institution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is also a difference 
    concerning their positions within the two terrorist organizations. While Al-Zarqawi 
    is the undisputed leader of the Al-Qaida organization in Iraq, the two 
    Malaysians’ positions in the JI leadership are a matter of arguments among 
    observers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some believe that Noordin is the 
    strategist planner and chief recruitment officer and Azhari is the most 
    prominent field commander of JI, ruling out any suggestion that they are top 
    leaders of the group. This has been based on information collected in recent 
    years, all of which indicated that the two men have always been instructed 
    to go ahead with bombings by figures believed to be senior JI officials.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of these figures is Zulkarnaen, 
    for whom Indonesian security forces have recently intensified their hunt in 
    east Java on the basis of telephone interceptions. Another is Dulmatin, an 
    electronics specialist with training in Al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan, who 
    is believed to be hiding in southern Philippines, where many of JI’s cadres, 
    including Azhari, received bomb-making training. Perhaps what confirms he is 
    a key JI leader is a recent decision by Washington to put a $11 million 
    bounty on his head. Two other men can be added as certainly part of the 
    group’s central command: Abu Dujana and Qotada. Both had been seen holding 
    two meetings with Noordin and Azhari: one shortly before the 2003 suicidal 
    attack on the Jakarta Marriott hotel to finalize the plot, and the other 
    shortly after the plot was carried out to evaluate its performance. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other observers are of the idea that 
    Noordin and Azhari now lead a new generation of terrorists and head a newly 
    founded organization that is more hardline than the JI. This could be true, 
    given what Sidney Jones, the Southeast Asia director of the International 
    Crisis Group, described as a split in JI between pro-bombing and 
    anti-bombing factions, combined with weakness in the group’s administrative 
    structure, finances and logistics. Add that several prominent figures in JI, 
    including its spiritual leader Abu Baker Bashir and its top operational 
    planner Ali Gufron, have been arrested and persecuted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The October 1 suicide attack in 
    Bali, which killed at least 26 people, therefore, could be the first 
    operation carried out by the new group.</font></p>
