	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In recent months, the Ahmadiyya 
	community in Indonesia, where the great majority of the population are Sunni 
	Muslims, has been subjected to repeated assaults. Armed with sticks and 
	stones, hundreds of Indonesian Muslim extremists have reportedly attacked 
	the community’s mosques and schools and set fire to its members’ houses and 
	cars, particularly in West Java. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This unprecedented anti-Ahmadiyya 
	wave is believed to be triggered by a fatwa issued in July by the official 
	Council of Indonesian Ulamas, which describes Ahmadiyya, as well as 
	liberalism and secularism, as anti-Islam. The fatwa and consequent events 
	were viewed by many Indonesians, including President Susilo Yudhoyono, as a 
	threat to the country’s doctrine of ‘unity in diversity’ or Bhinneka Tunggal 
	Ika. Abdurrahman Wahid, the former president and head of Indonesia’s largest 
	Muslim organization, Nahdhatul Ulama, and many other moderate politician and 
	activists accused the government of doing little to protect Indonesia’s 
	tolerant, multi-cultural image and of being hesitant and scared of extremist 
	forces. They also claimed that elements within the state’s apparatus have 
	been supporting and protecting radical Muslims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Ahmadiyya community in 
	Indonesia, estimated at 200,000 members, was established in 1926 but 
	formally recognized in 1953. The sect’s strong hold, however, has always 
	been in North India and Pakistan with a presence in 160 other countries. It 
	claims of having 200 million followers worldwide. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While they enjoy the right of 
	self-identification and other freedoms in India, Ahmadis in Pakistan are 
	denied such rights. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistani fundamentalist parties and 
	groups hold the view that Ahmadis are not Muslim and accordingly they have 
	tried since the 1950s to target them, pressing the government to ban the 
	sect and its activity. Interestingly, the government, during the era of the 
	country’s founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his immediate successor, 
	showed no interest in imposing any restriction on Ahmadis, and went to the 
	extent of appointing one of its prominent followers, Zafarullah Khan, as 
	Pakistan’s first foreign minister. Some attributed this to opposition 
	expressed by officials then representing East Pakistan, who were against 
	turning Pakistan into a theocratic state. Others attributed it to Jinnah’s 
	view of Ahmadiyya and the latter’s staunch support to the idea of partition 
	and creation of Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jinnah, in a press conference in 
	Kashmir in 1944, said that Ahmadis were Muslim, adding “Who am I to declare 
	a person, who calls himself a Muslim, as non-Muslim”. On another occasion in 
	1947, Jinnah was quoted as telling the Ahmadiyya’s followers: “You are free. 
	You may belong to any religion, caste, or creed. That has nothing to do with 
	the business of the State”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such an official view, however, 
	changed with Islamist forces becoming more influential in the country, 
	especially after the independence of East Pakistan. The beginning was with 
	the constitutional amendment of 1974 placing the Ahmadiyya community among 
	non-Muslim minorities. This was followed by other restrictions, particularly 
	during the rule of President Zia-ul-Haq, all of which harassed Ahmadis and 
	created an atmosphere of religious intolerance that contributed to violence.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Bangladesh, where Ahmadis number 
	100,000, the government has not officially declared them as non-Muslims. But 
	in recent years, there have been several attacks in Dhaka and other cities 
	on the community by Muslim extremist organizations, such as Khatme Nabuwat 
	and Jaish-e-Mustafa. In a development reflecting the hardliners’ growing 
	influence, the government last year banned the publication and sale of all 
	books on Islam published by the community, saying they might hurt the 
	sentiments of the country’s majority Muslim population. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But what is the Ahmadiyya? And why 
	is it rejected by mainstream Muslims? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Ahmadiyya was established in 
	Pakistan in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, from Qadian in Punjab, who claimed 
	that he was the recipient of divine revelation in the manner of the Prophet 
	Muhammad and that he had been sent into the world in the power and sprit of 
	Jesus. Upon his death in 1908, he was succeeded by Maulana Hakeem Nooruddin 
	whose death in 1914 marked the split of Ahmadiyya into two groups: the 
	Qadianis and the Lahorites. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ahmadis accept all the principal 
	Islamic beliefs, including the oneness of Allah. But by claiming that Ghulam 
	Ahmad is a prophet, they repudiate one of the fundamental tenets of Islam, 
	namely the finality of the Prophet Muhammad. This is viewed by mainstream 
	Islam as blasphemous and, therefore, has been used as a justification to 
	declare them as non-Muslims. Other controversies include the sect’s belief 
	that Jesus was crucified but then was revived, left Palestine to preach 
	among the lost tribes of Israel, and eventually arrived in Kashmir, where he 
	died at the age of 120. Mainstream Muslims believe that Jesus was not 
	crucified, but made to look as though he had been, and that he ascended to 
	heaven from where he would return to revive Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ahmadis also reject jihad, saying it 
	can only be used in the case of extreme religious persecution of one’s 
	faith, not as political weapon or an excuse for invading others’ 
	territories.</font></p>
