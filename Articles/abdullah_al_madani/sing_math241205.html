	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the 1990s, Singaporean 
	students have been scoring the highest results in international competition 
	in both mathematics and science, outperforming their counterparts from other 
	nations including the United States and the European countries. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Evidence can be derived from the 
	first, second, and third rounds of the Trend in International Mathematics 
	and Science Study (TIMSS) conducted in 1995, 1999, and 2003. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The TIMSS, a project run by the 
	Boston-based International Association for Evaluation of Educational 
	Achievement, is aimed at assessing the relative strength and weakness of 
	various countries’ educational programmes. Released in December 2004, the 
	results of the third and latest study affirmed the high quality of 
	mathematics education in Singapore. Of 230,000 pupils from more than 40 
	countries, Singaporean students compiled the highest average achievement 
	scores in the subject. South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan were the 
	next highest performers respectively, while the US ranked far behind them.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Among the Arab countries, Lebanon, 
	followed by Jordan, scored the highest results, with which they ranked 31st 
	and 32nd respectively. With such a poor performance by Arab countries, one 
	would rather remain silent to avoid invoking embarrassment. However, some 
	Arab commentators, instead of focusing on the secret behind Singapore and 
	other Asian nations’ magnificent results, have expressed their happiness, 
	only because Asian countries outperformed the US. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Key elements contributing to 
	Singapore’s excellent performance in the TIMSS and other similar tests 
	include students’ educational aspiration and attitude towards mathematics 
	and science, the educational resources available in schools and at home, and 
	the school climate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These, in turn, are attributed to 
	two principal factors: the government’s continuous and heavy investment in 
	education and the country’s educational system. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the 1990s, more than 6 percent 
	of the country’s GDP has been devoted to education, making Singapore match 
	the levels of Japan and the US. The goal has been to develop the talents of 
	every individual so that each could contribute to the economy and to the 
	ongoing struggle to make Singapore productive and competitive in the 
	international marketplace. The result was an education system that stressed 
	the assessment, tracking, and sorting of students into appropriate 
	programmes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The system is referred to as being 
	one of the best in the world. It is flexible and caters to every child’s 
	abilities, interest, and aptitude so as to help each develop to his fullest 
	potential. Having studied the system and realized its outcome, some American 
	scholars now wonder if the US should emulate it to achieve Singapore’s 
	success in the TIMSS. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the Singaporean 
	ministry of education’s policy, a variety of strategies for promoting 
	mathematical thinking are emphasized. Pupils are called to concentrate on 
	mathematics, given the fact that it represents the cornerstone of every 
	discipline. They are encouraged to appreciate the beauty and power of 
	mathematics, trained to communicate in mathematical language, and taught to 
	use different problem-solving strategies. Both teachers and parents have 
	been playing an important role in implementing this and other related 
	policies. Teachers in Singapore are known for their passion for learning and 
	applying new methods in mathematics teaching and for their strong 
	perseverance and commitment. And parents are known for their heavy 
	investment in their children’s education and collaboration with teachers.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many educators believe that the 
	curriculum Singapore uses is to be credited for its distinguished record in 
	international mathematics competition. This is true. The curriculum is not 
	only unique but also has been, changed, revised, and upgraded several times 
	since the late 1980s to ensure the inclusion of the latest techniques, 
	concepts, and technology in teaching and learning. Commenting on the 
	Singapore Primary Math book, an American educator wrote: “From the moment I 
	opened the book, I knew I found something unique and exciting. The 
	presentation of concept was clear and logically tiered as lessons moved from 
	concrete, pictorial to abstract. Each lesson progressed quickly from 
	familiar material into more difficult and unfamiliar territory and 
	challenged the student to think about math in a different way”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This, of course, differs from 
	educational systems and curriculums used in the Arab world, where ministries 
	of education’s policies are highly influenced by outdated traditions and 
	concepts, curriculums are inflexible, pupils are prevented to think 
	independently, and emphasis is on quantity rather than quality. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to findings from an 
	educational study recently conducted in Kuwait, 35 percent of teachers were 
	unqualified despite holding university degrees. More shocking, however, was 
	that more than 50 percent of pupils disliked mathematics, science and 
	English, owing to the rigid curriculum, preferring instead subjects such as 
	Islamic education. This alone explains the poor performance of Kuwaiti and 
	other Arab students in the TIMSS tests.</font></p>
