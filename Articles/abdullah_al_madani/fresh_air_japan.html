	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Following his Liberal Democratic 
	Party’s (LDP) landslide victory in the September 11 general elections, Prime 
	Minister Junichiro Koizumi has emerged as one of most powerful leaders in 
	post-war Japan. With 296 seats in the 480-member Lower House of parliament 
	and firm control of the country’s biggest party, he has become the 
	undisputed king of Japanese politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Highlighting the election’s result 
	and its consequent impact on Japan’s politics and economy, one must 
	recognize the following points: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, the result was a personal 
	victory for Koizumi, who had been earlier criticized for his decision to 
	hold a snap election. Numerous observers and politicians, including 
	prominent figures within the LDP, viewed the 63-year-old Koizumi’s decision 
	as a suicidal move. Forces opposed to Tokyo’s foreign policy of supporting 
	the US-led Iraq war, particularly in the Arab/Islamic world, were, of 
	course, happy to receive such an analysis, hoping Koizumi’s defeat would end 
	Japan’s peaceful role in Iraq. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Things, however, went against such 
	wishes and all public opinion polls. Koizumi has got the mandate he needed 
	to go ahead with his ambitious domestic reform agenda. The man, who 
	succeeded Yoshiro Mori, one of Japan’s most unpopular leaders, and whose 
	coming to power in April 2001 was described as ‘fresh air’, has now 
	overwhelming power to shape his country’s future. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite this, Koisumi, unlike his 
	Third World counterparts, has no intention to stay in office beyond 
	September 2006 when his current term as prime minister ends, saying the 
	remaining period is enough to place Japan on the reform road and to arrange 
	for a talented successor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, the result was a clear 
	triumph for the LDR, especially with the main opposition party, the 
	Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), ending up with only 113 seats, 62 seats 
	less than its pre-election standing of 175. The LDP, which has run Japan for 
	nearly all the past 50 years, is now in a position that it has not enjoyed 
	since the 1980s. And with Koisumi having strengthened his personal 
	authority, the LDP may become much stronger, given the Prime Minister’s 
	agenda of rejuvenating the party’s structures, purging its anti-reform old 
	guard, and bringing new life and blood into it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Third, one of the election’s 
	significant results was an increase in the number of female legislatures in 
	the Lower House from 34 to 43. This has been viewed as an unprecedented 
	development, given the fact that the highest previous record was 39, 
	achieved in 1946 when women were first allowed into parliament. Of the 43 
	new female lawmakers, 26 belong to the LDP, up from just 9 in the dissolved 
	Lower House, something that is attributed to Koisumi’s strategy of giving 
	female candidates preference on the LDP’s proportional representation list.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Japan still has one of the lowest 
	representations of female politicians in the industrialized world. However, 
	with the current 9 percent female representation, the country is closer to 
	the global average of 16 percent and seems to be set on the road to becoming 
	a more gender-equal democracy. Koisumi, who has so far challenged his 
	country and party’s traditions twice by giving the prestigious portfolio of 
	foreign affairs to women, is expected to include more females in both the 
	cabinet and the LDP leadership. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fourth, the LDP’s overwhelming 
	success has led to hot debates and several structural changes within the 
	opposition parties, the most notable of which was in the DPJ. Admitting 
	humiliating defeat and failure to challenge the ruling party, the DPJ’s 
	president Katsuya Okada resigned in favour of Seiji Maehara. The new 
	youthful- looking 43-year-old president my reconsider his party’s policies, 
	especially those concerning Japan-US relations. It is worth recalling that 
	one of his predecessor’s failed strategies to attract voters was lashing out 
	harshly at Koizumi for the latter’s pro- Washington foreign policy 
	concerning the Iraq issue. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fifth, the election’s results have 
	given Japan’s aging citizens new hopes for a stronger economic growth 
	capable of providing them with better security and welfare when they retire. 
	In other words, the government has now the power to pass bills on 
	privatizing the savings and insurance programmes of Japan Post, which has 
	US$ 3 trillion in deposits. This would put postal savings into more sound 
	investments rather than using them as an LDP slush fund for public works 
	projects -which is said to be sources of waste and corruption- and 
	consequently would give a boost to the country’s stagnating economy.</font></p>
