	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The current intensifying political 
	crisis in Thailand between the democratically-elected government of Prime 
	Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and opposition groups led by the Democratic 
	Party can be viewed from different angles. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, it is a reflection of the 
	controversial phenomenon of successful businessmen entering politics. Like 
	in the cases of Lebanon and Italy, where the late construction tycoon Rafik 
	Hariri and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi came to power respectively, the 
	arrival of communication tycoon Thaksin to power in Thailand has divided 
	people into two groups. One group has welcomed the development, viewing it 
	as a result of traditional politicians’ failure to efficiently lead the 
	country in a world characterized by swift economic changes and tremendous 
	development challenges. The other has perceived it as a threat to democracy, 
	human rights, public morality, and the rule of law, given businessmen’s 
	financial muscle that, presumably, can be used to buy votes, influence 
	decision-making, or violate the law. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thaksin, a former police officer, 
	successfully managed to build his business empire before entering politics 
	in the late 1990s at the helm of his Thai Rak Thai party. He carefully 
	exploited two factors to rise to power in 2001: a vacuum created by the 1997 
	economic crisis which wrecked the Democratic Party, then Thailand’s most 
	successful political party, and the new 1997 constitution which changed the 
	electoral system in ways that favoured a business-based party. Since then, 
	he has been the subject of various allegations, including corruption, abuse 
	of power, promoting political allies to top governmental posts, and 
	undermining media freedom and various checking and balancing institutions.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, the crisis is a reflection 
	of the long-standing struggle between those who support the privatization of 
	state-owned enterprises on the grounds that it would modernize and breathe 
	new life into the country’s economy and those who oppose the idea on the 
	plea that it might lead to the fall of important national assets in the 
	hands of foreigners. Privatization has been one of Thaksin’s flagship 
	policies, despite sharp criticism from opposition parties, leftists, and 
	unionists. Recently, the Supreme Administrative Court has ruled on that his 
	plans to float a 25% stake in the country’s electricity-generating monopoly 
	was a case of conflict of interest, a decision that could put on hold 
	Thaksin’s other privatization plans and open to legal challenge earlier 
	state-enterprise share offerings orchestrated by his government. This was 
	unlike a decision in February by the Constitution Court, which rejected a 
	move by some senators for Thaksin’s impeachment on the grounds of his 
	complicity in the sale of his family-owned Shin Corp to a Singaporean 
	holding company. The sale, in which the Shinawatras reaped $ 1.9 billion, 
	has been a motivation behind the emergence of the so-called people power 
	movement aimed at dislodging Thaksin from government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Third, the crisis can also be seen 
	as a traditional struggle between the urban elite who control or run most 
	public and private sectors and the rural poor who seek to have a voice.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thaksin’s electoral base is in the 
	remote rural areas, from where most of 18 million members of his party come. 
	This is said to be attributed to his policy of shrinking the gap between the 
	urban and rural economies through pushing more rural poor into business and 
	improving their lives and education. The opposition, known for not trusting 
	rural voters and denying them a voice, however, has described this as 
	vote-buying policy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fourth, the crisis also represents a 
	case in which opposition forces, instead of defeating the ruling party at 
	the polls or through constitutional tools, have resorted to undemocratic 
	means. Knowing they have no hope of contesting the April 2 snap 
	parliamentary elections that Thaksin has called for in a bid to restore his 
	popularity and mandate, the opposition parties have not only resorted to 
	anti-government rallies and demonstrations but have also decided to boycott 
	the elections. Moreover, they drew the monarchy into the current fray by 
	accusing Thaksin of disloyalty to the throne and portraying themselves as 
	defenders of the King. Such moves, of course, undermine the country’s 
	still-evolving democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With no willingness from either side 
	to negotiate a settlement, and with division and tensions escalating in the 
	society, attention is now turned towards Article 7 of the constitution, 
	which allows the King to intervene during times of national crisis. King 
	Bhumibol Adulyadej had intervened in the country’s bloody events of 1973, 
	1976, and 1992 caused by pro-democracy uprisings and military crackdowns. 
	But it is unclear how badly the current situation would have to deteriorate 
	before he felt it necessary to intervene, especially with both sides of the 
	current crisis portraying themselves as champions of democracy. </font></p>
