  <p class="articleBody">[Monday, December 16, 2002] Imagine that you're a
  psychiatrist. A new patient comes to see you and says that he regularly talks
  to an invisible being who never responds, that he reads excerpts from one
  ancient book and that he believes wholeheartedly that its contents must be
  accepted implicitly, if not taken literally.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">The patient goes on to say that that the world is only
  6,000 years old and that dinosaurs never existed. He brazenly rejects modern
  science's observations and conclusions, and subscribes to the notion that
  after death he will live in eternal bliss in some alternate dimension. And
  throughout your meeting, he keeps handing you his book and urging you to join
  him, lest you end up after death in a far less desirable alternate dimension
  than him.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Is this a mentally healthy person? If you were a
  responsible psychiatrist, how could you answer yes? These symptoms border on
  delusional schizophrenia, which the American Psychological Association's
  DSM-IV <a href="http://www.geocities.com/morrison94/psychosis.htm#Basic">describes</a>
  as involving a profound disruption in cognition and emotion, assigning unusual
  significance or meaning to normal events and holding fixed false personal
  beliefs.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">So, should you insist on follow-up appointments along
  with some strong medication? Well, quite obviously, the patient is a religious
  fundamentalist. So he would most likely not be diagnosed with a psychological
  problem. In fact, such a diagnosis could land you in hot water; the patient's
  religious beliefs are constitutionally protected.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Yet, perhaps it's time this changed, and that we made
  religious fundamentalism a mental and cultural health issue. People should be
  able to believe what they like, but only so long as their convictions don't
  harm others or, arguably, themselves. Fundamentalism, however, breeds
  fanaticism and often leads to terrible violence, injustice and inequality. If
  society can force drug addicts into rehabilitation because they're a danger to
  themselves and the public, then we should be able to compel religious
  fundamentalists to undergo treatment as well.</p>

  <a id="2002-05-21-7" href="http://www.betterhumans.com/Resources/People/person.aspx?articleID=2002-05-21-7" content="article">Richard
  Dawkins</a><!--End Helix hyperlink-->
  considers religion an opportunistic and dangerous virus of the mind. Comments
  such as these have a long history, as religion has been a particularly popular
  target in the post-Enlightenment age. Marx claimed that <b><i>religion was the
  opiate of the peopl</i></b>e. Freud claimed that it was an infantile need for
  protection in place of the parent. Ayn Rand thought that belief in God was
  demeaning to man. Nietzsche put it this way: &quot;Is man one of God's
  blunders, or is God one of man's blunders?&quot;</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Dawkins' theory has much merit. He describes religion
  as a &quot;meme,&quot; an idea that gets passed from person to person and
  generation to generation like a virus that infects hosts to reproduce its
  genes. Under this view, religion is a potent memeplex that works at a cultural
  and psychological level. Some psychologists even believe that the human brain
  is hardwired for spirituality, perhaps to help rational and intelligent
  organisms remain sane and functional while dealing with the confusions of
  existence.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Regardless, the human psyche has proven fertile ground
  for religious memes, which have evolved and withstood selective pressures over
  time and, as a result, now &quot;organize&quot; their hosts in such a way that
  institutions, including the legal system, have come to their protection.
  Evangelical memes -- such as those of Jesuits and Jehovah's Witnesses -- are
  some of the best at reproducing.</p>

  <p class="articleBody">Of course, there's nothing inherently wrong with this.
  Under memetic theory, any idea that gets reproduced is a meme. So when do
  religious memes go bad? What distinguishes fundamentalism from other types of
  religious belief systems?</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Philosopher <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/~ddennett/">Daniel
  Dennett</a>, in an essay called &quot;Protecting Public Health,&quot; provides
  some guidance. &quot;As science and technology eliminate the barriers and
  friction that have heretofore constrained our human powers and thereby limited
  the scope of our moral choice, mankind's need for a reasoned, consensual, and
  open-minded ethics will become ever more pressing,&quot; he writes. Dennett is
  concerned with the fallacies and misinformation that people cling to --
  including conspiracy theories, superstitions, mysticism, astrology and,
  especially, fundamentalism. He states, &quot;Fanaticism of every sort, on
  every issue, is bound to compete for our attention...[and] unfortunately, many
  people cling to the simple wrong answers, and are even prepared to die -- and
  kill -- for them.&quot;</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Intervening in people's thinking, however, is a
  sensitive issue, as it touches upon freedom of speech and freedom of religious
  expression. People have the right to be foolish, naive or dogmatic, just as
  they have the right to smoke cigarettes and drink too much alcohol.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">So at what point do a person's convictions become a
  health issue? In my opinion, the answer is this: A belief becomes cognitively
  unhealthy when the believer's free will and normal critical processes have
  been damaged by the belief system's dialectic. I argue that fundamentalist
  religions, insofar as they cripple a believer's ability to have free will,
  exhibit rational choice and appropriately assess the nature of the physical
  environment, have already passed this threshold.</p>

  <p class="articleBody">Moreover, the effect of fundamentalism on society is as
  detrimental as the effect of fundamentalism on believers. Fundamentalists are
  the ones who fly planes into skyscrapers and murder doctors that perform
  abortions. They are the ones who deny the existence of proven physical
  phenomena while rabidly insisting on the existence of clearly unsubstantiated
  marvels.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">They are also incapable of recognizing that they have a

  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">And historically, underdeveloped sciences, mystically
  perpetuated pseudo sciences and false assumptions about the nature of reality
  have resulted in misery and countless social injustices. The more rational the

  <!--End Helix subhead-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Of course, some beliefs and worldviews are more
  debilitating than others (both to the believer and to the society around
  them). Orthodox and literalist theologians apply a very limited worldview to
  reality, often basing their perceptions of existence on ancient texts and
  mythologies. Fundamentalist Judeo-Christians are no exception, as many still
  believe in <a href="http://www.creationism.org/">Creationism</a>, a
  6,000-year-old earth and Noah's Ark.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">But what about more moderate beliefs? What about belief
  in an immaterial soul? Or that Jesus performed miracles? Is it mentally
  unhealthy to believe such things? When do we cross the line and infringe upon
  constitutional rights?</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Ultimately, belief in the soul or Jesus's resurrection
  is not so unhealthy as to render believers dysfunctional. Some of the
  brightest and most creative contributors to society were (and are) staunch
  Christians. It was Bach, after all, who composed music for the glory of God.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Furthermore, most people in the West rarely think about
  the deeper ramifications of their existence and humanity's relationship with
  God. Sermons are no longer fire and brimstone threats but, instead, poignant
  stories about why we should love and help our neighbors -- issues that I would
  categorize as self-evident truths, and hardly the monopoly of religious
  doctrine.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Modern religions are useful in that they have taken on
  the character of moral philosophies which help followers with interpersonal
  and intrapersonal relationships. Religions form an important, if not
  essential, role in society. They offer community, existential explanations,
  compassionate and valuable moral codes and an outlet for the human need for
  spirituality. (Personally, I am agnostic, as I recognize just how sublime and
  mysterious the universe really is.)</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Also, neither modern scientism nor any other
  contemporary belief system is perfectly healthy. In fact, stubborn Western
  empiricists could learn a lot from Eastern philosophies. As Freud once said,
  &quot;It is a mistake to believe that a science consists in nothing but
  conclusively proved propositions, and it is unjust to demand that it should.
  It is a demand only made by those who feel a craving for authority in some
  form and a need to replace the religious catechism by something else, even if
  it be a scientific one.&quot;</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">The differentiating factor must be this: <b>A belief
  system is a mental disorder when it causes believers to deny the observations
  of empirical methodologies.</b> With fundamentalists, this involves denying
  the nature of the physical world as it is being presented in favour of archaic
  and unyielding irrational orthodoxies; their brains have been infected and
  debilitated with unsubstantiated nonsense.</p>

  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">Fundamentalists have been mobilized by an unconscious
  meme that seeks to protect and propagate itself at all costs, even at the

  often killing a host as they seek out transmission vectors.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">The best way to prevent a meme from gaining a
  stranglehold on a host is to prevent it from reproducing in the first place.
  With religious fundamentalism, I propose two key elements for memetic
  immunization.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">The first is responsible and accountable education and
  reporting of information to the public (including educational institutions,
  the media and the government). Children who are taught Creationism rather than
  natural selection, for example, are being primed for memetic infection. The
  second is raising the standard of living of all people. Assisting Third World
  nations would help alleviate problems of disenfranchised youths who become
  desperate and turn to religious fanaticism.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">As proof of this strategy, we need only look at how the
  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/taliban/">Taliban</a> recruited
  members: They attracted poor and uneducated boys who easily accepted radical
  Islam as an outlet for their frustrations. And without proper education they
  were unable to properly distinguish religious gibberish from fact.</p>
  <!--End Helix paragraph-->
  <!--Begin Helix paragraph-->
  <p class="articleBody">An important point needs to be made here, however:
  Killing a cultural artifact is not analogous to killing people. Culture is not
  self aware. Irrational fundamentalists should be treated as we treat others
  suffering from psychological ailments and offered immediate help. We should
  see them as suffering from a disease and help them to accept a more moderate
  religious stance and develop a more balanced life.</p>
