  <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com">www.mukto-mona.com</a>&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I mentioned about a challenge of mine (made
  couple of years ago) in <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/super_scientific_scriptures.html">one
  of my recently published&nbsp;article</a> (regarding one of those so-called
  scientific miracles in holy Qur’an). I see this has created some turmoil
  over the Net recently. My challenge has a little history. Let me tell you this
  briefly. Over the last decade, a growing numbers of Muslims have declared the<i>
  Qur'an</i> to be a book filled with alleged scientific miracles. Many educated
  Bangladeshi Muslims&nbsp;in blithely discovered ‘Big-Bang’, ‘expansion
  of the universe’, ‘theory of evolution of human species’, science of
  ‘atoms and molecules’, ‘milky-way, ‘constellation’, ‘white
  dwarf’, ‘black-holes, ‘embryology’, ‘theory of relativity’,
  ‘theory of super string’... and what not in their holly scripture (<i>Qur’an</i>).
  Numerous web sites, books and videos have been produced that proclaim Islam to
  be truly a religion of divine origin having perfect compatibility&nbsp;with
  modern science. Even though Muslim world today is thousand miles behind
  compared to the scientific development done by Jews/Christian, they
  ridiculously claim&nbsp;through their inspiring discoveries that their holy
  book is indeed ‘super scientific'! But our common sense suggests that the&nbsp;ancient
  religious scriptures of all prevalent religions were composed at a time when
  the humanity had a very limited understanding of scientific knowledge. One
  cannot legitimately expect to find the complex theories of ‘Big-Bang’,
  Super String, Relativity of Einstein etc. in the pages of those outdated Holy
  Books. In reality, the contents of those primitive books reflected the sheer
  backwardness prevalent in the contemporary society; their thoughts, belief,
  hopes and despair; nothing more nothing less. Let me illustrate with an
  example: when the holy <i>Qur’an</i> was composed, the eminent scientists
  like Galileo, Bruno, Copernicus et.al were not even born. How could the people
  of that primeval period even think of an earth, revolving around our sun?&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Obviously they could never comprehend this, as
  they were familiar only with the sun rising in the east and then setting in
  the west; the rising of the moon at the onset of night. These are the
  phenomena they have observed since their birth. God controls these heavenly
  objects, they thought. That certain laws of physics govern the progress of
  these celestial bodies, they could never comprehend. This is what is
  accurately reflected in many verses of the <i>Qur’an</i>, <i>Hadis</i>, <i>Vedas</i>
  and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bible</i>. Consider this verse
  from <i>Sura Luqman</i> <i>(31:29) </i>from the holy <i>Qur’an </i>:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">PICKTHAL: Hast thou not seen
  how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and causeth the day to pass
  into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the moon (to do their work), each
  running unto an appointed term; and that Allah is Informed of what ye do?</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">In this verse <i>Allah</i> clearly says that he
  is the one who converts the day into night and vice versa; subjected the sun
  and the moon to follow a fixed orbit. We find many similar verses elsewhere in
  the <i>Qur’an</i> as well. Here are a few samples: <i>Sura Ya-Sin</i> <i>(36:38),</i>
  <st1:place>
  <st1:City>
  <i>Sura</i></st1:City>
  <st1:State>
  <i>Az</i></st1:State>
  </st1:place>
  <i>-Zumar</i> <i>(39:5),</i> Sura <i>Al-Rad</i> (<i>13:2</i>), Sura <i>Al-Anbiya</i>
  <i>(</i> <st1:time Minute="33" Hour="21">
  <i>21:33</i></st1:time>
  <i>),</i> <i>Sura Al-Baqara</i> <i>(2:258),</i> <i>Sura Al-Kahf</i> <i>(18:86),</i>
  <i>Sura Ta-Ha</i> <i>(20:130),</i> just to name a few. However, even a
  thorough, painstaking search of the entire <i>Qur’an</i> does not show a
  single verse anywhere in it that supports the scientific reality of the
  rotation of earth. According to Allah, the earth is motionless, completely
  static. Period.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">In <i>Sura An-Naml (27:61)</i> it is stated
  clearly:&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed
  abode, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein,
  and hath set a barrier between the two seas? Is there any Allah beside Allah?
  Nay, but most of them know not!</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">In the same vein, <i>Sura Al-Rum (30:25),</i> <i>Sura
  Fatir</i> <i>(35:41),</i> <i>Sura Luqman</i> <i>(31:10),</i> <i>Sura Al-Baqara</i>
  <i>(</i> <st1:time Minute="22" Hour="14">
  <i>2:22</i></st1:time>
  <i>),</i> <i>Sura An-Nahl</i> <i>(</i> <st1:time Minute="15" Hour="16">
  <i>16:15</i></st1:time>
  <i>) </i>exhorts the <i>Allah’s</i> decree that the earth is completely
  immovable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Since the Islamic scholars are absolutely
  certain that the <i>Qur’an</i> contains all the scientific principles, with
  due respect, I earnestly requested them <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">to show me a verse, just a single verse in the <i>Qur’an</i> that states
  that the <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">earth moves round the sun</i></b>;
  or that the <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">'earth rotates'</i></b>
  at the least.<b>&nbsp;</b></span> The Arabic word for earth is ‘<i>Ard</i>’
  and the Arabic word for rotation is ‘<i>Falak</i>’. If someone could show
  me just a single verse in the <i>Qur’an</i> that uses the two words ‘<i>Ard</i>’
  and ‘<i>Falak</i>’ side by side’,&nbsp;I would accept my defeat.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Since then no scholar could show me a single
  verse to that effect.&nbsp;One author (Osama Abdallah)&nbsp;in his website (<span style="font-family:Arial"><a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">www.answering-christianity.com</span></a></span>)&nbsp;tried

  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[Osama Abdallah]</b></p>

  <p style="text-align:justify">I must admit that I could not fathom author's

  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Well, there are plenty of verses in Qur’an
  that depict that the movement of the sun; and again there are few of verses
  that clearly represent that earth is fixed (unmovable). It is not hard to
  reach the logical conclusion if one really wishes too. Let's see how

  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Well, without being biased nor try to answer
  away any error in Islam, but the Bible and the Pagan Gita, the Mohabharat and
  the Vedas clearly and DIRECTLY claim that the earth doesn't move and that the
  sun rotates around it:&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">From the Bible: &quot;He set the earth on its
  foundations; it can never be moved. (From the NIV Bible, Psalm 104:5)&quot;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">However, no where in the Noble Qur’an or any
  Saying (Hadith) from Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him do you see a straight
  forward and DIRECT claim about the sun rotating around the earth and that the
  earth doesn't move.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My Response]&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Muslim apologists are fond of claiming that ONLY
  the Qur’an miraculously predicted the findings of modern science, and that
  all of its factual scientific claims are flawless whereas other scriptures are
  all nonsense. I reject the Qur’an like any other religious scriptures,&nbsp;only
  because it&nbsp;is fallible, primitive work of a bygone age, and&nbsp;inappropriate
  for our times. Please take a look on the two verses from Bible and Qur’an:</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Bible-</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">&quot;He set the <b>earth on
  its foundations</b>; <b>it can never be moved.</b> (From the NIV Bible, Psalm
  104:5)&quot;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">And Qur’an -</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">Is not He (best) Who made the <b>earth
  a fixed abode</b>, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm
  hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas? Is there any Allah
  beside Allah? Nay, but most of them know not! <i>An-Naml (27:61)</i></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I did not find much difference between these
  two. Both emphasizes that the earth is fixed and motionless. To be frank a
  humanly-written text would be expected to reflect the state of such knowledge
  as it stood during its time. But while Bible focuses the &quot;earth can never
  be moved&quot; it appears to OA that the earth is indeed motionless and thus
  completely unscientific, but in the breath, while Qur’an says in the exactly
  similar way, &quot;Who made the earth a fixed abode..&quot;, it does not
  appear to them as the same motionless earth.&nbsp;This kind of thinking of
  course satisfies only a Muslim apologist but no rational person will give any
  importance to it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The Qur’an is unashamedly of its time.
  According to Qur’an our Earth is flat and both the sun and the moon run
  across it. They are “lamps” hanging from the ceiling of the sky that is
  being supported by invisible columns. The Quranic solar system also contains
  invisible genies. They climb over each other’s shoulders and reach the
  heaven to eavesdrop the conversation of the “Exalted Assembly”. The stars
  are used as missiles (shooting stars) to hit them (genies). The moon is
  supposed to be above the stars. Then sun also must rise from muddy waters and
  enter in the murky waters just as Zul Qaranain witnessed (sura: 18:86, 18:90).
  There is also a position for <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/allahs_throne.htm">the
  throne of Allah</a>. But the throne is over the waters and the Sun has to
  prostrate in front of the throne and ask permission of Allah to rise. If you
  want to sell these non-sense as &quot;scientific&quot;, I have nothing much to
  say.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I want to comment on the translation &quot;The
  earth like a carpet Spread out&quot;, which is &quot;Al-ard MAHDA&quot;.
  &quot;Al-ard&quot; means &quot;the earth&quot; and &quot;mahda&quot; means
  &quot;to straighten&quot; or &quot;to make straight&quot;, or &quot;to comfort
  (as in mahdi, the comfortor)&quot; or &quot;alleviate&quot;. For instance,
  When workers build streets, they comfort (mahd) or alleviate the land for us
  to be able to drive our cars on it. Again, the Noble <b>Verse doesn't suggest
  that the earth is flat</b>. It says that Allah Almighty alleviated the land
  for us &quot;to go about therein by roads&quot;.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">If we have any doubt about what Allah really
  thought of the shape of the Earth, we can read the following verse carefully:&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:

  78: 6</a><i>&nbsp;<br>

  Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse,...</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The “expanse” gives an idea of something
  flat. The Arabic word used in the Qur’an is Mehad, (bed). All the beds that
  I have seen so far were flat. None of them were spherical. I have never seen
  any spherical carpet also :-)</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The author also quoted the verse 79:30 which,
  according to him it is stated that the Earth is egg shape. The author
  suggested Eggs are spherical so as earth.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">But the author is completely wrong in two ways.
  First, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">our earth is not egg-shape</b>.
  Our earth’s shape can be described as an oblate spheroid, more like orange&nbsp;–
  slightly flattened at the poles and slightly bulging at the equator shape.
  Even school going children know these facts. And secondly the term
  &quot;egg-shape&quot; is also a unique invention of Muslim apologists, I must
  say. The verse (79:30) actually does not&nbsp;deal with egg. &nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The transliteration of the above verse:&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><i>Wa<b>a</b>l-ar<u>d</u>a baAAda <u>tha</u>lika
  da<u>ha</u>h<u>a</u></i></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">It means (word by word):</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">And the Earth after that was spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Here I quote the three famous translations.
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><i>079.030</i>&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  YUSUFALI: And the earth, moreover, hath He extended (to a wide expanse);&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  PICKTHAL: And after that He spread the earth,&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  SHAKIR: And the earth, He expanded it after that.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Dahaha is not egg. Egg in Arabic is “al baiza”.
  That is why the above three translators did not put any egg inside.&nbsp; I
  have confirmed it with many Arabic-speaking people. I also once e-mailed to
  Dr. Ali Sina, the founder of FFI. He also confirmed that&nbsp;the translation
  of the above verse by three most reliable interpreters is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The following article clearly explains the above
  Noble Verses, especially Noble Verse 21:33.&nbsp; It shows how early Muslim
  scholars all agreed that the Earth was round.&nbsp; It is only the later
  Muslim scholars in the 1500s that deviated from this belief.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The following section was taken from <span style="font-family:Arial"><a href="http://www.thetruereligion.org/earth.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">http://www.thetruereligion.org/earth.htm</span></a></span>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">That article tried to use <b>Ibn Taymeyya</b> as
  a reliable reference who thought &quot;<span style="font-family:Arial"><a href="http://www.apostatesofislam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=70" target="_blank"><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Chemistry
  is Evil Magic</span></b></a></span>&quot;. I like to leave it to the readers
  to judge&nbsp;how much reliable Taymeyya's resource is in our scientific
  debate.&nbsp;Some people indeed dig their own grave!</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Anyway, let's come to the point directly. The
  verse <st1:time Hour="21" Minute="33">
  21:33</st1:time>
  in that article does not even mention about earth, let alone about its
  roundness or flatness. Here is the exact translation:&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">PICKTHAL: And He it is Who created the night and
  the day, and the <b><u>sun</u></b> and the <b><u>moon</u></b>. They float,
  each in an orbit.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The verse under discussion talks only about the
  movement of sun and moon. There is no mention of earth; neither directly nor
  indirectly. I would like to request the author to refrain himself from
  twisting the fact. The author (OA) has mentioned the same verse in some other
  places in his article to &quot;prove&quot; earth's rotation. I will explain
  the inaccuracy,&nbsp;falsehood and deception of the explanation more
  elaborately on that occasion.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Actually what Mr. Avijit Roy doesn't see in
  these Noble Verses and in Geology is that it's been scientifically proven that
  the mountains and the hills do actually help the earth to stay balanced during
  it's rotation around itself.&nbsp;If we didn't have those mountains and hills,
  the earth would be in a constant shake because of the high speed in rotation.&nbsp;</p>

  amazing creation of earth and mountains in the Noble Qur’an.</span></a></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I think this “mountain story for&nbsp;stabilizing
  earth from shaking” is perhaps one of the lies of <span style="font-family:
Arial"><a href="http://answering-islam.org/Campbell/bucaille.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Dr.
  Maurice Bucaille</span></a></span>&nbsp;revealed in his (in)famous book
  -&quot;The Bible, the Qur'an and Science&quot;, which is comprehensively
  refuted by <span style="font-family:Arial"><a target="_blank" href="http://answering-islam.org.uk/Campbell/index.html"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Dr.
  William Campbell</span></a></span> in his &quot;The Qur'an and the Bible in
  the Light of History &amp; Science&quot;.&nbsp;Commenting on author's
  statement, &quot;If we didn't have those mountains and hills, the earth would
  be in a constant shake because of the high speed in rotation.&quot;, I would
  quote Professor of Geology, Dr. David A. Young - &quot;While it is true that
  many mountain ranges are composed of folded rocks (and the folds may be of
  large scale) <b>it is not true that the folds render the crust stable</b>. The
  very existence of the folds is evidence of instability in the crust.&quot; In
  other words, <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mountains don't keep the
  earth from shaking.</i></b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <b>Their
  formation caused and still causes the surface of the earth to shake</b></i>.
  But the ancient Arab people did not have that much knowledge to know the
  correct reason.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Secondly, consider the earthquake zones of earth. Earthquakes happen 'all the
  time' and they are concentrated along specific zones, in which mountainous
  areas are also concentrated. Therefore, claims that mountains are firm and
  immovable, and that <span style="font-family:Arial"><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7226" target="_blank"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">mountains
  prevent the earth from shaking are in-correct &amp; un-scientific</span></a></span>.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Lastly, citing the mountains as
  &quot;immovable&quot; in some Quranic verses (015.019, 027.061 etc) also
  deserve severe criticism. The mountains are part of a continental plate which
  is moving and&nbsp;are attached to a rotating (moving) Earth; The Earth itself
  is revolving about the Sun; Sun and its planets are revolving about our Milky
  Way galaxy; The Milky Way galaxy is again moving around the center of the
  Local Group of Galaxies.... etc. So mountains cannot be considered as
  &quot;immoveable&quot; as the whole universe is moving. So if I were God, I
  would write the verse in a following way (thanks to <b>Farside)</b>:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify"><b>015.019</b> And the earth We
  have spread out (like a carpet); set thereon mountains firm and <b>moving
  through the cosmic void.&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">How about that?&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b>&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Here the rising and the setting of the sun have nothing to do with the earth's
  or the sun's rotations, nor does it say that there is a hole in the earth that
  the sun sets in.&nbsp;In Noble Verses 18:86 and 90, it was talking about the
  morning and the evening times, and in Noble Verse 20:130, Muslims are
  commanded to praise and glorify Allah Almighty before dawn and after sun set.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Even today we still use phrases like &quot;sun
  rise&quot; and &quot;sun set&quot;, despite the fact that we know that the
  earth rotates around the sun.&nbsp; The Noble Verses above do not make any
  DIRECT claim about the sun rotating around the earth, nor do they suggest that
  the sun rises from a hole and sets in another hole on earth.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">The Qur'an states:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">Until when he reached the
  setting of the Sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water. Near it he
  found a People. We said: &quot;O Zul-qarnain! (Thou hast authority,) either to
  punish them or to treat them with kindness.&quot; (Q. 18:86)</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Does the above verse speak of the Sun setting or
  does it <b>speak of the place where the Sun sets</b>? If the above verse
  speaks about seeing the Sun setting and no more, we have to ask, &quot;But the
  Sun rises every day and on every nation. Why was that day and that place
  singled out in the life of Zul-Qarnain to be described in the words 'Until
  when he reached the setting of the Sun, he found it sets in a spring of murky
  water. Near it he found a People.&quot;? The only sense we can make out of the
  Qur'anic verse is that after so many sunrises and so many sunsets Zul-Qarnain
  finally &quot;reached the setting of the Sun&quot; and he found that &quot;it
  set in a spring of murky water&quot; near which he found a People.&quot;</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">If all that Zul-Qarnain experienced was a daily
  sunrise and a daily sunset, why was he singled out by the Qur'an as the person
  who reached both the place of the rising and setting of the Sun? Zul-Qarnain
  is not the only person who saw the sun rise and set, we have all had this
  experience. The only sense that could be made of these verses is that
  Zul-Qarnain alone had this unique experience of reaching the place of the
  sunrise and the sunset.

  <p style="text-align:justify">If the above verses only depict &quot;sun
  rise&quot; and &quot;sun set&quot; that is being used in our normal daily
  life, then what is so &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;miraculous&quot; about
  the book? Anyone have no or minimal scientific knowledge can come up with such
  &quot;miraculous&quot; hocus-pocus.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[OA]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Allah Almighty claims in the Noble Qur’an that
  life originated from water.&nbsp; He created every living creature from water.&nbsp;
  So when earth was originally a body of water and then Allah Almighty created
  land and creatures from it which by the way it's been scientifically proven to
  be true , then Allah Almighty's claim about Him making the earth
  &quot;firm&quot; in Noble Verse 27:61 is true.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>[My response]</b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Indeed Noble Qur’an has many noble inventions.
  Qur’an ambiguously asserts many common-sensually meaningless statements
  about such an elementary matter of formation of life. For examples sometimes
  it tells that we are created from earth (11:61), sometimes it claims from dry
  clay (15:26,28,33, 17:61, 32:7), sometimes &quot;from nothing&quot; (19:67),
  sometimes &quot;NOT from nothing&quot; (52:35), sometimes from wet earth
  (23:12), or from mire (38:71), sometimes from water (25:54, 21:30, 24:45),
  sometimes from dust (3:59, 30:20, 35:11) or even sometimes from dead (30:19,
  39:6). So which one is true? Those contradictory and ambiguous statements
  actually do not reveal any scientific facts regarding either how we created or
  what exactly we are made of.

  <p style="text-align:justify">If one&nbsp;thinks Qur’an is unique based on
  foretelling life originated from water, s/he is&nbsp;dead wrong! Hindu
  Religious book Veda' (8000 B. C.) described origin of Earth and life from
  WATER of the SEA long before Qur’an came in picture with such assertion. The
  Great Greek Philosopher and Scientist THALES (640-546 B. C.) was the first
  Humankind who theorized that, everything in this Universe was created from
  WATER OF THE SEA. Problem was, Thales could not provide any scientific proof.
  After that, ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C. the pupil of Plato and Tutor of Alexander
  the Great) concluded: &quot;Because of the fact that, Plants &amp; Animal body
  contains plenty of WATER and life needs WATER that was why THALES thought
  WATER WAS THE ORIGIN OF LIFE&quot;. Therefore, Mankind did not have to wait
  until 7th Century for Allah to say importance of WATER for life. You can check

  in one Noble Verse. He certainly used the words &quot;falak&quot; and
  &quot;all (celestial bodies)&quot; in one Noble Verse, but never &quot;earth (ard)&quot;
  and &quot;falak&quot;:</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Dear Readers, please enlighten me - where is the
  mention of &quot;earth&quot; in that verse? I didn't find any other celestial
  bodies except sun and moon. But&nbsp;like other Muslim apologists the author
  OA&nbsp;&quot;miraculously&quot;&nbsp;figured out the movement of the earth in
  that verse. Keeping aside our emotion and blind belief, let's judge with a
  free mind how much accurate the claim is.&nbsp;Readers might have noticed
  (check Arabic Transliteration again) that an a word &quot;<b>Kullun</b>&quot;
  is used in this verse. The meaning of the word is all, both, each or every.
  The word can be used as singular or plural. In the above mentioned verse
  &quot;Kullun&quot; has been used just after sun and moon. So the translation
  of &quot;wa<b>a</b>lqamara<u> kullun</u> fee<u> falak</u>in yasba<u>h</u>oon<b>a</b>&quot;
  stands as - &quot;all&nbsp;swim along, each in its rounded course&quot;. In
  this sentence &quot;all&quot; indicates only towards sun and moon, nothing
  else. Some Bucaille lovers are coming with an assertion that &quot;all&quot;
  indicates the &quot;all celestial bodies&quot; of the universe. I have no
  objection in accepting that all celestial bodies of the universe are moving,
  but does the above-mentioned verse resembles the fact? It will clarify our
  confusion if we discuss on a similar type of sentences as stated below:</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Joe and Jim came to my house yesterday. <span style="color:red">They</span>
  (<span style="color:red">all / each</span>) are good students.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">An infant too will understand that here the word
  They/all/each&nbsp;is pointing towards Joe and Jim only. But if one
  interpreter comes with an interpretation saying that the sentence is actually
  indicating Joe, Jim, John, Jack, Lisa, Ram, Rahim&nbsp;all -&nbsp;I wonder
  whether it will be an honest interpretation. This hypocrisy they understand
  quite easily for Joe and Jim, but in case of Qur’an they all are suffused
  with great mystic wonders and astonish. To avoid such misinterpretation, some
  translator used &quot;both&quot; to indicate sun and moon in their
  translation. For example, our Bengali Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi translated the
  verse as &quot;<span style="color:red">Both</span> (sun and moon) float, each
  in its rounded course”. Pickthal also translated as -&quot;<span style="color:red">They</span>
  float, each in an orbit&quot; It is quite clear that &quot;They&quot;
  indicates sun and moon, nothing else. It is to be noted that the word &quot;kullun&quot;
  has been used not only in Sura <i>Al-Anbiya</i>, but also in <i>Ya-Sin</i> <i>,</i>
  <st1:place>
  <st1:City>
  <i>Sura</i></st1:City>
  <st1:State>
  <i>Az</i></st1:State>
  </st1:place>
  <i>-Zumar,</i> Sura <i>Al-Rad</i>,&nbsp; <i>Sura Fatir and&nbsp; Sura Luqman</i>.
  For each and every case, it has been used after Sun and moon, nowhere after
  the earth. For example, let's dig out now how &quot;wakullun fee falakin yasba<u>h</u>oon<b>a</b>&quot;&nbsp;has&nbsp;been
  used in <i>Ya-Sin:</i></p>
  <p style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">L<u>a</u> a<b>l</b>shshamsu
