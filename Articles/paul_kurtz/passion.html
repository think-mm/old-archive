    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>The Culture War</strong></font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Passion of the Christ is not
    simply a movie but a political club; at least it is being so used against
    secularists by leading conservative Christians. TV pundit Bill O’Reilly
    clearly understands that Mel Gibson’s film is a weapon in the cultural war
    now being waged in America between traditional religionists and secular
    protagonists—such as the New York Times, Frank Rich, Andy Rooney, and the
    predominant “cultural elite.” Newt Gingrich chortled that the movie may
    be “the most important cultural event” of the century. James Dobson of
    Focus on the Family and a bevy of preachers herald it as “the greatest
    film ever made.” Busloads of devoted churchgoers were brought daily to
    view the film, which portrays the arrest, trial, crucifixion, and death of
    Jesus with graphic brutality. It is used to stir sympathy for Jesus, who,
    half naked, suffers violent sadomasochistic whippings at the hands of his
    persecutors; and it has engendered hostility to Jews, secularists, and
    separationists who have dared to question Gibson’s allegedly scripturally
    accurate account.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Passion of the Christ reinforces a
    reality secularists dare not overlook: more than ever before, the Bible has
    become a powerful political force in America. The Religious Right is pulling
    no punches in order to defeat secularism and, it hopes, transform the United
    States into a God-fearing country that salutes “one nation under God”
    and opposes gay marriages and the “liberal agenda.” The interjection of
    religion into the public square (in fact, it was never empty) by powerful
    religious and political forces has ominous implications. James Madison,
    framer of the Constitution, rightfully worried about factions disrupting
    civil society, and religious factions can be the most fractious.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Director Mel Gibson's film portrays
    the arrest, trial, crucifixion, and death of Jesus with graphic brutality.&nbsp;
    It stirs sympathy for Jesus, who, half naked, suffers violent
    sadomasochistic whippings at the hands of his persecutors; it has engendered
    hostility to Jews, secularists, and separationists who have dared to
    question Gibson's allegedly scripturally accurate account.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Movies are a powerful medium. Film
    series including Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Trek,
    The Terminator, and The Matrix all draw upon fantasy; and these have proved
    to be highly entertaining, captivating, and huge box office hits. The
    Passion of the Christ, however, is more than that, for it lays down a
    gauntlet challenging basic democratic secular values. It also presents
    fantasy as fact, and for the unaware and the credulous, this is more than an
    exercise in poetic license; it is artistic and historical dishonesty.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>A Distorted Version of the
    Bible</strong></font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Gibson has claimed that his film&nbsp;
    is “a true and faithful rendition of the Gospels.” This is hardly the
    case. On numerous occasions, Passion presents extra-biblical material that
    distorts the biblical account. Gibson uses poetic license with abandon.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Commentators have pointed out that
    Gibson distorts the character of Pontius Pilate, making him seem to be a
    tolerant, benevolent, and fair-minded judge—when independent non-Christian
    historical texts indicate that he was a mean-spirited political opportunist.
    The film also portrays Pilate’s wife, Claudia, as a kind of heroine. She
    is sympathetic to Jesus and thinks his punishment is unjust; there is some
    textual basis for that in the Bible. But Gibson goes beyond this in his
    portrayal; at one point in the film, Claudia acts kindly toward Mary and
    Mary Magdalene, approaching them with a gift of linen cloths. Gibson has
    Mary use them to wipe pools of blood from the spot where Jesus was flogged
    by the Romans. Nowhere are these scenes found in any of the four Gospels.
    Church historian Elaine Pagels has said that it is “unthinkable” that
    Jewish women would have sought or received any sympathy or succor from the
    Romans.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Nor do the Gospels provide any support
    for the severe beatings&nbsp; Jesus receives from the Jewish soldiers and
    guards who arrest him in the Garden of Gethsemane prior to those inflicted
    by the Romans. In one gruesome scene, as Jewish troops bring Jesus back to
    Jerusalem heavily bound, they constantly beat him and at one point, even
    throw him off a bridge. There is no account of this in the Gospels. It is
    tossed in to underscore the brutality of the captors.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">All the Gospels say is that a
    large crowd sent by the priests came to the garden to arrest Jesus. There
    was a scuffle and Jesus told his disciples to lay down their swords. (Here
    as elsewhere, Jesus does not seem to be a part of his own cultural and
    religious Jewish milieu; both he and his followers are consistently
    characterized as renegades and “other” than their social environment.)
    Matthew 26:57 states: “Jesus was led off under arrest to the house of
    Caiaphas the High Priest.” Mark 14:53 reads: “Then they led Jesus away
    to the High Priest’s house.” Luke 22:54: “Then they arrested Him and
    led Him away.” John’s version in 18:12: “The troops with the</font>ir
    commander and the Jewish police, now arrested Him and secured Him. They took
    Him first to Annas... the father-in-law of Caiaphas.”1</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Yet in one gruesome scene, as Jewish
    troops bring Jesus back to Jerusalem, heavily bound and subject to continual
    beating, they throw him off a bridge.&nbsp; There is no account of this in
    the Gospels.&nbsp; It is tossed in to underscore the brutality of the
    captors.&nbsp;</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If Jesus’ abuse by the Jewish guards
    did not come from the Scriptures, where did Gibson borrow it? It comes from
    the supposed revelations of a Catholic nun and mystic, Anne Catherine
    Emmerich. Indeed, much of Passion is taken from Emmerich’s book first
    published in 1833, known in English as The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord
    Jesus Christ. The current edition proudly asserts on its jacket that it is
    “the classic account of Divine Revelation that inspired” the Mel Gibson
    motion picture.2</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Emmerich, a passionate devotee of the
    practice of meditating on the “sacred wounds of Jesus,” describes in the
    book how,&nbsp; after Jesus was arrested, he was tightly bound, constantly
    struck, dragged, and made to walk with bare feet on jagged rocks. Let us
    focus on a bridge, which they soon reached, and which Gibson depicts in the
    film. Emmerich states, “I saw our Lord fall twice before He reached the
    bridge, and these falls were caused entirely by the barbarous manner in
    which the soldiers dragged Him; but when they were half over the bridge they
    gave full vent to their brutal inclinations, and struck Jesus with such
    violence that they threw Him off the bridge into the water.... If God had
    not preserved Him, He must have been killed by this fall” (p. 71).</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I refer here to this scene only to
    show that Gibson went far beyond the texts of the Gospels and inserted
    nonscriptural events mostly drawn from Emmerich. Remember that these are the
    subjective visions of a psychic-mystic rendered more than&nbsp; 1, 800 years
    after the events they concern. I went to see the movie a second time to see
    if any credit line is given to the Emmerich book at the end of the film. I
    could find none, a glaring omission.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A good deal of the focus of The
    Passion of the Christ is on the flogging (scourging) of Jesus. Two Gospels
    state simply that Pilate “had Jesus flogged and handed over to be
    crucified” (Matthew 27:26, Mark 15:15). John’s description agrees
    (19:1-2): “Pilate now took Jesus and had Him flogged.” Luke’s account
    (23:16) has Pilate saying: “I therefore propose to let Him off with a
    flogging.”</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What the Gospels state
    matter-of-factly and without narrative elaboration is luridly expanded by
    Emmerich: First they used “a species of thorny stick covered with knots
    and splinters. The blows from these sticks tore His flesh to pieces; his
    blood spouted out...” (p. 135). Then she describes the use of scourges
    “composed of small chains, or straps covered with iron hooks, which
    penetrated to the bone and tore off large pieces of flesh at every blow”
    (p. 135). Moreover, nowhere do the Gospels describe who watched the
    flogging. Emmerich states that “a Jewish mob gathered at a distance.”
    Gibson has the high priests watching the brutal flogging (while a feminine
    incarnation of Satan looks on with them). Nowhere is this described in the
    Bible. Gibson thus goes far beyond the New Testament account, implying that
    the Jews and their leaders were complicit in the brutal beatings of Jesus.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The New Testament account next states
    that the high priests and crowd in the square before Pilate called for the
    crucifixion of Jesus, and when given the choice, selected Barrabas to be
    freed over Jesus. This is fully depicted in Gibson’s Passion.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The film, however, is silent about the
    fact that Jesus, his mother Mary, Peter, James, and the other disciples as
    well as the supporters in the crowds were themselves Jews. In Emmerich and
    Gibson the Jews come off as the main enemies of Jesus, provoking the Romans
    not only to crucify him, but to torture him and inflict maximum suffering. I
    think the point in the film is even more anti-Jewish: it’s that Pilate
    tries to placate the Jews with the beatings, but they won’t be
    satisfied—some real blood thirstiness here!</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Is The Passion of the Christ
    anti-Semitic? Yes, flagrantly so, in my judgment. The Passion repeats the
    description of the Jews portrayed in medieval art and Passion Plays, which
    provoked in no small measure anti-Semitic pogroms and persecutions suffered
    by the “Christ killers” for centuries. Much has been said about the fact
    that Mel Gibson’s eighty-five-year-old father, Hutton Gibson, is a
    Holocaust denier. He has been quoted as saying that Vatican II was “a
    Mason plot backed by the Jews.” Mel Gibson removed from the subtitles of
    the original version of his film the statement from Matthew (27:25-26):
    “The blood be on us, and on our children,” though apparently it remains
    in the spoken Aramaic text.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">To his credit, Pope John Paul II in
    2000 made an historic apology, declaring that the Jews of today cannot be
    held responsible for the death of Christ. Still, The Passion debuts at a
    time when anti-Semitism is growing worldwide, especially in Europe and
    throughout the Islamic world.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">According to scripture (especially the
    Gospel of John), Christ died on the cross because God sent His only begotten
    Son to die for our sins; thus, all sinners are responsible, not simply the
    Jews of ancient Israel. Mel Gibson has himself blamed all sinners for the
    crucifixion. If this is the case, the crucifixion of Christ had to happen,
    and was for that matter foretold by Him. Why God was willing to allow His
    only beloved Son to suffer a horrible death is difficult to fathom, but
    according to Christian apologetics it was preordained so that those who
    believed in Christ could be saved. Thus it was God—not the Jews alone or
    the Romans—who was responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus. One might
    even say that if this was part of a divine plan, the Jews should get the
    credit for carrying it out.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>Is the Biblical Account
    Reliable?</strong></font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Is the account of Jesus as described
    in the New Testament—in this case of his trial, crucifixion, and death
    (let alone his birth, ministry, and resurrection) – an accurate account of
    historical events? I doubt it. This negative appraisal is drawn from
    careful, scholarly, and scientific examination of the New Testament account.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The key point is the fact that the
    authors of the Gospels were not themselves eyewitnesses to the events
    described in those documents. If Jesus died about the year 30 C.E. (this is
    conjectural, since some even question whether he ever lived3), the Gospel
    according to Mark was probably written in the 70s of the first century;
    Matthew and Luke in the 80s; and John anywhere from 90 to 100 C.E. They were
    thus written some forty to seventy years after the death of Jesus. The
    Gospels are based on an oral tradition, derived at best from second- and
    third-hand testimony assembled by the early band of Jewish Christians and
    including anecdotal accounts, ill-attributed sayings, stories, and parables.
    The Gospels’ claims are not independently corroborated by impartial
    observers—all the more reason why some skepticism about their factual
    truth is required. They were not written as history or biography per
    se—and the authors did not use the methods of careful, historical
    scholarship. Rather, they were, according to biblical scholar Randel Helms,
    written by missionary propagandists for the faith, interested in proclaiming
    the “good news” and in endeavoring to attract and convert others to
    Christianity.4 Hence, the Gospels should not be taken as literally true, but
    are a form of special pleading for a new ideological-moral-theological
    faith.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In writing the Gospels the authors
    evidently looked back to the Old Testament and found passages that were
    suggestive of a Messiah who would appear, who was born of a young woman (or
    a virgin), and could trace his lineage back to David—which is why Matthew
    and Luke made such a fuss about having Jesus born in Bethlehem. Accordingly,
    the Gospels should be read as works of literary art, spun out of the
    creative imagination in order to fulfill passionate yearnings for salvation.
    They are the most influential form of fiction that has dominated Western
    culture throughout its history. Whether there is any core of truth to them
    is questionable; for it is difficult to verify the actual facts,
    particularly since there is no mention of Jesus or of his miraculous
    healings in any extant non-Christian literature.5</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tradition has it that Mark heard about
    Jesus from Peter. Eusebius (260-339 C.E.) is one source for this claim, but
    Eusebius wrote some three centuries after the death of Jesus. In any case,
    Matthew and Luke most likely base their accounts on Mark.6 The three
    synoptic Gospels are similar, though they contradict each other on a number
    of significant events. Scholars believe that some of these were derived from
    still another literary source (Q, for quelle in German, or “source”)
    that has been lost.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Another historical fact to bear in
    mind is that the Gospels were written after a protracted war between the
    Romans and the Jews (66-74 C.E.), which saw the destruction of Jerusalem and
    of the Temple (70 C.E.). Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed in these
    wars and were dispersed throughout the Mediterranean world. Jerusalem was
    eventually leveled in 135 C.E. The synoptic Gospels were influenced by the
    political conditions at the times of the various authors who wrote the
    Gospels, not during the years of Jesus. John’s Gospel, written somewhat
    later, reflected the continuing growth of Christianity in his day. The other
    book attributed to John, Revelations, which is so influential today,
    predicts the apocalyptic end of the world, the Rapture, and the Second
    Coming of Jesus. This book in the view of many scholars reflects the
    ruminations of a disturbed personality. We have no reliable evidence that
    these events will occur in the future, yet hundreds of millions of people
    today are convinced that they will – on the basis of sheer faith.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Let us consider another part of the
    historical context in the latter part of the first century, when most of the
    New Testament was composed. Two Jewish sects contended for dominance. First
    was Rabbinic Judaism, which followed the Torah with all its commandments and
    rituals (including circumcision and dietary laws). Drawing on the Old
    Testament, Rabbinic Judaism held that the Jews were the “chosen people.”
    Once slaves in Egypt, they had escaped to the Promised Land of Palestine.
    Someday after the Diaspora the Jews would be returned to Israel, and the
    Temple would be rebuilt. The second sect was early Jewish Christianity,
    which attempted to appeal not only to Jews but to pagans in the Roman
    Empire. It could do so effectively only by breaking with Rabbinic Judaism.
    This is the reason for increasing negative references in the Gospels to
    “the Jews” (especially in John), blaming them for the crucifixion of
    Jesus. Christianity was able to make great strides in recruiting converts
    and competing with other sects, such as the Mithraic religion. But it could
    only do so by disassociating itself from Rabbinic Judaism. It developed a
    more universal message, which, incidentally, was already implicit in the
    letters of Paul (written some fifteen to twenty years after the crucifixion
    of Jesus): the new Christians did not need to be circumcised nor to practice
    Judaic dietary laws.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Thus, the biblical texts drawn on in
    The Passion of the Christ should not be read literally as diatribes against
    the Jews per se, but rather as the record of a dispute among two Jewish
    sects competing for ascendancy—between traditional and Christianized
    Judaism.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">If one reads the four Gospels side by
    side, as I have done numerous times, one finds many omissions and
    contradictions. Evidently, their writers never knew Jesus in his own
    lifetime. Each Gospel was crafted post hoc to satisfy the immediate
    practical needs of the new Christian churches then developing. They were
    contrived by human beings, motivated by the transcendental temptation to
    believe in Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of mankind. The Gospels
    thus are historically unreliable, and insofar as The Passion of the Christ
    used them, it is also. But Gibson goes even beyond the Gospels, as I have
    indicated.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The Establishment of
    Christianity</font></strong>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I submit that there are two important
    inferences to draw from this analysis: first, the union of a religious creed
    with political power can be extremely destructive, especially when that
    creed is supported by the power of the state or the empire. It was the
    conversion of the Emperor Constantine (around 312 C.E.) that led to the
    establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire,
    some three centuries after the crucifixion of Jesus. The “Nicene Creed,”
    which was the product of the counsel of Nicaea (convened in 325 C.E.), said
    that Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate. It also declared Jesus the
    divine Son of God “in one substance” with the Father. The decision which
    books should be included in the New Testament was political, determined by
    the vote of the bishops attending the council of Nicaea. At this and other
    church councils, various apocryphal books revered by particular Christian
    communities were omitted from the canonical scriptures. So much for historic
    objectivity.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Emperor Julian (331-363 C.E.), a
    nephew of Constantine and a student of philosophy, became skeptical of
    Christianity and was prepared to disestablish the Christian church, which he
    probably would have done had he not been murdered, most likely by a
    Christian soldier in his army. In any case, Christianity prevailed and the
    great Hellenic-Roman civilization of the ancient world eventually went into
    decline. But this occurred in no small measure because of political factors:
    the grafting of the Bible with the sword, and the establishment of an
    absolutist Christian creed, intolerant of all other faiths that disagreed
    and willing to use any methods to stamp out heresy.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">By the fifth century more and more of
    the inhabitants of the Roman Empire became members of Christian churches,
    which replaced pagan religions. Christianity reigned supreme across Europe,
    North Africa, and the Middle East. The latter two were overrun by the
    Muslims in the seventh and eighth centuries, but feudal Europe remained
    stolidly Christian as it entered into the so-called Dark Ages. Only with the
    Renaissance, the Reformation, the development of science, and the democratic
    revolutions of our time was the hegemony of Christianity weakened. The
    secularization of modern society brought in its wake naturalistic ideas and
    humanist values.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The union of religion and political
    power has generated terrible religious conflicts historically, pitting
    Catholics against Protestants, opposing Jihadists versus Crusaders, and
    triggering constant wars among Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and
    others. God save us from God-intoxicated legions that have the power to
    enforce their convictions on those who disagree! All the more reason to laud
    the wisdom of the authors of the American Constitution who enacted the Bill
    of Rights, including the First Amendment, prohibiting the establishment of a
    religion.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Freedom of Inquiry</font></strong>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The second inference to be drawn is
    that the origins of the Christian legend have for too long lay unexamined,
    buried by the sands of time. The New Testament was taken by believers as
    given, and no one was permitted to question its sacred doctrines allegedly
    based on revelations from on high. But skepticism is called for—the same
    skepticism that should also be applied to the alleged revelations received
    by Moses on Mount Sinai and other prophets of the Old Testament. Orthodox
    Jews who accept the legend of a “chosen people” and the promise that God
    gave Israel to the Jews likewise base this conviction on uncorroborated
    testimony. Today, we have the tools of historical scholarship, biblical
    criticism, and science. We can draw upon two centuries of sophisticated
    scholarly and scientific inquiries. We can apply circumstantial evidence,
    archaeology, linguistic analysis, and textual criticism to authenticate or
    disconfirm the veracity of ancient literary documents. Regrettably, the
    general public is almost totally unaware of this important research. The
    case is similar for the revelations of Muhammad and the origins of Islam in
    the Qur’an. Since they are similarly uncorroborated by independent
    eyewitnesses, they rest on similarly questionable foundations. There is
    again a rich literature of skeptical scrutiny. But most scholars are fearful
    of expressing their dissenting conclusions.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The so-called books of Abraham—the
    Old and New Testaments and the Qur’an—need to be scrutinized using
    rational and scientific analysis. And the results of these inquiries need to
    leave the academy and to be read and digested more widely. Unfortunately,
    freedom of inquiry has rarely been applied to the foundations of the
    “sacred texts.” Indeed, until recently severe punishment of religious
    dissenters was the norm in many parts of the world.</font>
  </div>
  <div align="justify">
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Given the tremendous box-office
    success of Mel Gibson’s film, there are bound to be other Jesus movies
    produced — for Jesus sells in America! The Passion of the Christ
    unfortunately may add to intolerance of dissenters; and this may severely
    endanger the fragility of social peace. It may further help to undermine the
    First Amendment's prohibition of the establishment of religion, which has
    been the mainstay of American democracy. This indeed is the most worrisome
    fallout that the Gibson film is likely to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
