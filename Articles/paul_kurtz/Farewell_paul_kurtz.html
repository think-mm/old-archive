  <h1>Farewell Fair Play</h1>
  <h2><font size="5">by Paul Kurtz</h2>
  </font><font size="3"><hr></font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="Kurtz_Paul.2000.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="162" height="225">Something 
  awful seems to be happening to the traditional American sense of fair play and 
  goodwill. The public response in support of the victims of September 11 
  notwithstanding, in general there seems to be a decline of empathy and 
  altruism. Perhaps I am overreacting, but this deficiency seems to assume many 
  forms.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">What immediately comes to mind is our treatment of 
  prisoners. I refer first to the great flap that emerged worldwide over the 
  Bush administration's refusal to place the prisoners of war captured in 
  Afghanistan under the rules of the Geneva Convention. They are &quot;unlawful 
  combatants,&quot; we were told; or they are &quot;dangerous and our guards need to be 
  protected&quot;; or, in still another statement, &quot;They do not deserve any better.&quot; 
  I've always thought that the Geneva Convention provided commendable rules 
  governing the treatment of prisoners of war, rules that all civilized nations 
  should follow. The prisoners are being treated &quot;humanely,&quot; we were told. 
  Surely, we would want our own soldiers, if captured anywhere in the world, to 
  be treated in accord with the Geneva Convention. How can we demand this in the 
  future if we violate these rules today? President Bush relented after much 
  criticism at home and abroad and grudgingly declared that Taliban prisoners 
  would come under the Geneva Convention, but not members of the Al Qaeda. Many 
  critics believe that this concession does not go far enough.</p>
  <h3>&quot;The Quality of American Mercy Is Not Strained&quot;</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This cavalier dismissal of the Geneva Convention has 
  disturbed civil libertarians in the United States and our allies throughout 
  the world. So has the treatment of thousands of Arabs and Muslims in the 
  United States, recently apprehended by the Justice Department and held 
  incommunicado and without bail. They are &quot;terrorists,&quot; says the 
  administration; but how do we know unless they are indicted and put on trial 
  and processed through the American system of justice? Will the infamous deed 
  of September 11—which we all abhor—and the fear of future terrorist acts so 
  erode our sense of justice that we will abandon our traditional adherence to 
  democratic due process?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps there is something deeply amiss, for a similar 
  vindictiveness is often displayed as well in our treatment of American 
  prisoners, incarcerated for a wide range of infractions. The War on Drugs in 
  particular has taken a vast toll on the American sense of balance, and its 
  result seems close to the development of a police-state mentality. Bursting 
  into homes at all hours to jail alleged drug offenders—even for possession or 
  use of marijuana, for example—seems like an extraordinary overreaction. Drug 
  offenders are considered &quot;wicked.&quot; Not that I wish to encourage drug use, but 
  shall we abandon our free society to rout out drug use while we permit 
  cigarette smoking and the abuse of alcohol, the two most noxious drugs 
  available? From all reports, brutality in American prisons seems to be 
  intensifying. Has vindictive justice gotten the best of us? I was interested 
  to see William Bennett, the paragon of Christian virtue, railing against sin 
  recently at a convention of American conservatives, defending the harsh 
  tactics of the drug police. Whatever happened to the quality of mercy among 
  those who express the Christian faith?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Another painful sign of the retributive mentality is seen 
  in the fact that we still exact the death penalty; indeed, the United States 
  is the only democracy that does. Our European allies are offended by capital 
  punishment, and many countries now are refusing to honor extradition to the 
  United States if the accused would risk suffering the death penalty. It is 
  highly questionable that capital punishment serves as a deterrent. Surely we 
  need to deal with those who commit heinous crimes. I would myself recommend 
  life imprisonment for such offenders without the right of parole. But should 
  not one of the aims of incarceration be <i>rehabilitation</i>, and should not 
  a civilized society exert efforts to educate and reform offenders so that they 
  may be returned to society? Instead we seem to have an exaggerated sense that 
  punishment is good for its own sake and that those who commit crimes deserve 
  retribution.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It seems to me that what is happening in the United 
  States is that we have been overtaken by a religious sense of retributive 
  justice and that this has taken on exaggerated proportions. Surely one of the 
  purposes of punishment and incarceration is to protect society from criminals. 
  Granted, but beyond that do we need to provide cruel and unusual punishment? 
  Whatever happened to compassion?</p>
  <h3>The Bloated Defense Budget</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I am also dismayed that the end of the Cold War has not 
  reduced our military budget. We seem so frightened by enemies, domestic or 
  foreign, that we are willing to spend vast sums on armaments and reduce our 
  expenditure on domestic programs, such as medical insurance for those who lack 
  it. The United States has also reduced foreign-aid assistance throughout the 
  world. The ministers of the wealthy Group of Seven nations have recommended 
  that these nations donate 0.7 percent of gross national product for 
  international-aid programs for the poorest nations of the world. The United 
  States currently provides the lowest percentage, only 0.1 percent. Secretary 
  of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill is a strong opponent of this aid, one reason 
  why the United States is now known as &quot;Uncle Scrooge.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">President Bush's proposed military build-up would exceed 
  that of the Reagan years. The administration proposes to increase defense 
  spending by $120 billion over the next five years—at a time, incidentally, 
  when it proposes that taxes be reduced and the deficit increased. It is 
  interesting that the United States now spends an estimated 50 percent of all 
  arms expenditures in the world. The Religious Right seems to need demons, real 
  or imaginary, to guard against—formerly they were Bolsheviks, socialists, 
  left-wingers, liberals, secular humanists, child abusers, drug fiends; there 
  are now terrorists in place of the anarchists of earlier epochs. H. L. Mencken 
  wryly observed: &quot;The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace 
  alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an 
  endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.&quot; How true this is of the 
  American political scene today.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The America that we love has in the past defended 
  democracy and human rights and offered aid to those suffering disasters 
  worldwide. Has this America become a swashbuckling military power, pursuing a 
  unilateral foreign policy insensitive to the views of the world—such as the 
  abrogation of international treaties? Are we no longer the hope of the world, 
  but a nationalistic state pursuing our own self-interests? Today Afghanistan 
  is defeated. Will we follow the president tomorrow by putting out of 
  commission Iran, Iraq, and North Korea? I fear that America will lose its 
  cherished friends and allies throughout the world, and her self-respect, and 
  pursue imperialist policies that may be turned against us in the future by new 
  coalitions of adversaries.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2><a name="Why Not">Why Not</a> a Palestinian/Jordanian State?</h2>
  <h3>A New Holocaust?</h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Six million Jews were lost in the Nazi holocaust of World 
  War II. Will the nearly six million Jews now living in Israel suffer a similar 
  fate? This stark reality may very well confront the world one day unless this 
  festering conflict is resolved. Israel has borders that are barely definable 
  and hardly defensible. Apparently the only thing that stands between it and 
  destruction is Israel's strong defense forces, including nuclear weapons and 
  the United States.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In my view a creative solution of the impasse between 
  Israel and Palestine that should be explored is to have Palestine merge with 
  Jordan and create a greater Palestinian/Jordanian federation, which could 
  provide a viable homeland for the Palestinian people and enable them to 
  achieve the statehood that they so passionately desire. This state would 
  include the 94 percent of the West Bank and the one-third of Jerusalem already 
  offered by former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and rejected by President Yasser 
  Arafat. Since the Gaza Strip is not viable and is filled with a great number 
  of refugees, there could be an exchange of populations and territories. (The 
  Israelis might vacate the settlements on the West Bank, ceding them to the new 
  Palestinian/Jordanian state, and the Arabs would in turn cede the Gaza Strip 
  to Israel.) The condition would be that Israel's right to exist be recognized 
  by Palestine and other Islamic states.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I should say right off that I am here speaking personally 
  and not on behalf of this magazine, which represents a wide range of differing 
  political viewpoints. May I wax autobiographical: I was in Germany as a GI 
  with the American Army of Liberation during and immediately after World War II 
  and witnessed the freeing of the survivors of Dachau, Buchenwald, and other 
  concentration camps. When many of these displaced persons told me that they 
  intended to go to Israel to establish a Jewish state, I said that I thought 
  that this was a mistake. I was particularly skeptical of the Old Testament 
  story that God had promised Israel to the Jews. How could fewer than one 
  million Jews, I asked, stand against hundreds of millions of Arabs? Thus, I 
  had serious misgivings about Zionism, and I recommended that survivors stay in 
  Europe or immigrate to other countries of the world. These hapless individuals 
  told me that they had nowhere to go and that most countries would not welcome 
  them.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A Jewish state was established by the United Nations in 
  1948. Arab armies immediately tried to crush it, but without success. Hundreds 
  of thousands of Palestinians who lived in Israel at that time fled, or in some 
  cases were driven out. Hundreds of thousands of other Jews (estimated at up to 
  850,000) were forced to leave other countries in North Africa and the Middle 
  East, from Morocco to Egypt and Syria, where they had lived in many cases for 
  two millennia or more. Israel managed to survive in spite of repeated 
  invasions by Arab armies. And it was able to reach accords with both Egypt and 
  Jordan, returning large sections of the occupied land. Any effort to sign a 
  peace treaty with Syria or with Arafat and the Palestinians, as we are well 
  aware, has been to no avail.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">To my mind the Oslo Peace Process and the Mitchell Plan 
  seem most promising, and the proposals of Prime Minister Barak a reasonable 
  compromise. Israel would return most of the West Bank and part of Jerusalem, 
  which could be the capital of both the State of Israel and a new 
  Palestinian/Jordanian state. But this plan failed because of the Palestinian 
  demand for the right of return to Israel proper. Given the emergence of 
  suicide bombers, this would have made Israel untenable and its destruction 
  inevitable. This is apparently what Hamas and Hezbollah fervently wish. The 
  carved-up and emasculated state that Arafat insisted upon would make Israel 
  unsustainable, always open to attack; nor would it be sufficient for a viable 
  Palestinian state, divided from the Gaza Strip.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The key point is that Israel now exists <i>de fact</i>o. 
  To give America and Canada back to the Indians or Australia back to the 
  Aborigines would be impracticable. Likewise to insist that Israel allow the 
  right of return of all Palestinians would not be feasible. Israel fears that 
  the Muslims might eventually overwhelm the Israelis and convert the state into 
  an Islamic theocracy.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">No doubt there is some basis for justice on all sides of 
  this tragic situation. An end must be put to the bloodshed of senseless attack 
  and retaliation. The Palestinians want statehood. Israelis want a state with 
  defensible borders.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In my view the Palestinians deserve a state, but there 
  are underdeveloped lands to the east. Therefore I would suggest that a new 
  Palestinian/Jordanian federation could provide the Palestinians with a viable 
  nation and that forging such an agreement would enable Israel to live 
  peacefully behind secure borders. As part of this solution I would recommend 
  that the United Nations guarantee peace by monitoring the borders during a 
  period of, say, fifty years.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But this would require an end to religious terror and 
  intolerance. Religions, when taken literally, degenerate into fanaticism. When 
  ancient texts—either the Koran or the Bible—are used to justify present 
  political realities, the result is bloodshed and conflict. A necessary 
  condition of peace is almost certainly that both the Palestinian/Jordanian 
  state and Israel be secular and democratic. I would suggest that the world 
  community work with the Israelis, Palestinians, and Jordanians to come up with 
  a new creative proposal—to create a new Palestinian/Jordanian state and an 
  Israeli state that can live in peace with its neighbors.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A brief historical note is perhaps useful: In ancient 
  days &quot;Palestine&quot; referred to the present state of Israel, the West Bank, and 
  large sections of Jordan. The entire region was occupied by the Turks for 
  centuries. After their defeat in the First World War in 1920, Britain was 
  awarded a mandate over the entire region of Palestine and Jordan (then known 
  as Transjordan). In the Balfour Declaration of 1917, Britain declared its 
  intention to establish a Jewish National Home, and it designated the Arab 
  State as Jordan in 1927. Jordan annexed the West Bank in 1950, but this was 
  occupied by Israel after being invaded by Arab armies in the 1967 Six-Day War. 
  Subsequently there were bloody conflicts between the Palestinian refugees and 
  Jordanians. The Palestine Liberation Organization and Arafat were expelled 
  from Jordan, though 60 percent of present Jordanian citizens were originally 
  Palestinian refugees. There have been intermit-tent efforts to incorporate the 
  West Bank and Jordan. I suggest that this option be explored anew. If this is 
  to be achieved it is important that Chairman Arafat work out a <i>modus viendi
  </i>with King Abdullah of Jordan. To integrate Jordan and the West Bank could 
  make for a genuinely sustainable and durable society co-existing peacefully 
  with Israel.</p>
