  Humanism and Politics: When Should We Speak Out?</font></span></h1>

  </font>
  <p><font size="3"><em>The following article is from <a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/fi/index.htm"><cite>Free
  Inquiry</cite> magazine</a>, Volume 23, Number 3.</em></p>
  <hr>
  </font>
  <p>In the last issue of <i>Free Inquiry</i>, we published an editorial
  criticizing the morality of the preemptive war against Iraq. It was written
  before the war began and published after its start. Several readers objected
  strongly to this. This raises the basic question: Should secular humanism as a
  movement ever take political positions? Surely individual humanists, as
  citizens in a democracy, may participate in the political process. They can
  vote for candidates and support the political part(ies) of their choice. Many
  humanists, to be sure, are intensely committed to a political point of view.
  But should secular humanist organizations such as the Council for Secular
  Humanism take positions on the burning political issues of the day?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are four cogent arguments against the Council's becoming a political
  pressure group:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First, as a nonprofit organization we are prohibited from supporting
  candidates and/or engaging in political propaganda. This prohibition applies
  to the Christian Coalition, the Roman Catholic Church, and other nonprofit
  agencies as well, all of which at least theoretically risk losing their
  tax-exempt status if they engage in political activity of that sort. If some
  other nonprofits wink at this principle, we embrace its propriety.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Second, although secular humanists share a common set of beliefs and
  values, they may differ about any number of concrete political and economic
  measures.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Third, for the Council to endorse specific party platforms or candidates
  for office, and/or to identify with one part of the political landscape, might
  alienate other supporters who disagree. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are
  found on all sides of the political spectrum; why not secular humanists? For
  that reason, this argument goes, we are wise to avoid any narrow political
  litmus test and welcome everyone into our (pardon the expression) big tent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fourth, our movement is primarily educational. Our outlook and our mission
  are scientific, philosophical, and ethical. Politics is not part of our core
  mission. If even a hospital, supermarket, university, or art museum were to
  engage in partisan politics, many of its patrons would be offended.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Those are powerful arguments. Surely we should not define ourselves
  primarily as a political pressure group. At the present time, at least, the
  positions we take should be prudential, leaving room for dissent.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And yet, does all this mean that the Council for Secular Humanism should be
  absolutely nonpolitical, holding itself above comment on the issues of the day
  in antiseptic purity? Surely not. I would submit that we have a responsibility
  to speak out on issues that we consider vital to our scientific humanist
  outlook. Indeed, I would submit that doing so is an important part of our
  educational mission.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If we are not primarily a political pressure group, under what conditions
  may we speak out on political issues? There are no fixed guidelines.
  Nonetheless, I wish to offer some criteria. Primarily, I submit, we have an
  obligation to make ourselves heard when vital moral issues are at stake. There
  is no sharp divorce between ethics and politics. If, as Clausewitz argued, the
  purpose of war is to fulfill political purposes, then the purpose of politics
  is to fulfill the ends and values that we consider desirable—especially when
  it impinges on our fundamental ethical values.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That there is an intrinsic continuity between ethics and politics is a
  classical idea. It was first expressed in Athens, most notably by Plato and
  Aristotle. The theme reappears throughout the history of political thought.
  Machiavelli took another approach, maintaining that the goal of politics was
  to secure and maintain power. For Machiavelli, there were certain policies
  that a ruler should adopt, many of them brutal, in order to achieve political
  aims. I readily grant that governing a nation is complicated, and that
  technical rather than moral issues are often relevant. Nonetheless, the
  overall aim of politics is to realize certain long-range moral goals deemed
  desirable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Accordingly, secular humanists should speak out and act when they believe
  that their cherished values and beliefs are at stake; they should seek to
  persuade their fellow citizens about the principles that they consider
  important to endorse and defend.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I submit—and I am speaking personally here—that at the present moment
  in American society, our cherished values and beliefs are indeed at stake.
  They are under threat. This being the case, then declining to speak out would
  be an affront to our deepest convictions. German theologian Dietrich
  Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) eloquently stated that he should have protested earlier
  in the 1930s, when the Nazis first began to implement their repressive
  policies. Many Americans are today deeply disturbed about political
  developments. They are frightened by what they view on the domestic front as a
  drastic threat to our cherished democratic civil liberties, and
  internationally to the entire framework of international law and order so
  painstakingly developed over past decades. They are concerned about the
  unilateral preemptive war undertaken by the United States in Iraq, its
  abrogation of the test ban and Kyoto treaties, its bypassing of the United
  Nations, and its refusal to endorse the International Court of Justice.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the face of such dangers, how can we hold silent?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Getting our theories straight is important; but it is praxis, the practical
  consequences of our actions, that is the best test of our efficacy and
  influence. Purely theoretical humanism is a mere abstract concept, without
  content, of no moment for the real life of humans as lived; thus, the
  relationship of humanism to praxis is central. (I have called this in my
  writings &quot;eupraxsophy.&quot;)&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If &quot;God is dead,&quot; as Nietzsche proclaimed at the beginning of the
  twentieth century, then at the dawn of the twenty-first century we must affirm
  that &quot;humans are alive.&quot; The power of the humanist message is that
  life itself is intrinsically worthwhile, that we aspire to achieve the best of
  which we are capable, including the expression of our highest talents and
  creative excellences, that we cultivate the common moral decencies, that our
  goal is exuberant happiness. To achieve all this we need to develop a just
  social order for our own society, regionally, and on the planetary scale. We
  humans are responsible for our own destiny: &quot;No deity will save us; we
  must save ourselves&quot; (Humanist Manifesto II).</p>
  <p>The key message of humanism is not that humanists are nonbelievers in
  theistic religion—atheists, agnostics, or skeptics—but that we are
  believers, for we believe deeply in the potentialities of human beings to
  achieve the good life. Indeed, we wish to apply the virtues and principles of
  humanist ethics to enhance the human condition. If we indict the
  theological/messianic claims of the ancient religions for providing false
  illusions of salvation, then we also need to state that we are concerned with
  improving the conditions of human life, with improving the cultural, social,
  economic, and political institutions in which human beings find themselves at
  various times in history. The underlying premise here is our emphasis on
  humanist ethics: how we create a better life for ourselves and our fellow
  human beings in the real world, here and now, and in the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let me hasten to say that, although we are concerned with moral and
  political issues, we should not be identified simply with any political party
  or particular candidates for office. We should guard against politicizing
  humanism. We have long argued in the pages of <i>Free Inquiry</i> that we
  should be open to Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives,
  libertarians and social democrats, radicals and centrists, Greens and
  Independents. There is no single humanist response to every complex social or
  public issue that may arise. Ideologically, secular humanists may be
  laissez-faire free-marketeers or democratic socialists; they may believe in
  the mixed economy or a federal world government. And surely they may differ on
  taxation policies, public school vouchers, affirmative action, same-sex
  marriage, the legalization of prostitution, immigration, foreign policy,
  defense spending, war and peace, and countless ancillary issues. It is clear
  that there have been conservative humanists, such as George Santayana and
  Antony Flew; liberal democratic humanists such as John Dewey, Richard Rorty,
  Betty Friedan, and Sir Karl Popper; and socialist humanists such as Erich
  Fromm, Sidney Hook, and Svetozar Stojanovi&quot;c. They all should have a
  place within the &quot;mansion&quot; of humanism.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Accordingly, I would suggest that our primary focus is more fundamental: we
  are interested in cognitive and ethical questions, in achieving, especially at
  the present juncture, a cultural renaissance or cultural reformation. We
  should concentrate on that. We offer a distinctive set of intellectual and
  normative values. We emphasize the importance of reason and critical thinking,
  and we wish to use these methods in order to reformulate and refashion our
  values, and to raise the quality of taste and the level of appreciation in
  society. Humanism is life-affirming; it is positive and constructive. If
  applied, it would enable us to reform human culture by transcending the
  ancient religious, racial, ethnic, and ideological dogmas of the past that so
  adversely affect human civilization in the present. We thus call for a New
  Enlightenment, a rediscovery and a reaffirmation of the highest values of
  which humans are capable.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Where does this leave us on the key principle of politics? I think that
  secular humanists need to speak out critically about present trends in the
  United States. The Council for Secular Humanism has not in itself taken
  corporate positions—and will not do so unless there is a clear and present
  danger to our very democratic liberties. <i>Free Inquiry</i>, however, does
  take positions. The magazine has autonomy of expression. And the editors have
  exercised freedom of the press. I would identify at least three areas in which
  we have taken stands on political issues.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First, we have objected to the recent threats to our liberties on the part
  of the George W. Bush administration: the Homeland Security and PATRIOT acts,
  the suppression of civil liberties, the erosion of our liberties by moneyed
  interests and lobbies, the control of the media by conglomerates with their
  smothering of dissent, and the emergence of a plutocracy based on wealth and
  property. All of these trends will if unchecked undermine our democratic
  institutions. We are especially concerned about the growing apathy of the
  young in politics, perhaps as a result of the pervasiveness of mass media
  violence, sensationalism, and mind-numbing entertainment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Second, we have questioned the current direction of American foreign
  policy, with its broad-ranging antipathy to a peaceful world order, to the
  United Nations, and to the development of institutions of world government.
  Apparently, U.S. foreign policy is to be driven by a greedy &quot;National
  Security Strategy&quot; under which we may carry out preemptive strikes
  anywhere in the world. Does this mean that a new and imperial pax Americana
  shall dominate the world, replacing the policies of deterrence and the balance
  of power? Our unilateralism has offended our friends all over the world, for
  we have abandoned many of the ideals that inspired the American dream-ideals
  of individual freedom, equality of opportunity, human rights, and democracy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Third, and perhaps least controversially for humanists, we have objected to
  this administration's egregious violation of the separation of church and
  state by championing faith-based charities and similar measures. It distresses
  us that the president uses his office as a bully pulpit to further the ends of
  Evangelical Christianity. Surely President Bush has the right to his own
  religious convictions, but it is disturbing when he and his administration
  invoke them to establish policies that threaten our secular democracy. In our
  view, the Bush presidency has been captured by the Radical Right and an
  alliance of Protestant Evangelicals, conservative Roman Catholics, and
  Orthodox neoconservative Jews. This alliance is bringing into being a new
  monotheistic quasi-theocracy. Its moral-religious outlook spills out into the
  political sphere in the nomination of arch-conservative judges, and also in
  such policies as the administration's opposition to any support for population
  assistance to the developing world. A political posture that affects every
  aspect of American life has been inspired by a theological-moral outlook; and
  we have every right to protest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We have published these strong dissenting opinions about the current
  policies of the administration in <i>Free Inquiry</i> magazine and on our web
  site; though some secular humanists have objected and they have accused us of
  being left wing (which is unfair). The key editors who signed that represent
  the Libertarian, Republican, Democratic, Independent, and Green (Social
  Democrat) parties. <i>Free Inquiry</i> has indeed given space to alternative
  viewpoints, particularly about foreign policy. Later in this op-ed section, we
  present five essays embodying a wide range opinion on the Iraq war, which
  includes both antiwar essays and defenses of the war by Edward Tabash and
  Steve Hirsch. Two of our marquee columnists, Christopher Hitchens and Nat
  Hentoff, have voiced outspoken support for the war in other media and would be
  welcome to do so in <i>Free Inquiry</i> if they chose.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><i>Free Inquiry's</i> masthead states that &quot;opinions expressed do not
  necessarily reflect the views of the editors or publisher.&quot; A free press
  is vital to our democracy and the secular humanist movement. Thus there is
  editorial autonomy for the editors and columnists. We recognize and cherish
  diversity of opinion. Unlike the Vatican or the Southern Baptist Convention,
  secular humanism has no compulsory dogmas. On the other hand, we do have a set
  of ethical principles that is central to our humanist commitment. I submit
  that the editors can and indeed do speak out on the following moral-political
  issues, as broadly drawn:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First, we are committed to free inquiry, the free mind, freedom of
  research, respect for civil liberties, and the open democratic society. This
  entails the right to believe, or not believe, in prevailing religious or
  ideological doctrines. We object to any effort to censor or prohibit dissent
  and restrict liberty.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Second, we defend the separation of church and state and the secular state.
  Accordingly we are strong critics of efforts to impose theocratic or
  quasi-theocratic measures.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Third, in endorsing freedom of the individual, we embrace the right of
  privacy. This encompasses freedom of conscience, the right to control one's
  body, reproductive freedom, contraception, euthanasia, abortion, and sexual
  freedom between consenting adults, all of which we have consistently defended.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fourth, as democratic humanists we believe in equality of opportunity,
  equal access, and fair treatment of all individuals in society. We have
  supported the rights of women, gays, handicapped people, Blacks, Hispanics,
  nonbelievers, and other minorities.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fifth, we believe in Planetary Humanism, which applies the principles of
  ethics to all humans anywhere on the planet Earth, rising far beyond any
  narrow focus on ethnic, racial, religious, or nationalistic chauvinism (see
  Humanist Manifesto 2000). This underlies our support for the development of
  global institutions that can provide conditions of peace, security, economic
  well being, cultural education, and enrichment for every person on the planet.
  We are thus opposed to any effort to encourage a world of competing
  nationalistic rivalries; and we believe in building a world community.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the secular humanist movement does not have a narrow
  political agenda nor a party platform. Broadly speaking, we are committed to
  the application of the method of intelligence to the solution of political and
  social problems. This is the purpose of the Center for Inquiry, of which the
  Council is a part: to apply reason, science, and free inquiry to all areas of
  human concern, and to develop rational ethical and social alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We recognize that many socio-political problems are very complex and often
  difficult to solve. There are no simple solutions. We appeal to committed
  naturalists and secular humanists who accept our basic scientific,
  philosophical, and ethical premises, yet may sincerely disagree with any of
  the above political choices: do not abandon us, but rather argue your
  convictions with equal intensity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Humanists bring to the bargaining table a unique kind of optimism about the
  human prospect. We respect diversity of opinion, including differences among
  ourselves. We believe that rational discourse is preferable to violence and
  warfare, that compromise is superior to conflict, that debate and deliberation
  comprise the best method for resolving differences. We should, as best we can,
  raise our voices loud and clear in the current maelstrom of conflicting
  opinions. The secular humanist position is an honorable one. It is based on
  deeply held convictions, rooted in reason, and focused on an ethical concern
  to enhance, fulfill, and realize human happiness, peace, and tranquility on
  the globe. This point, though so brilliantly apparent to us, remains a
  minority position in the world today. Yet we need to affirm it.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And in that sense, we need to need to take strong moral-political stances
  when basic values are endangered.&nbsp;
