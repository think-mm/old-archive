  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">My
  response to a very innocuous e-mail impelled me to write this fastidious
  essay. Let me first elaborate on this. Just about four years ago, I set on my
  overseas sojourn from my native Bangladesh to a foreign university. In the
  beginning, it was really difficult to ignore the immense enthusiasm that I
  enjoyed browsing free Internet provided by this university. You may literally compare my situation similar to a frog used to
  live in a well, suddenly let in a big
  ocean. This academic place was abound with immense free-flow of knowledge. It
  was in such a profound milieu of scholastic freedom that I truly became
  obsessed with—even to the extent of forgetting my food to the cyber world! I
  skimmed and skimmed—in search of knowledge; almost like exploring an ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While searching the net in this fashion, I suddenly
  received an e-mail from Mr. Jamal Hasan; along with it, the address of the
  website <a href="http://www.bangladesh-web.com/news">www.bangladesh-web.com/news</a>,
  an on-line newspaper; News From Bangladesh (NFB). At first, I was not that
  keen on this website being a bit skeptical about the quality. Then, when I really visited the website, I was simply
  amazed and perplexed. After reading a few informative, high-quality articles,
  I was extremely flabbergasted. That many Bangladeshi Muslims, a rather very
  conservative society, wrote those high caliber, rational and secular essays was quite
  unthinkable to me. Indeed, it was a great surprise to me, to say the least. I
  still remember very clearly one such essay, entitled, ‘The Qur’anic
  Folklore—Who Was Zulkernain?’ When I read that article, I was simply
  dumbfounded—no exaggeration. Even the names of the authors were also pretty
  odd :Syed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kamran Mirza, Fatemolla—no,
  never did I hear such names in my life, I swear. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">That
  was the beginning. Gradually, I came know about Abul Kasem, Aparthib Zaman,
  Narayan Gupta, Sabbir Ahmed, Dr.Jaffor Ullah, Jahed Ahmed, Dr Ali Sina, Dr
  Kaushik Sen, Bishnu Dey, Paramanab, Shabnam Nadiya and many others. Each of
  them was like a spark of fire. A little later, I set up ‘<b>Mukto-Mona</b>’ (<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com">https://gold.mukto-mona.com</a>
  ), a progressive, secular and humanist Internet forum for the people mainly of
  Bengali origin. This forum is very much in the know to many overseas
  Bangladeshis familiar with various Internet forums. Mukto-Mona has always put
  forwarded opinion contrary to the prevalent views—an exception, you might
  say. That is why Mukto-Mona has become famous; expressing the voice of the
  dissents and the unconventional--to explain further. In a world replete with
  religious bigotry and communalism, Mukto-Mona stands out as a beacon of a
  progressive, guiding light, that will enlighten many a soul groping in
  darkness.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">I
  leave the topic of Mukto-Mona for a while; not forgetting that the history of
  Mukto-Mona is very unique, no doubt. I deliberately brought out the affairs of
  Mukto-Mona, as I am quite sure that it (Mukto-Mona) is now essentially
  intertwined with the theme of this essay.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Let me
  be back to NFB, once again. I noticed that not all writers of NFB had
  unchained the shackles of religion to pen their essays. I do remember a
  distinguished Western educated university professor; always unrelenting in
  finding science in a specific ancient religious scripture. Now a day, it is a
  trend that has immensely engulfed a good number of educated Bangladeshi
  Muslims—a sort of fashion, we may say. Their main motivation has sprouted
  from the ‘shattering’ works of <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/western_scientists_.htm" target="_blank"> two Occidental charlatan
  scientists</a>--Dr
  Maurice Bucaille and Dr Keith Moore. They blithely discovered in <i>Qur’an</i>,
  ‘Big-Bang’, ‘expansion of the universe’, ‘theory of evolution of
  human species’, science of ‘atoms and molecules’, ‘milky-way,
  ‘constellation’, ‘white dwarf’, ‘black-holes, ‘embryology’,
  ‘theory of relativity’, ‘theory of super string’…and what not. Now,
  our distinguished professor, mentioned before, imbued with such inspiring
  discoveries, was writing endless article in NFB to prove how ‘super
  scientific’ the <i>Qur’an</i> is! Enough was enough! Finally, I decided to
  protest against his non-stop ranting. I wrote, ‘why try to find
  ‘Big-Bang’ in <i>Qur’anic</i> verses, thousands of years old’? There
  are plenty of books on Astrophysics dealing with ‘Big-Bang’. Why not
  consult those books instead? 'For example', I explained - 'if we want to learn about the solution of
  differential equations then we invariably have to refer to books on
  Mathematics'. Can we find the solution of differential equations
  in the <i>Qur’an</i>? I questioned him. After reading my audacious essay,
  the gentleman exploded—like a freshly set bomb. In his next epic sized
  essay, he spared no pain to exhort the utter shortcomings of my understanding
  of science and Islam. How stupid and foolish I was, he had no hesitation in
  surmising. Citing examples after examples from innumerable sources, he was
  hell bent in proving only fact—that is, all modern science is absolutely
  indicated in the <i>Qur’an</i>. <i>Qur’an</i> is definitely a ‘Book of
  Science’, he was very adamant.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:
EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">When
  his obdurate, obstinate and bigoted approach pushed me to my limit, I was
  compelled to write this essay. My contention was quite simple: if we read
  carefully, we surely note that those ancient religious scriptures were
  composed at a time when the humanity had a very limited understanding of
  scientific knowledge. One cannot legitimately expect to find the complex
  theories of ‘Big-Bang’, 'Super String', 'Relativity' etc. in the
  pages of those dated Holy Books. In reality, the contents of those primitive
  books reflected the sheer backwardness prevalent in the contemporary society;
  their thoughts, belief, hopes and despair; nothing more than that and nothing less. Let me
  illustrate with an example: when the holy <i>Qur’an</i> was composed (a
  better word is compiled, I should emphasize), the eminent scientists like
  Galileo, Bruno, Copernicus, et.al were not even born. How could the people of
  that primeval period even think of an earth, revolving around our sun? Nay,
  they could never comprehend this, as they were familiar only with the sun
  rising in the east and then setting in the west; the rising of the moon at the
  onset of night. These are the phenomena they have observed since their birth.
  God controls these heavenly objects, they thought. That certain laws of
  physics govern the progress of these celestial bodies, they could never
  comprehend. This is what is accurately reflected in many verses of the <i>Qur’an</i>,
  <i>Hadis</i>, <i>Vedas</i> and the Bible. Consider this verse from <i>Sura
  Luqman</i> <i>(31:29) </i>from the holy <i>Qur’an </i>[<a href="#koran_bible_gita_ref">15</a>]:<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoHeader" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">
    Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and
    causeth the day to pass into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the
    moon (to do their work), each running unto an appointed term; and that Allah
    is Informed of what ye do?</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In this verse <i>Allah</i> clearly
  says that he is the one who converts the day into night and vice versa;
  subjected the sun and the moon to follow a fixed orbit. We find many similar
  verses elsewhere in the <i>Qur’an</i> as well. Here are a few samples: <i>Sura
  Ya-Sin</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/036.qmt.html#036.038">36:38</a>),</i> <i>Sura Az-Zumar</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/039.qmt.html#039.005">39:5</a>),</i> Sura <i>Al-Rad</i>
  (<i><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/013.qmt.html#013.002">13:2</a></i>), Sura <i>Al-Anbiya</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/021.qmt.html#021.033">21:33</a>),</i> <i>Sura Al-Baqara</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.258">2:258</a>),</i>
  <i>Sura Al-Kahf</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qmt.html#018.086">18:86</a>),</i> <i>Sura Ta-Ha</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/020.qmt.html#020.133">20:130</a>),</i> just to
  name a few. However, even a thorough, painstaking search of the entire <i>Qur’an</i>
  does not show a single verse anywhere in it that supports the scientific
  reality of the rotation of earth. According to Allah, the earth is motionless,
  completely static. Period.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In
  <i>Sura An-Naml (27:61)</i> it is stated clearly:&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Is not He (best) Who made the <b> earth
    a fixed abode</b>, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm hills
    therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas? Is there any Allah
    beside Allah? Nay, but most of them know not!</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In the same vein, <i>Sura Al-Rum (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/030.qmt.html#030.025">30:25</a>),</i> <i>Sura Fatir</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/035.qmt.html#035.041">35:41</a>),</i> <i>Sura Luqman</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/031.qmt.html#031.010">31:10</a>),</i>
  <i>Sura Al-Baqara</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.022">2:22</a>),</i> <i>Sura An-Nahl</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/016.qmt.html#016.015">16:15</a>) </i>exhorts
  the <i>Allah’s</i> decree that the earth is completely immovable.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Since the previously mentioned scholar
  was absolutely certain that the <i>Qur’an</i> contains all the scientific
  principles, with due respect, I earnestly requested him to show me a verse,
  just a single verse in the <i>Qur’an</i> that states that the earth moves
  round the sun; or that the earth rotates on its own axis, at the least. ‘I
  shall accept all your contentions, for sure, if you can show me such a
  verse’, I wrote. The Arabic word for earth is ‘<i>Ard</i>’ and the
  Arabic word for rotation is ‘<i>Falak</i>’. ‘Please show a just a single
  verse in the <i>Qur’an</i> that uses the two words ‘<i>Ard</i>’ and ‘<i>Falak</i>’
  side by side’, I insisted.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>He
  could not show me a single verse to that effect.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Of course, he could never succeed; I
  knew this from the very beginning. How could he succeed when it is totally
  certain that there is no such verse/s in the <i>Qur’an</i> as I had already
  elaborated?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People of that era
  did not have the knowledge to calculate the speeds and periods of diurnal and
  annual rotations of the earth. The transition from the ‘Geo-Centric’
  concept of the earth of Ptolemy to Copernicus’ ‘Helio-Centric’ universe
  took a long time to hold. People during Muhammad’s time had the slightest
  clue as to the mystery ‘where do the sun go at night?’ They had no idea on
  sun’s movement, to say the least. The sun really proceeds to a far-off
  place to take rest—this was their notion about the setting of the sun. The
  learned readers will have no trouble in finding this truth out by simply
  gleaning through the <i>Sura</i> dealing with <i>Zul-Karnain</i> <i>(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qmt.html#018.086">18:86</a>)</i>:&nbsp;<o:p>

  <blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Till, when he reached the
  setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a

  kindness.</span><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">How is it possible for Allah to commit
  such a humongous blunder—come to think of it! Have our learned Islamic
  scholars, searching endlessly for ‘Big-Bang’, ‘Super String’, etc. in
  the <i>Qur’an</i> has ever seriously pondered on it? <b> How could Allah think
  that the sun must have a resting place of its own!</b> How could we accept the
  Qur’an as a ‘Book of Sciene’? Shall we not consider it a book of comic,
  instead?&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Many
  readers may not be aware that the 'Muslim World' considers Muhammad to be the
  greatest scientist, thinker and philosopher that <i>Allah</i> ever created.
  Now, think about the funny answer, this ‘greatest’ creator of science gave
  when people questioned him: Where does the sun hang about at night? In a
  conversation with one of his companions (Abu Dhar), Muhammad claimed that the
  sun ‘prostrates’ under the throne of Allah for the entire night and seeks
  His permission to go to its usual work in the morning! Let us read this <i>hadis

  will be foolhardy to assume that those erudite scholars making desperate
  attempts to demonstrate science in ancient scriptures are not aware of those
  laughable verses. Surely, they are very much aware of them (verses). With full
  knowledge, they deliberately confuse the gullible people. This is exactly
  where I have severe objection. My response to this Islamic scholar did create
  some stir among many readers. Many progressive web-sites duly published my
  essay and even one threw a challenge to the fundamentalist Mullahs under the
  heading, ‘Avijit Roy challenges the fundamentalists.’ This challenge
  still stands in the cyber world [<a href="#challenge">2</a>]. So far, no Islamic scholar could refute my
  assertions by citing the appropriate verses from the <i>Qur’an</i>.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US">Let me
  elaborate more on this particular word, “Challenge.” Many people consider
  this word (Challenge) to be a very crude and impolite. But those who are
  long-term practitioners of Rationalism and Skepticism know rather well that a
  challenge could really be a lethal weapon. There are many rationalists who
  have issued ‘earth shattering’ challenges on many topics. Some of them
  have challenged the divine and spiritual ‘gurus’; some have challenged the
  Astrologers about their fortune telling; some challenged the medical practices
  of the so- called Faith Healers while many others have challenged the
  infallibility of Holy Scriptures. I can cite the example of challenge by the
  ‘Amazing’ Randi, the founding fellow of the Committee for the Scientific
  Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). He had issued a challenge
  of one million dollars to the practitioners of supernatural power. Dr Abraham
  Kovoor, a life-long fighter against superstitions, has also thrown similar
  challenge. Prabir Ghosh, a Bengali Rationalist has issued a challenge of fifty
  thousand Indian Rupees to the powerful clique of Astrologers. The Bangladeshi
  magician, Jewel Aich has also proclaimed a challenge to prove the existence of
  the genies <i>(Jinns) </i>and ghosts. Those who consider the <i>Qur’an</i>
  to be the infallible words of <i>Allah</i>, Dr Ali Sina, a member of
  Mukto-Mona and the co-founder of Faith Freedom International, has a challenge
  for them. The truth is: challenge is an important phase of movement of
  rationalism by the freethinkers. Being in tune with <a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/prabir/">Prabir Ghosh</a>
  [<a href="#challenge">3</a>], I would also
  like to announce, “<i>Those cows who have been
  elevated to such lofty positions through advertisement and media, let us bring
  them down to earth to graze there by issuing challenges to them. A challenge
  may not be ‘nice’ to the vacillators, the opportunists and the envious
  people, but it (the challenge) does expose the truth. A popular and logical
  question is: If you are so sure to prove your claims, then why not accept the
  challenge?</i>&quot;</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language:

  us without any support. This was possible, only because God possessed an
  incredible supreme power. We read an uncannily similar verse in <i>Sura Luqman</i>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Due to advancement in scientific
  knowledge, we of course, know for certain, that the sky is not the roof of the
  earth. The truth is: there is absolutely no such object called ‘sky.’ In
  reality, the ‘sky’ is actually our limit of vision. The blue in the sky we
  see is nothing but scattered blue light only
  due to the presence of the atmosphere surrounding our planet. Take the example
  of the ‘sky’ of the moon; it is absolutely black. Why? Because there is no
  atmosphere around our moon! However, the trouble is: we do not find any such
  scientifically correct explanation in the so-called ‘super scientific'
  religious books!
  Sometimes, I wonder how long will it take us, the human to be enlightened!

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">It is certainly palpable from those
  verses that there is no accord between the <i>Qur’anic </i>motionless, flat
  earth and the modern physicist’s concept of a round-shaped earth. Please
  read the previously mentioned verse 18:86 once again. This verse states that a
  faithful servant of <i>Allah</i>, did actually saw the sun to set on a certain muddy
  place. Verse 18:90 (of the same <i>Sura</i>), even describes a particular
  place where the sun rises. Naturally, one would not hesitate to ask: why did
  Allah think that the sun must have a definite abode for its rise and a
  definite abode for it to set or to take rest? Only one conclusion can be made
  from such an idea, and that is; in <i>Allah’s</i> sight, the earth is surely
  a flat surface.&nbsp;<o:p>
  &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">We can definitely deduce from the
  fixed prayer times that the ancient people were quite accustomed to the notion
  of a flat earth. <a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/profile.htm"> Aroj Ali
  Matubbar</a> [<a href="#aroj_ali">5</a>], the peasant-philosopher of Bengal has
  further elaborated on this idea of flat earth in his book ‘<a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/">The
  Quest for Truth</a>’ Let us take this opportunity to examine his elaboration.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In Islam, it is compulsory to offer
  prayers five times a day. Preset times are appointed for these prayers.
  Offering of prayers apart from these set times are forbidden. For example, a
  Muslim cannot pray at sunrise, at sunset or at midday. We know from the
  diurnal rotation of earth that, at any fixed time, the sun is seen at any
  position on earth and as such, a prayer can be offered at any site on the
  earth. What does this mean? Consider the following fact. When the sun is
  rising at Barisal (a district in Bangladesh), it has still not risen at
  Calcutta (in West Bengal, India). However, in Chittagong (another port city in
  Bangladeh), the sun is already up. So, when offering prayer at Barisal is <i>haram</i>
  (forbidden), it is not <i>haram</i> at Calcutta or at Chittagong. Thus, can we
  find any justification for imposing a ban on offering of prayers at some other
  times apart from the set times of prayers? Aroj Ali Matbor,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the rationalist, in his book mentioned before has posed a very
  interesting question: Suppose, a Muslim, after offering the <i>Zuhr</i> prayer
  at 1:30 PM, leaves for Mecca. Arriving in Mecca, he will be surprised to note
  that it is yet not noon there. So, shall he offer another <i>Zuhr</i> prayer
  at Mecca too? The answer to this enigma is actually contained in the question
  itself. Aroj Ali, himself has answered this question in a rational way. <b>
  According to him, there was a time when the concept of earth as stationary and
  flat was very much in vogue. From this perception, the idea of fixed times for
  prayers emerged—he opines</b>. Nonetheless, this old concept is now dead;
  instead, the modern science has proved that the earth is round and in motion.
  That is why complications have arisen while trying to fit the modern day
  life-style with age-old religious doctrines. These complications will
  definitely keep increasing in future, no doubt. Here is a very compelling
  illustration: if an astronaut or an aircraft pilot flies at a speed of 1041.67
  miles an hour from the west, he will find the sun to be motionless, still.
  This means that, for the air-passengers there will be no such time as morning,
  noon or evening—as if the sun is standstill at one position only! What would
  happen to prayer and fasting—come to think of it? If in future, human
  habitation is established in the North Pole, there will be more problems.
  There is approximately six month of days and six months of nights at this forlorn place.
  Will it be possible to strictly follow the rules of fasting as well the
  dictums of five prayers a day between sunrise and sunset there? Please ponder
  closely on this issue and you will surely discover that the root cause of this
  problem is the erroneous idea of a flat and motionless earth.&nbsp;<o:p>
  &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Let us search history. A famous Arabic
  scientist of the twelfth century did think that the earth is not really flat
  but round. As soon as his idea became known, all his works were declared as
  blasphemous, his books confiscated and burnt. Just a few years ago, the
  supreme religious authority of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdel Aziz ibn Baaz issued
  a <i>fatwa</i> (Islamic edict) in this fashion:&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">‘The earth is indeed flat. Those who
  do not accept this are atheist—they deserve to be punished.’ In his book
  ‘The Demon-Haunted World’, Karl Sagan has enunciated this fatwa in detail.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The Hindu scriptures are also similar.
  A vivid description has been cited in page 169 of Narasingha Mythology. That
  is why, Jambbudipa, an organisation at Baroda, Gujrat is working relentlessly
  to prove ‘scientifically’ the infallibility of Vedic ‘flat’ earth
  belief.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font color="#003300">In
  September 15, 1999, Tim Miller, professor and chair of religious studies at Kansas
  University, claimed that &quot;The Bible says the Earth has four
  corners,&quot; said and added that he believes the Earth is either a square or
  a tetrahedron, a solid figure with four triangular faces.</font></span> It is quite amazing to observe that, based on the
  erroneous idea, some people, even in this twenty-first century still upholds
  that the earth not round-- rather flat. They even have formed societies, named
  International Flat Earth Society (<a href="http://www.1hup.edu/-dsimanek/fe-scidi.htm">http://www.1hup.edu/~dsimanek/fe-scidi.htm</a>)
  and ‘The International Square Earth Society’ (<a href="http://pwi.net.com/-rogermw/square_earth.html">http://pwi.net.com/~rogermw/square_earth.html</a>).
  These are all laughable organizations; their main aim is to prove that the
  earth is actually flat, no matter what science says!</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>Thanks to Bucaille and Moor, we
  repeatedly return to the topic of divine power of the <i>Qura’an</i>. Let us
  face squarely—Is the <i>Qur’an</i>’ really celestial, supernatural and a

  </span>To paraphrase from the Bengali singer Suman Chatterjee (who borrowed from Bob Dylan's
  &quot;Blowin' in the wind&quot;), I
  must write, “The questions are easy; the answers, too are known.” The
  answer is that&nbsp; <i>Qur’an</i> can never be a miraculous, heavenly book. Just
  like any other ancient religious scripture, the <i>Qur’an</i> is also
  littered with downright errors, sheer antiquated beliefs, absolute scientific
  blunders and numerous ambiguities, to say the least. In actuality, there is no
  ‘Big-Bang’, no theory of Relativity, no Black Holes, not even the concept
  of atom-molecule in the entire <i>Qur’an</i>. What we find in the name of
  ‘Big-Bang’ and Relativity is the cunning and deceptive manner in which
  certain <i>Qur’anic</i> verses are interpreted. Here is an example.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Allah it is Who raised up the heavens
  without visible supports, then mounted the Throne, and compelled the sun and
  the moon to be of service, each runneth unto an appointed term; He ordereth
  the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye may be certain of the
  meeting with your Lord.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The above verses actually depict a
  very obscure and ancient idea of the universe. Don’t you think that the
  concept of support-less roof and the placement of mountains for the earth not
  to shake is very much akin to the use of a heavy paper-weight on a piece of
  paper so that it is not blown away by the wind? And what did <i>Allah</i> do to
  prevent the ‘sky’ from falling on heads? Yes, He supported the ‘sky’
  on unseen pillars! How could one pass these as twentieth century science?
  Still more strange is this part of verse 21:30:…the heavens and the earth
  were of one piece, then we parted them, …..’ If these few words are really
  the proof of ‘Big-Bang’, then one may legitimately ask;&nbsp; where is the
  mention of the huge explosion? The word ‘Big-Bang’, itself, is very
  significant here. Where do we find the sign of that famous ‘Bang?’</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>
  &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Furthermore, in Physics, the
  ‘Big-Bang’ is related with space-time singularity, not with matter per se.
  The earth did not even exist when the ‘Big-Bang’ took place—the earth
  having been born billion years after the ‘Big-Bang’! The above verses are
  clearly referring to earth and sky being &quot;joined&quot; (which doesn't
  even have a common sense or scientific meaning) together and then being split
  apart (again meaningless as per science), and that is all. Of course, from
  scientific point of view this is a complete nonsense—not to talk of
  ‘Big-Bang’.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Therefore, simply using a few jargons
  and playing with words in the above verse (21:30), in no way expresses
  scientifically, the ‘Big-Bang’ incidence. We learn from Quantum Physics
  that, just after the ‘Great’ explosion, the four forces of nature, the
  strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electro-magnetic force and the
  gravitational force existed as a unified ‘super force.’ Where in the above
  verse one can find this scientific truth? How could one calculate the Hubble
  Constant from the above verse? How can we compute the Doppler effect? There
  is, of course, no answer on these questions.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">If there is no answer of those
  scientific enquiries, how can one make himself convince that those verses
  actually describing big bang, not the partition of an egg before making an
  omelet ?&nbsp; On this matter, the readers with an open mind on
  the exegesis of the <i>Qur’an</i>, may refer to the essay, ‘<a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/article/10_myths_about_Quran.htm">10
  top-most scientific myths about <i>Qur’an</i></a>' kept in the archives of Mukto-Mona
  website.</span></p>

  <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">One important issue must be bear in
  mind: due to my debate with the exegetes of the <i>Qur’an</i> one must never
  assume that the ‘experts’ of other Holy scriptures are free from blame. In
  reality, they are all same and akin to the other side of the coin, and that is
  all. There are a number of Hindu ‘divine’ philosophers who will insist
  that the world-vision shown to <i>Arjuna</i> by Lord <i>Krishna</i> as
  mentioned in the epic, <i>Mahabharata </i>was nothing less than
  ‘Big-Bang’. Mr. Mrinal Dasgupta, a prominent scientist of National Indian
  Academy of Science, insists that the ancient sages already knew about the
  constant new discoveries of theories of science of today—the <i>Vedas</i>
  are quite clear on this, he is adamant. According to him, even a scientist of
  the calibre of Openheimer was so much impressed by the scientific content of
  the <i>Geeta</i> that when the intense power of atom dazzled him, he recited
  the hymns in Sanskrit from the <i>Geeta </i>[<a href="#prabir_ishware_bishwash">6</a>]:

  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Many Hindu scientists are quite
  certain that the discoveries of modern science are nothing but the repetition
  of the scientific knowledge scribed in the Hindu scriptures eons ago. The
  communalistic organization like Ramkrishana Mission is preaching that the
  existence of ‘Black Holes’ is nothing new—the Hindus knew about them a
  long time ago. How? One may ask. Their answer is the famous words uttered by
  the supreme Lord <i>Brahmma</i>: 'One moment of <i>Brahmma</i> is one thousand years
  for earth'. Some Hindus will even stretch their believe to bizarre extreme
  saying that the mythological war of <i>Kurkshetra</i>
  was nothing but an Atomic War. One popular Indian writer, Prasanata Pramanic, in
  his Bengali book ‘Modern Science in Indian Philosophy’ has stretched his
  imagination even to the extent of <i>Mohenjodaro</i>. In page 6 of his book he
  wrote, “It is most likely that an ally of <i>Durjodhan</i> (a character in <i>Mahabharata</i>)
  was annihilated in a nuclear holocaust in Mohenjodaro [<a href="#mohenjodaro">7</a>].” These ‘Veda-addicted’ utopians
  will, unhesitatingly claim that the modern ‘test tube baby’ and
  ‘surrogate mother’, though attributed to modern science is nothing new to
  Hindu civilization. They will invariably cite examples of the mythological
  births of <i>Dhrone-Dhroni</i>, <i>Kripa-Kripi</i> etc. Even the recently used
  Scud and Patriot missiles in the Gulf war are ascribed to the likes of ‘<i>Barun
  Baan</i>’ and ‘<i>Agni Baan</i>’ of Hindu mythology. These
  ‘scientists’ will, invariably find similarities between modern science and
  Hinduism in practically everything. Such was the case with the eminent Indian
  magazine, <i>The Desh</i>: Hrishikesh Sen, the author of the article,
  ‘Science and God’ published in the <i>The Desh</i> on April 22, 1995,
  found the similarity between the modern model of the universe and the
  ‘spider’ described in the Vedas. Strange comparison, indeed.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<o:p>Aparthib
  Zaman, a prominent member of Mukto-Mona severely criticized this futile
  attempt to search science in religious scriptures. In an article on this topic he succinctly
  wrote:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">'&nbsp;I see an attempt here to link
  planetary nebulae with a religious verse. This is a flawed attempt that is
  often made by apologetics of all religions, some more than others. If one
  likes to see science in anything they can see it anywhere. Some Joe may have
  said &quot;All is relative&quot; before Einstein's theory of relativity. By
  this stretch of imagination that Joe can legitimately claim that he already
  knew about relativity and claim originality. Any vague phrase, pun, quote etc
  by humans, scriptures etc can be customized and made to fit any scientific
  principle which also have been phrased in a very general way for popular
  consumption hiding the underlying precise sense of these principles. Its an
  insult to science and the scientists whose painstaking research has helped
  unravel the complex workings of the laws of nature and reality. None of these
  scientific revelations were inspired from, dependent on, or utilized any of
  the religious revelations. If religious revelations could not and did not lead
  to any of these scientific truths in a stand alone way then by any criterion
  and logic they cannot be used to corroborate science. There are many
  unanswered questions in the basic understanding of the universe. Why can't the
  verses of scripture throw any light on them? For example we don't at this time
  know for sure if the universe is closed, open or flat. No body dares to make a
  prediction based on any revelation. But if it is ever found out by science I
  am sure one can dig out some vague words of a verse from some book of some
  religion and claim to &quot;see&quot; the answer that science has finally
  managed to find. <font face="Arial, Helvetica"> Its always AFTER the fact that
  these semblances are found. It has never been found BEFORE the scientific
  discovery. </font>
 Is that a coincidence?'

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Realizing this sheer nonsensical game
  of the religionists, Probir Ghosh, in his book, ‘Why I don't believe in
  God’ has mentioned a very interesting analogy [<a href="#prabir_matal">8</a>]
  . Let us ask a drunken person
  about the model of this universe. At first, the drunkard may simply look at
  the questioner with baffling eyes; pick up the bottle from the street and
  drink more. Then he will throw the empty bottle in the street and start
  walking. If we wished, we could easily liken the whole episode to the affairs
  of the universe. We may compare the full bottle as the expanding universe, the
  drinking and emptying the bottle means the drunkard was saying that at a
  certain time this expansion (of the universe) will come to a stop and then
  contraction will ensue. Then, when the drunkard cast away the empty bottle he
  wanted to imply that before the contraction of the universe starts, all
  creations will be annihilated, leading to the point of singularity. Shall we
  accept this explanation as plausible?</span></p>
  <p class="MsoHeader" style="tab-stops:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-AU">Of course, the above explanation is
  absolutely nonsense, to say the least. For the last few years, we see with
  dismay, this game of sheer stupidity is being played in Bangladesh. This is
  exactly similar to the futile attempt of elucidation of the universe through
  the drunkard’s behavior cited above. Books, such as, '<i>Gyaner kotha</i>' (Of
  knowledge<i>)</i>, '<i>Lojja</i>' (Shame</span>)<span lang="EN-AU"> are readily banned on the lame excuse of hurting the
  ‘religious sensitivity’ of the public. Even a freedom fighter like<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Mr Wahab is shamed by parading around his village with shoe
  ‘necklace’ around his shoulder [<a href="#wahab">11</a>] for the simple ‘crime’ of reading books
  such as ‘ <a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/">The
  Quest for Truth</a>’ by Aroj Ali Matbor and '<i>Je golper shesh Nei</i>' (The never-ending
  Story) by Devi Prasad Chatterjee; Taslima Nasrin [<a href="#taslima">12</a>] is exiled from her
  motherland [<a href="#interview_taslima">13</a>]; Ahmed Sharif [<a href="#ahmed_sharif">14</a>], Ali Asghar, Kabir Chowdhury are declared as <i>Murtads</i>
  (apostates) for exercising their right of free-speech. On the other hand, with
  the generous patronage from the Government, the Islamic Foundation publishes
  the pseudo-science book, like ‘Scientific Identification in Holy <i>Qur’an</i>’.
  With the blessing of the blind faithfuls and the fatalist believers, the likes
  of Bucaille and Moore have a great feast with the huge circulation of their
  ‘great’ scientific books. The entire Bangladesh is now flooded with books
  such as ‘<i>Al-Qur’an</i> the greatest Bangla book of science,’ Space and the
  challenge of the <i>Qu’ran</i>’, ’<i>Qur’an</i> or Science’,
  ‘Science and <i>Al-Qur’an</i>’, just to name a few. Last year, while
  celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of Mukto-Mona, Dr Ajoy Roy,
  a Professor of Dhaka University wrote in his essay, ‘Scientific
  Mind and Building of a Society Based on Science Oriented Thought’ [<a href="#scientific_mind">9</a>]:&nbsp;<o:p>

  books are the only source of knowledge, then stagnation will result in the
  society, the society would turn into a static state in its conscience and
  thinking, creativity would be replaced by superstition, unproductiveness,
  narrow-looking attitude, illiteracy and foolishness. That type of society
  would be retrogressive and backward looking. What we see in our society?
  Superstition and fruits of technology mutually co-exist. We don't want the
  reason of science; we want only its fruits in our material life; side by side
  we will nourish blind faith and submission to fate. We decorate our drawing
  with a colored TV and watch satellite program, send our hysterical daughter to
  the abode of a <i>peer </i>(religious guru) instead of taking to medical center.-
  this kind of contradiction is possible only in our society. In this society it
  is possible for a microbiologist to carry on higher research biochemistry , at
  the same time kissing the feet of a famous <i>peer</i>. It is in our society
  possible for a learned political scientist to a research monograph on secular
  political system at the same time to rush to a half educated spiritual <i> peer</i>
  for begging his blessings to have a lucrative coveted post of administration.
  This is the typical panoramic view of our society we are used to see.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Indeed, today, this is the reality of
  our society—a society that is on a journey riding a strange camel to fit
  with religion! In this age of supreme advancement of science, when the chain
  of religion is gradually being loosened elsewhere, when the humanity has every
  doubt and skepticism about religion, a relentless effort is mounted to
  perpetuate the religion-based sheer exploitation of the gullible devotees by
  brainwashing them. It is a very clever strategy, no doubt—repackaging
  religion in modern science. It is a kind of drug and many people are hooked on it.
  Under the morbid influence of such a powerful narcotic, people have really
  started to believe that the 1400 years old scripture do augment the theory of
  ‘‘Big-Bang’’ or the concept of time dilation is really contained in
