										awaited responsible step of return to 
										the table of talks from the relentless 
										street confrontation programmes has

										should conclude with smiling faces of

										issues to the streets again. Because

										and shortage of pure drinking water?
										<O>&nbsp;</O></span></p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
										However, it will be also wrong to judge 
										that any ill compromised settlement 
										shedding `basic principles' of the 
										reform proposal which is not ensuring 
										free, fair, neutral and acceptable 
										election will suit the situation. The 
										dialogue is getting very much watched by 
										the conscious section of the public, as 
										such, the&nbsp; wishes of the citizens of the 
										country stays firm with the dialoguing

										<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
										<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">
										The main point is, we all want to see 
										ahead that a peaceful resolution of the 
										reform issue is made to its letter and 
										spirit through dialogue with its smooth 
										and effective implementation prior to 
										the election. That is what the reform 
										agenda is all about; which is indeed 
										meant to be implemented for a free, 
										fair, neutral and acceptable election, 
										so that the people are blessed with a 
										competent Government, a responsible 
										opposition and a proper functioning 
										Parliament from the run-out of the 2007

										Are the wars of instigative words which

										these instigative words other than 
										peaceful mobilization for show of 
										support which is normal in democratic 
										practices, I reckon that is nonetheless 
										going to heighten the egotistic attitude 
										vitiating the atmosphere of healthy 
										dialogue. The success of dialogue 
										depends on proper expression of 
										rationales behind the proposals and 
										mobilization of public opinion favouring 
										the logic. Show of confrontational 
										attitude is only going to mar the 
										situation further. Neither of the

										CTG of their choice etc. have pushed the 
										Government in the back seat already on 
										the issue of reforms of election rules 
										on qualification of the candidates, the 
										CEC, the EC and the CTG. The dialogue is 
										only a way out now for the Government 
										party for a respectable exit from the 
										mess. Nobody now believes a fair 
										election is possible now under the 
										incumbent CEC and the designated Chief 
										of CTG and without reforms of election 
										rules.

										Both the Alliances should realize that

										Therefore, I believe the `four party 
										alliance' will do their best for 
										successful dialogue. There are talks 
										about mutual concessions for reaching 
										settlement. Concessions do not depend on 
										the alliances alone. The civil societies 
										and the citizens have stake in this 
										dialogue because people have so much 
										suffered during last 5 years for 
										non-performing Parliament. If the 
										concessions are perceived to have not 
										ensured a performing Parliament, then in 
										that case both the alliances shall have 
										to bear the brunt of the people's 
										discontent expressed through the votes 
										during election. On the other hand if 
										the dialogue fails, whoever may be at 
										fault, nevertheless the Government will 
										be the victim of suspicion with erosion 
										of public support manifested through 
										support expressed to opposition's 
										movement as well as subsequent drastic 
										swing of voting in the election to 
										opposition's favour. For simple reason, 
										that it was opposition alliance who 
										first proposed reforms.<O>&nbsp;</O></span></p>

										So is there any other way for the four 
										party alliances but to come out 
										victorious with a successful dialogue 
										and cash the credit for favouring the 
										environment for a free, fair, neutral 
										and credible election and on that claim 
										the swing of votes in their favour. BNP 
										for being the much acclaimed and popular 
										democratic political party grown out of 
										struggle against autocratic regime; why 
										should they suffer with defeatist 
										syndrome when people wins?
