					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Brief History of 
					India&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The civilization of India, the Indus Valley Civilization, is 
					at least 5000 years old. The land between Mayanmar (Burma) 
					to the east, Afghanistan to the west, China to the north, 
					and the Indian Ocean to the south was known as Bharat 
					(India) for millennia. It was a land of many kingdoms, never 
					really one politically defined country. Today’s India was 
					formed in 1947 when the British-ruled India was divided into 
					two countries, India and Pakistan. The eastern and the 
					western parts of the subcontinent formed Pakistan, while the 
					middle part became today’s India. In 1971, Pakistan broke up 
					into today’s Pakistan and Bangladesh.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Philosophy of 
					1947 and Today’s India&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the Indian nation, is well 
					known to the world for his spinning wheel, where he used to 
					weave his own cloth. While that probably was a primitive 
					approach to self-sufficiency, it was indeed a powerful 
					symbol for India to depend on its own. The other major 
					leader of India’s independence movement from Britain, 
					Jawaharlal Nehru, had a more modern approach to a truly 
					independent India. Under his guidance were formed the Indian 
					Institutes of Technology. Today, India has many world-class 
					schools of higher education, and is second only to the 
					United States in producing scientists and technologists. 
					While it is not yet considered to be a developed nation, it 
					is indeed as self-reliant as most developed nations.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 
					this talk I would like to discuss some sociopolitical issues 
					of India about which, I think, most Americans are not clear.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Democracy&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					Since its birth in 1947, India has been a multiparty 
					democracy. Unlike many nations that got freedom from the 
					British colonial rules, including its neighbors to both the 
					east and the west, India has never been run by military 
					dictators. Somewhat like in the United States, the central 
					government of India has been run by two major political 
					parties, the Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party 
					(the Indian Peoples’ Party), BJP.&nbsp; However, the duopoly 
					there is not as powerful as that in the United States. That 
					is why, like some of the Western European democracies, India 
					has seen quite a few coalition governments, when no single 
					political party had more than 50% of the seats in the 
					parliament. Just like some countries of Western Europe, 
					India also had to have run-up elections because of breaking 
					up of political coalitions. It is clearly to India’s credit 
					that a hugely diverse population of many ethnic, linguistic 
					and religious communities has maintained smooth democratic 
					transitions of governments, even during collapses of 
					political coalitions.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ethnic, Linguistic 
					and Religious Diversity&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					There are primarily three ethnic groups in India, the 
					Indo-Aryans, the Dravidians, and the Mongoloids. Hindi is 
					the national language of India, and is the primary language 
					of about 30% of the people. India has 14 other official 
					languages, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, 
					Malayalam, Kannada, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, Kashmiri, 
					Sindhi and Sanskrit. These are languages, not merely 
					dialects, and they are pretty much as good as the European 
					languages in terms of standard usage. Because of the British 
					colonial past, English is widely used and understood in 
					India. India’s religious groups include, Hindus (81%), 
					Muslims (12%), Christians (2%), Sikhs (2%), Buddhists, Jains, 
					and Parsis.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Hindu Caste 
					System&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The caste system among the Hindus of India is probably the 
					most nagging sociopolitical problem of the country. 
					According to this system, Hindus are divided into four 
					classes. The Brahmins are the preachers and the 
					intellectuals, the Kshatriyas are the warriors and the 
					politicians, the Vaisyas are the business people, and the 
					Sudras are the peasants and the laborers. Outside this caste 
					system are the untouchables. The problem is, this system of 
					division has been giving economic power to some people, 
					while depriving some others, generation after generation. 
					There is no way for a lower caste person to get promoted to 
					a higher caste. For centuries, this system of division and 
					injustice in the Indian society has kept a lot of hatred 
					there, and made the subcontinent quite suitable for foreign 
					invasions and occupations. However, in today’s India much of 
					the educated population has been ignoring the caste 
					division. The state has been giving preference to 
					historically lower caste people in educational and 
					professional opportunities. Unfortunately, the process is 
					quite slow, and there is still a lot of caste hatred among 
					the illiterate and uneducated masses, particularly in the 
					vast rural and remote areas of India.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religious 
					Conflicts&nbsp;</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					India was divided in 1947 to create the state of Pakistan 
					for the Muslims, based upon what is known as the two-nation 
					theory. According to this theory, some Muslims justified the 
					division by saying that the generally less educated and less 
					powerful Muslims had to have a separate country in order to 
					have their proper share of power in the Indian 
					subcontinent.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					However, this division has created enormously more problems 
					than solutions. Millions of absolutely innocent non-Muslims 
					have been killed, made inferior citizens, and forced to 
					leave the land of Pakistan by the forces of the Hindu-Muslim 
					two-nation theory. While this kind of hatred against the 
					non-Muslims happened in a large scale in 1947, it really 
					never stopped. It is going on in Pakistan and Bangladesh 
					even today with the support and sponsorship of the state, 
					and the non-Muslims from there continue to migrate to India. 
					During the chaos of 1947, in spite of a secular leadership 
					in India, hundreds of thousands of innocent Muslims either 
					felt too insecure to stay there, or were forced to leave 
					India by the Muslim-haters there. However, the Muslims of 
					today’s India are treated by the state with equal rights, 
					and they are not at all migrating to the Muslim dominated 
					states of Pakistan and Bangladesh.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The present governing political party of India, BJP, is 
					considered by many to be Hindu nationalistic. While there 
					are elements in the party that wish for a Hindu nation, 
					(they themselves probably do not know what that term means), 
					the leadership of the party is secular, and there is no 
					proposal on the table to run the country according to the 
					Hindu religion. Non-Hindus hold many powerful positions of 
					the state, including the President and the Defense 
					Minister.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					However, there seems to be a growing sense of resentment 
					against the Congress Party and the communist forces of the 
					country, where the allegation is that these forces have gone 
					overboard with their brand of secularism; that instead of 
					being truly religio-neutral, these forces have been 
					appeasing the Muslims. The fact that Hindu victims of 
					Islamic hatred continue to immigrate to India from Pakistan 
					and Bangladesh is also not helping the cause of Hindu-Muslim 
					harmony in India.&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Kashmir 
					Conflict between India and Pakistan</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The Kashmir problem of the Indian subcontinent has been 
					getting a lot of attention in America. However, most people 
					in this country probably do not realize the humanitarian 
					aspect of the problem.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					Legally speaking, all of Kashmir is supposed to belong to 
					India. When the British left in 1947, the king of the 
					princely state was given the authority to decide to join 
					either India or Pakistan, or remain independent. However, 
					before the king could make his decision, Pakistan invaded 
					Kashmir illegally. Before his state fell to the Pakistani 
					invaders, the king decided to join India and seek India’s 
					help in getting the Pakistanis out. Thus started the first 
					war between India and Pakistan, and the ceasefire agreement 
					divided the state of Kashmir between the two rivals along 
					the line of control. The dispute still continues, with India 
					making its claim on legality, and Pakistan making its claim 
					based upon its two-nation theory of Muslim brotherhood, as 
					Kashmir is Muslim-majority.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The Pakistani occupied part of Kashmir has already fallen to 
					the Islamic fanaticism of Pakistan, where the non-Muslims 
					are victims of state sponsored hatred of inferior 
					citizenship status, eviction from home, torture and murder. 
					A humanitarian world could not allow the Indian part of 
					Kashmir to have the same fate. The Indian part of Kashmir is 
					the most autonomous state of India, with Kashmiri Muslims in 
					control, except for the Indian security forces who are 
					fighting Islamic terrorists that are supported by Pakistan. 
					After more than half a century of division, it seems only 
					logical to convert the line of control into legal border 
					between India and Pakistan.</font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
					<h1 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India, a Natural 
					Ally of the United States</font></h1>
					<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
					The cold-war politics have kept a distance between the 
					United States and India for quite a few decades. Now that 
					the cold-war is over, it really is time for America to look 
					more objectively to find appropriate allies in the world. 
					India is clearly one country that America should look at. 
					Both America and India are democratic nations with 
					semi-autonomous constituent states. Both have people and 
					leaders that are religious, but keep religion away from the 
					business of the state. Both India and America have been 
					victimized by Islamic terrorists, the former for decades, 
					and the latter for quite a few years now. It was only 
					natural for India to offer complete support to America when 
					this country planned its fight against the al-Qaeda and the 
					Taliban in Afghanistan. Both America and India have large 
					technologically advanced manpowers. In the community of 
					nations, India and America really can be true friends with 
					mutual respect and admiration.</font></p>
