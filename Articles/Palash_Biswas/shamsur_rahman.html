										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't 
										forget the evening in Kolkata in 1991. I 
										was a newcomer in Kolkata. I stumbled to 
										a personality no less than the charming, 
										powerful poet of Bngladesh, Shamshur 
										Rahman via his beautiful poetry. I was 
										in the press and I saw a poetry 
										collection on the table of an artist. I 
										opened the book and sat down to settle 
										for the entire evening to go through the 
										lines. The beauty, the diction, the 
										power and content with a solemn style 
										mesmerized me. It was the beginning and 
										I never stopped to read poetry from 
										Bangladesh.</font></p>
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Comic Sans MS">I belong to a 
										partition victim family settled in 
										Uttaranchal in early fifties. I was born 
										and brought up there destined to inherit 
										a divided history, divided geography, 
										divided culture and heritage. My father 
										used to come Kolkata for books every 
										year and we read Rabindara Nath, Bankim, 
										Sharat and even Sukanta Bhattacharya. We 
										had the access to West Bengal based 
										classic literature and we had no idea 
										about the literature beyond the border. 
										In my college days, I had the 
										translations of Tarashankar, Manik, 
										Shankar and other prominent Bengali 
										writers. But only in 1980, when I 
										shifted to Dhanbad I had the taste of 
										some contemporary writings of Mahashweta 
										Devi, Prafulla Roy, Snil Gangopadhyaya, 
										Shankha Gosh, Nirendra Nath Chakrabarti, 
										Subhash Mukhopadhyaya, Shakti 
										Chattopadhyaya. Since 1991, I began to 
										read the Bangladeshi Literature 
										extensively and I found no one near 
										Shamshur Rahman in aesthetics and 
										content consideration and his commitment 
										was unquestionable. Shamsur Rahman&nbsp; was 
										indisputably the greatest poet of 
										Bangladesh, with more than sixty books 
										of poetry to his credit. And no one 
										should have any doubt about it.<br>
										<br>
										One of the great contemporary poets of 
										Bangla literature, Shamsur Rahman, 
										passed away yesterday.&nbsp; Bengalies across 
										the border and worldwide are in 
										mourning. Under Pakistani Rule, the poet 
										from East Pakistan had been a regular 
										contributor to the well reputed Bengali 
										Magizines of Kolkata like Kavita( 
										editor- Buddhadev Basu) and Kirtibas ( 
										editor- Sunil Gangopadhyay). Literary 
										circle in Kolkata feels the shock no 
										less than their counterpart in Dhaka. He 
										was 77only. He breathed his last at 
										6:35pm at the BSMMU (PG) Hospital in the 
										capital. The death sent a massive shock 
										to the Bangla speaking people at home 
										and abroad. He died when the attending 
										doctors removed the life-support “with 
										the consent of his family” after 
										spending 12 days in deep-coma at the 
										hospital. The poet was admitted to the 
										hospital on August 6 with multiple 
										complexities. Thousands of mourners 
										thronged the hospital to have the last 
										glimpse of their beloved poet, amid a 
										pall of gloom, as the news of his demise 
										broke in the city. <br>
										<br>
										Poet Shamsur Rahman was born in Dhaka in 
										1929. Fourth of 13 children of his 
										parents, he studied at Pogos School, 
										Dhaka College and Dhaka University. He 
										started writing poems after graduating 
										from Dhaka College at the age of 
										eighteen. Rahman studied English 
										literature at Dhaka University. He had a 
										long career as a journalist and was the 
										editor of the now defunct vernacular 
										national daily, Dainik Bangla. He won 
										numerous awards, including Bangla 
										Academy Award (1969), Ekushey Padak 
										(1977), and in 1991 he received the 
										highest national award –the Swadhinata 
										Padak (Independent Medal). The renowned 
										critic, Syed Manzoorul Islam, speaks of 
										Rahman as having <u>
										<font color="#800080">&quot;produced a solid 
										body of work which has permanently 
										changed the geography and the climate of 
										Bengali poetry. He has given it a new 
										dimension and a meaning, he has created 
										an ethos which belongs indisputably to 
										him. He has given us a language, which 
										we did not have. It is true he has built 
										on the ground of the 30's poets, but he 
										has developed the ground, explored into 
										areas they thought too dark for 
										exploration, has added new features to 
										it, landscaped it and in the process 
										left his footprints all</font> over.&quot;</u> 
										The critic, Z. R. Siddiqui, describes 
										Shamsur Rahman as one who is &quot;deeply 
										rooted in his own tradition.&quot; In his 
										opinion, <font color="#800080"><u>
										Shamsur Rahman &quot;still soaks the language 
										of our times, transcending the limits of 
										geography. In his range of sympathy, his 
										catholicity, his urgent and immediate 
										relevance for us, Shamsur Rahman is 
										second to none.</u>&quot;&nbsp; </font>
										</font></p>
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shasur Rahman 
										did not flee from Bnagladesh even in the 
										days of 1970 -1971 and he did not stop 
										writing. He was expressing the voice of 
										freedom without any fear. He was the 
										most secular intellectual in Dhaka. He 
										said 'no' to Islamic politics and 'yes' 
										to human rights. Shamsur Rahman was the 
										unofficial “poet laureate” of 
										Bangladesh. He chaired a national 
										committee of editors, writers and 
										artists dedicated to resisting 
										fundamentalist forces opposed to 
										individualism and democracy. 
										Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islam was named as 
										being behind his attempted murder in 
										early 1999, as part of a plot to kill at 
										least 28 prominent Bangladeshi 
										intellectuals. Harkat was described as a 
										group allied to bin Laden; its members 
										style themselves as the &quot;Bangladeshi 
										Taliban.&quot; Rahman was attacked in his 
										home. Three men affiliated with Harkat 
										stormed into his apartment wielding 
										pickaxes. Rahman's wife was seriously 
										injured, but he was not hurt. Neighbors 
										in his apartment building apprehended 
										the men and held them until police 
										arrived. The attackers admitted that 
										they intended to kill the poet. They 
										also stated that their group planned to 
										attack more intellectuals like Rahman, 
										who held outspoken secular views. As we 
										are now and supported by others, in 
										spite of the limitations of Islamic Rule 
										and lack of democratic setup, 
										Bangladeshi friends sustain their 
										pro-people stand always.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to 
										Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, there is a 
										strong current of secularism in 
										Bangladesh, but if that is so, it does 
										not show so far. </font></div>
