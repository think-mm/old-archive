											<font face="Verdana" size="2">My 
											father Pulin Kumar Biswas never 
											believed communists after Telengana 
											and Dhiri Block betrayal. During 
											seventies, while I was engaged in 
											students` movement and later in 
											Uttarakhand sangharsha Vahini, he 
											would never listen any reference to 
											ideology. Rather he sounded like 
											George Bernard Shaw who said, `&quot;The 
											Apple Cart exposes the unreality of 
											both democracy and royalty as our 
											idealists conceive them.&quot; In fact, 
											The Apple Cart is a treatise on the 
											impossibility of any kind of 
											government. Democracy, autocracy, 
											and monarchy are all making the best 
											of a bad situation, and none of them 
											is doing very well. Shaw is no 
											anarchist; he simply wants us to 
											recognize, as King Magnus does, the 
											invisible shackles that trip 
											government and turn it into a farce. 
											Shaw wrote in the `Preface to Apple 
											Cart', Besides, the conflict is not 
											really between royalty and 
											democracy. It is between both and 
											plutocracy, which, having destroyed 
											the royal power by frank force under 
											democratic pretexts, has bought and 
											swallowed democracy.&nbsp; Money talks: 
											money prints: money broadcasts: 
											money reigns; and kings and labor 
											leaders alike have to register its 
											decrees, and even, by a staggering 
											paradox, to finance its enterprises 
											and guarantee its profits.&nbsp; 
											Democracy is no longer bought: it is 
											bilked.&nbsp; Ministers who are 
											Socialists to the backbone are as 
											helpless in the grip of Breakages 
											Limited as its acknowledged 
											henchmen: from the moment when they 
											attain to what is with unintentional 
											irony called power (meaning the 
											drudgery of carrying on for the 
											plutocrats) they no longer dare even 
											to talk of nationalizing any 
											industry, however socially vital, 
											that has a farthing of profit for 
											plutocracy still left in it, or that 
											can be made to yield a farthing for 
											it by subsidies.'</font></p>

											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Verdana" size="2">I was 
											just born and I have simply no 
											memory of Dhimri Block uprising in 
											Himalayan terai. but I had enough 
											opportunity to witness the trail and 
											victimisation. In late sixties the 
											communists in terai played the role 
											of landbrokers in the same way as 
											buddha is doing it in West Bengal on 
											full scale. In our Bengali Refugee 
											areas the communist villages were 
											Netaji Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Pipulia, 
											Chandipur, etc. Most of the 
											communist peasants in these villages 
											lost their land and leaders had 
											their hand. <br>
											When Bengali refugees settled in MP, 
											Maharashtra, Andhra and Orrissa were 
											planning to launch Marichjhapi 
											agitaion, my father Pulin Kumar 
											Biswas went to Mana Camp and tried 
											to convince the refugees that it 
											will be a folly to depend on the 
											communist leaders in West Bengal. 
											Jyoti Basu had visited Vilai and ram 
											chatterjee went to mana to mobilise 
											the agitation. Since my father has a 
											very good relations with ND Tiwari 
											and KC pant, the rfugee leaders did 
											not believe him . He was the 
											president of all India Bengali 
											Refugee committe. He was mishandled 
											and was saved by police. My father 
											came back to Nainital and no refugee 
											joined this Matrichjhapi movement 
											under his influence ie UP, Bihar and 
											Assam. What happened is Marichjhapi 
											genocide by the Jyoti Basu 
											government. I also protested the 
											movement purely on ecological ground 
											as I believed that sundar Van must 
											be protected and Marichjhapi won`t 
											solve the refugee problem. My father 
											was very sad that no refugee 
											movement could be mobilised in 
											bengal and he held left responsible 
											for this.</font></p>

											<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;The 
											Left and its allies may have fought 
											for stopping use of agricultural 
											land for Special Economic Zones (SEZ) 
											but in West Bengal, Chief Minister 
											Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee says it's 
											impossible to conform to the 
											Centre's stipulation. JSW Steel, 
											which signed an MoU with the Bengal 
											government, would need around 4,800 
											acres for the 10-million tonne steel 
											plant. According to the government, 
											not more than 100 acres of farmland 
											could be acquired. However, the JSW 
											deal was an exception and in fact 
											the proposed industrial projects 
											would eat up a substantial portion 
											of agricultural land in the state. 
											Even the fertile tracts will have to 
											be sacrificed. <br>
											<br>
											The Left Front wants use of 
											multicrop land for SEZ restricted at 
											10 per cent, but Bhattacharjee says 
											departures are bound to happen in 
											Bengal.&quot;I think it is not possible 
											to apply in our state because 62 per 
											cent is agricultural land and at 
											least 70 to 80 per cent is fertile 
											land. But we'll compensate by 
											improving the productivity of land 
											we have,&quot; says Bhattacharjee. <br>
											<br>
											Singur is a case in point. While 
											dated government records show barely 
											10 per cent of the acquired 997-acre 
											plot yielded more than one crop a 
											year, villagers claim exactly the 
											opposite. <br>
											<br>
											After months of debate, government 
											officials admit productivity of land 
											had improved since records were last 
											updated, and the 10 per cent figure 
											wasn't correct.<br>
											<br>
											After Singur and Nandigram, partners 
											of the CPM have distanced themselves 
											from Bhattacharjee. And with 
											departures happening from hallowed 
											political beliefs of the Left Front, 
											building a consensus amongst allies 
											wouldn't be easy. </font></p>

											Background<br>
											Since 3 January 2007, Nandigram has 
											witnessed protests by local farmers 
											after they came to know about a 
											notification issued by authorities 
											at the neighboring Haldia port 
											identifying their lands as sites to 
											be acquired for the new chemical 
											production project. This 
											notification has since been 
											withdrawn by the West Bengal 
											government which has stated it would 
											&quot;exercise caution&quot; while going ahead 
											with the project.</font></p>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
											project reportedly requires at least 
											4,000 hectares of land for setting 
											up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) 
											which would be jointly developed as 
											a chemical hub by the state-owned 
											Industrial Development Corporation 
											and the Indonesia-based Salem group 
											of companies. Another SEZ promoted 
											by the same group is also reportedly 
											planned in the Haldia area.</font></p>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
											protests at Nandigram followed 
											unrest in Singur (West Bengal) in 
											December 2006, when opposition 
											parties and a number of farmers 
											threatened with displacement by a 
											state government move to acquire 
											farm land for a Tata Motors' 
											automobile manufacturing project 
											prompted demonstrations. The West 
											Bengal state government plans to set 
											up at least six other major

											hectares of land.</font></p>
											<p align="justify">
											<font face="Verdana" size="2">In a

											My game is red, a&nbsp; DNA analysis by 
											Sayandeb Chowdhury :<br>
											Thursday, January 11, 2007&nbsp; 23:59 
											IST<br>
											&nbsp;<b><br>
											The only inspiration for the 
											opposition in Bengal is CPI(M)'s 
											flawed past</b><br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											The game of realpolitik involves a 
											hidden streak of the unsaid and the 
											unuttered, which does not show up on 
											camera in two-second bites. But 
											certain historical junctures bring 
											to the surface those fault lines and 
											ironies. The Singur and Nandigram 
											issues have all the makings of a 
											conflict that can force open those 
											fault lines in Bengal. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											There is no certainty that anytime 
											soon, Mamata Banerjee's madness, 
											like that of King George the Fifth, 
											will surrender to the voices of 
											reason. It is similarly unlikely 
											that CPI(M) will let the Tatas run 
											away from the state like their 
											brethren did in the sixties and 
											seventies. Big capital, frightened 
											by the spectre of communism, had 
											then sought shelter in Mumbai and 
											elsewhere. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											But old cultures die hard; in Bengal 
											politics, often they don't. So in a 
											display of supreme irony, now the 
											Leftists are the flag-bearers of 
											capital and Mamata is the 
											obstructer-in-chief, eyeing the vast 
											rural base of the CPI(M). <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											The style and maybe the substance 
											have transmuted. But the culture 
											hasn't. Mamata's show of public 
											defiance and disruption, owes its 
											genealogy to the CPI(M), whose 
											cadres were well tutored in 
											disruptive and dissident tactics. 
											Mamata has only taken over from 
											where the CPM left off. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											But how and when did the CPM vacate 
											that space in the first place? Why 
											did it leave the hallowed, if 
											somewhat hollowed communist chimera 
											and embrace what, by any accounts, 
											is pure capitalism? Was it 
											externally driven ― the collapse of 
											the Soviet Union, the changing 
											economic landscape in China or 
											Vietnam ― or did it have an 
											internal, purely domestic impetus? 
											No doubt the old communist dreams of 
											those countries had helped the CPI(M) 
											dangle the carrot of a great future 
											to its followers. Bengal had seen 
											its industries vanish and the 
											impoverished population bought into 
											the CPI(M)'s grand project. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											Part of the Party's political base 
											was in the industrial wastelands 
											where people were left jobless due 
											to the flight of capital. The other 
											part were the farmers who joined the 
											CPI(M) in the hope of transforming 
											their lives; after the Green 
											revolution had bypassed them. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											To keep its rural and mofussil base 
											intact, the CPM had to show itself 
											to be anti-metropolitan, which meant 
											attacking computerisation and taking 
											English out of primary education. 
											The result? Bengal's present 
											crumbled under the weight of a 
											future that would never come. The 
											CPI(M) stood by paternalistically, 
											guarding a generation that grew up 
											totally unsure of itself and its 
											place in the world.&nbsp; <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											But, the world was changing outside 
											and with it, India was experiencing 
											convulsions, too. As other states 
											began prospering once reforms were 
											instituted, there were those in the 
											CPI(M) who realised that the myth of 
											a prosperous agrarian Bengal would 
											be unsustainable for long. To make 
											sure the state grew out of 
											stagnancy, it had to change tracks 
											and embrace speedy industrialisation. 
											Which meant a change in its party 
											culture ― the strikes, the bandhs 
											and the violence that had become 
											hallmarks of the CPM's style of 
											functioning. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											Also, by the mid-nineties, the Left 
											parties' vote share started 
											dwindling from a healthy 40 per cent 
											that it had enjoyed in the 80s. In 
											fact, at any time during the 
											nineties, a united opposition could 
											have dislodged the CPI(M). Some 
											party leaders quickly saw the 
											writing on the wall. They realised 
											that globalisation was raising 
											expectations even among its own 
											faithful. Younger Bengalis did not 
											see merit in the party's 
											anti-technology stance. There was a 
											real danger that the party would 
											become irrelevant. The future was 
											already here; there was no time to 
											lose. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was&nbsp; quick 
											on the uptake and saw that the 
											future of his party was not in 
											peddling empty aphorisms to the&nbsp; hoi 
											polloi. It was in making peace and 
											working alongside the middle class. 
											Braving the objections of his 
											colleagues, especially at the 
											centre, he has forged on, wooing 
											capital from within and outside the 
											country. The middle-class shifted to 
											him in droves. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											The danger is that he may have left 
											his traditional bases open to others 
											like Mamata, who has spotted the 
											chinks in the party's armour. Not 
											only has she studied the CPM's 
											political language carefully, she 
											has gauged ―perhaps correctly ― 
											that there are still sections in the 
											rural hinterland who may not be in 
											thrall of rapid industrialisation. 
											Like Banquo's ghost, the CPI(M)'s 
											old dreams refuse to fade away. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											Now, the poor have found solace with 
											Mamata and her ilk. Mamata on her 
											part has occupied the anti-industry 
											ground and she is finding support 
											and traction. Both sides have 
											exchanged garbs. Meanwhile, Bengal's 
											future glory seems to be in 
											permanent limbo. <br>

											Singur: The Emperors Have No Clothes<br>
											January 12, 2007<br>
											How much more will The Hindu defend 
											the Marxist Government of West 
											Bengal? For over a month, the 
											campaign to paint the Marxist 
											Government white has breached all 
											decent limits of &quot;fearless, 
											unbiased&quot; reporting. Not content 
											with the 22 pages it has everyday, 
											The Hindu also wants to use the tiny 
											&quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; column to 
											propagate or rather thrust its views 
											upon readers. Similar to the cry of 
											Chief Minister Buddhadeb 
											Bhattacharjee that since all the 
											available land is under cultivation 
											they are forced to encroach upon 
											agricultural land for 
											industrialization, The Hindu seems 
											to say that since all the available 
											space is either filled with news or 
											advertisements (or even Rs 
											13-per-Sq-cm obituaries), it has no 
											option but to forcibly intrude into 
											the only available space on the 
											paper, the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; 
											columns. <br>
											<br>
											Look at this piece that was 
											published two days ago.<br>
											<br>
											The report that six persons died in 
											clashes in Nandigram, West Bengal, 
											following rumours of land 
											acquisition for a Special Economic 
											Zone, is disturbing.&quot;Rumors&quot;? What 
											rumors? When you turn two pages you 
											find where Mr. Bhattacharjee 
											admitted that the Haldia Development 
											Authority did issue a notice to 
											acquire land and the said authority 
											is headed by a CPI(M) MP. Why 
											publish letters that are factually 
											incorrect? Incidentally, all the 
											letters are from people who are more 
											that 2000 kms from West Bengal. What 
											a representative collection of 
											letters! As if that was not enough, 
											yesterday's edition carries another 
											letter toeing the line of The Hindu 
											and coming from a non-West Bengal 
											location. The death of six persons 
											in clashes instigated by some 
											organisations in Nandigram is 
											unfortunate. The fact that these 
											organisations played up rumours of 
											land acquisition saying the West 
											Bengal Government had issued 
											eviction notices, when the reality 
											is that it has not even completed 
											the identification of lands, shows 
											their vested interest. <br>
											<br>
											The other letter in the column too 
											supports the Marxists. Readers often 
											look towards the letters to learn 
											the dissenting or the alternative 
											points of view. In the first place, 
											the reporting on the Singur issue 
											has been very one-sided. Ms. Medha 
											Patkar and Ms. Arundhati Roy, who 
											usually get lavish space, are now 
											given single-column insignificant 
											coverage. By publishing letters that 
											just mimic the articles, The Hindu 
											is forcing regular readers like me 
											to look for alternative sources of 
											news. The fine line between your 
											beliefs and the truth is always 
											sacrosanct. In this editorial, where 
											they term Mamata Banerjee's fast as 
											&quot;high-wire theatrics&quot; and 
											&quot;meaningless&quot; ,has breached that 
											line. The editorial, which also 
											commends Mr. Bhattacharjee' s 
											handling of the issue, give us an 
											FAQ on Singur. What are the key 
											facts about Singur? The State 
											Government went about acquiring the 
											land sought by Tata Motors not by 
											dispossessing the people on the 
											highly fragmented land, but by 
											seeking their consent through 
											offering compensation that was 
											significantly higher than the market 
											price. The moot issue is not the 
											price but the consent of the 
											landowners and rehabilitation and 
											that has been consciously eclipsed.<br>
											<br>
											The biggest lie that Chief Minister 
											Bhattacharjee has been repeatedly 
											telling is that the lands have been 
											acquired with the consent of the 
											landowners. But the &quot;Final Report on 
											Singur&quot;, available on the website of 
											the West Bengal Industrial 
											Development Corporation, reveals a 
											different story. Consent under 
											section 11(2) is a means of 
											involvement of the citizen in 
											determination of award. However, 
											non-submission of consent in writing
