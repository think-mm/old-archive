	Acid throwing - a serious human rights violation in Bangladesh </span></b>

	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Since the world 
	was&nbsp;created, women&nbsp;have been&nbsp;abused in many senses, physically, mentally, 
	economically and so on. </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Recent 
	statistics also show that domestic violence is present in all parts of the 
	world; the Western world is not excluded. It is imperative to establish the 
	rights of men and women fully. <br>
	<br>
	In&nbsp;third world countries, women are mostly abused and neglected&nbsp;in the name 
	of religion. As a Bangladeshi woman, I&#39;ll talk about the problem of 
	Bangladeshi women. &quot;Acid&quot; is the name of the most dangerous curse now a 
	days. Acid violence is among the grossest of human rights violations, and 
	the goal of this examination is to focus the debate and the point of 
	intervention in order to more effectively address the problem. What can be 
	cruller to a human being than destroy one&#39;s own identity? Sometimes when we 
	open a newspaper, we see some faces there which are so defiled, that it is 
	difficult to believe that those are faces of a human being. Generally the 
	women of poor class are the main victims of acid. Approximately 300 people 
	in Bangladesh experience this attack each year, and 41 percent of victims 
	are under the age of 18. People of the root level find it the cheapest and 
	easiest way to take revenge. Acid is also an available element. 78 percent 
	of reported acid violence happens to women, with the most common reasons 
	for&nbsp;attack being&nbsp;the dowry problem, the conjugal problem, the refusal of 
	marriage, the denial of sex, the rejection of romance and any kind of 
	misunderstanding in a relationship even in family quarrel. By studying these 
	cases, we see acid victims are mostly in&nbsp;the 10 – 30 age groups. Mostly when 
	women are sleeping or going out for natural necessity, acid is thrown at 
	them through&nbsp;open windows or from hiding places. A cup of acid, usually 
	sulphuric acid poured from any car battery or purchased from auto repair 
	shops, costs only a few cents, and is therefore a cheap and available 
	weapon. Some perpetrators throw acid in an attempt to obtain the victim&#39;s 
	land, believing that the family will be forced to sell their property in 
	order to pay for medical treatment. <br>
	<br>
	The most crucial part is acid attacks leave victims horribly disfigured 
	because most attacks are directed at the face in order to permanently scar 
	the victim and destroy her physical appearance. Victims don&#39;t die but they 
	burn very badly. Sometimes, not only the flesh but the bones are also melted 
	by this. Acid spreads either through the whole body or mostly in upper 
	portion of the body. Often times, the victim is left blinded, deaf or dumb. 
	This also breaks their courage to live and saps their will power&nbsp;to fight 
	against this cruel society. It seems that those who die are relieved and 
	those are alive&nbsp;die each day. They can have no normal life. Along 
	with&nbsp;physical suffering,&nbsp;acid survivors have to deal with mental trauma as 
	well. Many victims are frustrated, and some of them have suicidal 
	tendencies. They need periodic counselling by trained psychotherapists to 
	recover from the shock and frustration. Victims usually become depressed and 
	are treated as outcasts by relatives, neighbours, and friends. Not only does 
	the victim suffer, also, the whole family is suffers with her, equally, 
	both&nbsp;mentally and socially. <br>
	<br>
	Bangladesh is the country with the largest number of acid victims&nbsp;in the 
	whole world. The weak judicial system is the biggest reason for this 
	problem.&nbsp;Acid attackers mostly enjoy the poor structure of the law and also 
	enjoy the social and judicial benefits. It&nbsp;takes very long to dismiss a case 
	in Bangladesh. In year 2000 came the law under women and children custody, 
	which said that the death sentence would be the highest penalty for an acid 
	attacker. Criminals, however, take&nbsp;shelter&nbsp;in all sorts of gaps and weak 
	parts of the law and remain free. Lots of people also say there should be 
	also some regulation on selling acid. Not only should the acid thrower&nbsp;be 
	punished, but&nbsp;also the acid seller (who is selling acid without permission) 
	and also each other helpers in this purpose. Bangladesh still suffers from a 
	poorly trained police force and a backlogged court system, both rife with 
	corruption. Therefore, most perpetrators still go unpunished. If history is 
	a lesson, a marked decrease in acid attacks will not occur until the 
	Bangladeshi police and legal systems become more quick and effective, the 
	prerequisite for which is probably a revolution at the heart of the 
	Bangladeshi political system. . Due to poor promotion in the media and a 
	lack of awareness in the people, most people are not aware of the law. As 
	the legal system has not been able to hand out exemplary punishment to any 
	acid attacker so far, attackers have little to fear. And the&nbsp;media needs to 
	work more on this issue. Repeated broadcasts of punishment delivered would 
	tell the public of recourse available to victims and warn potential acid 
	attackers. </span></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Because of this 
	increasing problem, Dhaka Medical College has opened a separate &quot;Burn Unit&quot;.
	</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">
	This unit, created in the late 1990s, contains 8 beds and employs 3 plastic 
	surgeons. It was the only burn facility in this country of 140 million 
	people; therefore, it was frequently inaccessible to acid victims. But&nbsp;now 
	Bangladesh has about four other hospitals, apart from the Dhaka Medical 
	College, that can provide treatment to acid-attack victims. </span></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">There is no concrete 
	medicine for this issue. The only method is washing the attacked place by 
	using normal temperate water again and again. </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Victims 
	need long-term as well as short-term care</span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">. 
	Thanks to modern treatment facilities, cosmetic surgery is one of the 
	solutions available. But&nbsp;because it remains a costly project, most victims 
	have to wait for&nbsp;help from a welfare organization.&nbsp; Private donors have been 
	very actively helpful in supporting some of these organizations. </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Acid 
	survivors are never cured completely. Even after extensive treatment gouges 
	inevitably remain, making social reintegration and marriage very difficult</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">.</span></p>
	<p style="margin-top:13.7pt;margin-right:0pt;margin-bottom:13.7pt;margin-left:
0pt" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">The fact 
	that acid survivors can never regain their original appearance has a severe 
	impact on their social lives. It is tough for the victims to accept their 
	new identities. Moreover, the working capabilities of acid victims drop 
	significantly. Because of physical problems, such as the loss of their 
	eyesight or hearing and the sensitivity of their skin to heat and sunlight, 
	the victims can only do very limited types of jobs. Their income-generating 
	power decreases. Young victims, meanwhile, have to stop going to school. 
	Even after they have recovered, most of them cannot continue their studies 
	because of their unstable physical conditions. They thus cannot develop 
	skills that they could have fostered otherwise. </span>
	<span style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Luckily the welfare 
	organizations are doing lot more than only providing them treatment. They 
	are also taking care of their rehabilitation in this society. They are 
	trying to integrate them in&nbsp;society by providing&nbsp; training such as poultry 
	farming, handicrafts etc. The most delightful part of it is that some acid 
	survivors have shown&nbsp;considerable progress in these activities. </span></p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: Verdana">Acid 
	violence is yet another horrible chapter in the book of human rights abuses 
	in Bangladesh. One especially positive aspect of efforts against acid 
	violence among Bangladeshis, explains Dr. Morrison, &quot;Bangladeshis are 
	outright shocked and ashamed that the attacks happen here.&quot; A message must 
	be sent to society that the state genuinely considers acid violence a 
	heinous crime and that whoever takes part in the crime will be severely 
	punished. To realise this aim, Bangladesh needs efficient law enforcement 
	agencies and an effective judicial system to work together with the public 
	to bring the perpetrators to justice. </span></p>
