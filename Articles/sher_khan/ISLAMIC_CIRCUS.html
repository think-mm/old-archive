  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Once upon a 
  time there was an elephant and four blind men. They were not born blind and 
  they have seen most of the things of this world but an elephant. One day they 
  met an Elephant. The first blind man, feeling of the tusk cried, an elephant 
  is very like a spear! The second took the trunk and immediately screamed; an 
  elephant is just like a snake! The third touched the broad and sturdy side of 
  the elephant. He declared an elephant looks like a wall! The fourth seized the 
  tail and claimed an elephant is like a rope.
  <O:P></O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">The parable of 
  blind men and an elephant perfectly illustrates the method of interpreting a 
  subject matter when people are blind and/or ignorant. Often Muslims blame 
  other Muslims for not understanding real Islam. Each and every Muslim believes 
  his own version of Islam and definitely their understanding is better than 
  others. Knowledge is a powerful force that strongly influences a person. 
  Typically religious knowledge is ancient in nature and overshadows a person’s 
  mind to making him blindfolded. A person with Quranic knowledge tends to go 
  back in Stone Age whereas a person with scientific knowledge foresees the 
  future.

  </span></u></b></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Real Muslims 
  conceive Islam as a way of life. They like to live a life that was practiced 
  by the people of 7<sup>th</sup> century. Their mind is clogged with Quranic 
  dictation and Mohammad’s lifestyle. They happily follow this primeval culture 
  engulfed in brutal and barbaric behaviors. These fundamentalists deliberately 
  ignore the fundamental questions about right and wrong or fairness. Muslim 
  cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri claimed 9/11 attacks were a Jewish plot and calling 
  the
  <ST1:CITY w:st="on">
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Columbia</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>
  space shuttle disaster, “Punishment from Allah” because Christians, Jewish and 
  Hindu astronauts were aboard. It’s just another fine example of how religious 
  knowledge can make a person ignorant.<O:P> </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">These Islamists 
  used to be specialists in swords and spears when science was in its infancy. 
  In modern days they plot suicide bombing and carry a few grenades like pocket 
  change. They are the Real Muslims and easily recognizable. They look like 
  Billy goats because of their beard. (Don’t blame me. Famous Iranian&nbsp; scholar 
  Ar-Razi called Mohammad in this name.) Anyway, these Mullahs wear baggy type 
  pants and their tiny brain is covered with a cap or a turbine. This group of 
  Muslims follows the book of Quran literally and does not hesitate to kill 
  Kafirs. Producer and Director of horror movie “Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>” may 
  learn a thing or two from these Islamists.
  <O:P></O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">They are not 
  interested in this earthly life. They will do whatever it takes to reserve a 
  seat in their hallucinated heaven. The suicide bombers and Imams (Muslim 
  priest) fall in this category. They have an excellent knowledge of the Quran 
  and Ahadith. They stay away from theological wars and confine themselves in 
  the twilight zone of Islam. Beheading and raping Kafirs are their favorite 
  hobbies. They are dangerous but honestly follow Islamic rules. These Mullahs 
  do not compromise with Islamic laws. Islam prohibits eating pork, drinking 
  wine and accepting interest from invested money. These Mullahs will blow 
  themselves up if they have to eat pork. Forget about drinking and accepting 
  interest. Usually a real Muslim keeps four wives and produces a few dozen of 
  children. When Mohammad was half more than a century old, he married 9 years 
  old child Ayesha. They don’t see anything wrong in this picture and maintain 
  an aggressive “So What?” attitude.<O:P> </O:P>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><b><u>MODERN MUSLIM SCHOLARS<O:P> </O:P>
  </u></b></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Apparently our 
  Modern Muslim scholars are trying to reform Islam and represent Islam as a 
  peaceful religion. It’s a great news and their effort should be commended 
  except for the hidden agenda that they nurture. All religions have gone 
  through some type of reformation to meet the challenge of civilization. 
  Christianity faced serious obstacle a few centuries ago. Most of the western 
  countries have kicked out Church form the state. Now Church has no business 
  with the government. Even in<ST1:PLACE w:st="on" /> India, government has 
  passed several laws to hinder religious dominance. One fine example is&nbsp; “Sotidaho”. 
  In this barbaric practice, A Hindu woman would sacrifice her life when she 
  loses her husband. Also sacrificing a human body to one of those comical gods 
  or goddesses has been banned. In comparison to these examples, no Islamic 
  county has the courage to pass any law that would stop the brutal dictation of 
  Quran.</span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Is it possible 
  to reform Islam? Hypothetically, Yes. Realistically, NO! Quran, the holey book 
  of Islam is the root of all disasters. Without changing the Quran, it’s 
  impossible to reform Islam. No Muslim will dare to edit or change those weird 
  verses of the Quran. Even the most liberal Muslim will jump from an aircraft 
  without using a parachute if he is asked to change the Quran. These so-called 
  modern scholars are pretending to reform Islam but it’s only a camouflage. 
  Actually they are the under cover agents of real Islam. They are doing a much 
  better job than James Bond 007. Modern Muslim scholars vehemently object all 
  inhumane teachings of the Quran. Whenever an ex-Muslim or a non-Muslim 
  confronts them with those ugly verses, they start huffing and puffing. But 
  they don’t dare to challenge real Islamists instead they hide their tails in 
  between their legs and run faster than the cartoon character “Roadrunner”.</span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Anything in the 
  Quran that looks ugly is considered Out-of-Context. Their explanations are 
  contrary to Mullahs’ reckoning. These modern scholars write tons of Qu-fi (Quranic 
  Fiction) books to portray a peaceful Islam. They have found miracles in the 
  number 19 and working on the number 69 to discover the impact on Mohammed’s 
  personal life on his wives. They feel embarrassed of Ayesha-Mohammad situation 
  and try to increase Ayesha’s age deceitfully. One may think if these modern 
  scholars are truthful to what they preach they must have conflict with 
  Mullahs. Should not they declare an all out “Jihad” against those Mullahs and 
  ask them to stop misinterpreting Islamic teachings. Sadly, they don’t because 
  they know Mullahs are absolutely right. These Muslim scholars do not hesitate 
  to visit the same mosques that Mullahs rule and pray right behind those 
  bigots. Had they believed what they write they would have created their own 
  mosque and made their own Muslim community. These Modern scholars do not 
  practice what they preach. Actually it’s a good teamwork between 
  Fundamentalists and hypocrite scholars. These hypocrite scholars only create a 
  smokescreen to deceive western countries and innocent moderate Muslims.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">A group 
  of Half-Muslims is the follower of Real Muslims. They pray five times a day 
  robotically recite the Quran without understanding it. People from non-Arab 
  countries like
  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">India</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> ,
  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">Bangladesh</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> and
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Africa</ST1:PLACE> are this type of people. They memorize 
  the Quran like a parrot but do not understand Arabic. However, Qu-Fi books 
  written by hypocrite scholars inspire them to believe Islam as a scientific 
  religion. Any deviation from this concept is either a conspiracy of the Jews 
  or people misunderstood the meaning. Eating pork or drinking wine is strictly 
  avoided. They do not mind accepting interest of invested money and seek 
  forgiveness from Allah for this act.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Women of 
  this group use headscarf within the community but freely take it off when 
  going to work. Non-Arab Muslims are often discriminated openly when staying in 
  Arab countries. A few months back, six non-Arab Muslims were killed and burnt 
  by a Sheikh just because they dared to enter in his garden. Ironically, these 
  half-Muslims do not mind this type of inhumane behavior. When living in a 
  foreign country this half-Muslims pledge to become a citizen but their heart 
  and soul reside in the
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Middle East</ST1:PLACE> despite the fact that their root

  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">A group of 
  Mini-Muslims is desperately holding the tail of Islamic elephant and expects 
  to get a rare seat in the heaven. Majority of Muslims is of this type. 
  Occasionally they visit a mosque to attend the Friday prayer otherwise they 
  are not fond of exercising five times a day. There are three common things 
  that all groups of Muslims give credence to. First, they all respect shrewd 
  and ruthless emperor Mohammad and his imaginary idol Allah. Secondly, they 
  would never eat pork. Thirdly, they believe Islam is the solution of 
  everything. Mini-Muslims have faith in these three fundamentals and they also 
  believe all Muslims will go to heaven. Inspired by this incentive, our 
  Mini-Muslims do not like to leave Islam.<O:P> </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">This group of 
  Muslims does not mind drinking a few beers or a shot of Whisky. They do not 
  follow any of those Islamic laws. Never read the Quran or Ahadith. However, 
  they create a fertile land for hoaxes that are created by hypocrite scholars. 
  Other three groups of Muslims do not consider this group as Muslims. 
  Especially those Real Muslims hate these types of so-called Muslims. 
  Apparently Mini-Muslims look harmless and they really are kind people. Problem 
  starts when they become old and become religious. Some of them change to 
  Half-Muslim and some even downgrade themselves to Mullahs.<O:P> </O:P>

  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">Good news is 
  majority of Muslims are either Half-Muslims or Mini-Muslims. Naturally they 
  are not a direct threat to mankind as opposed to Real Muslims and Hypocrite

  and Middle-East countries are pumping billions of petro-dollars to promote 
  real Islam through Madrasas (Islamic School) and feeding hypocrite scholars. 
  Hypocrite scholars create an innocent image of Islam to keep half and mini 
  Muslims under Islamic flag. Mullahs take next step to brainwash this people 
  and convert them to Real Muslims. Can you imagine of all Muslims of this world 
  becoming Real Muslims? We are talking about a billion active suicide bombers! 
  Ain’t that scary?&nbsp;

  <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="font-family: Arial">To give a happy 
  ending, the activity of emerging ex-Muslims must be mentioned. This group of
