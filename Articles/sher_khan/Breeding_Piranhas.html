  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="blacktext1"><b><font face="Arial">300,000 
  years BCE</font></b><font face="Arial">. In a bright sunny day a few Homo 
  sapiens are preparing for hunting. These early people are hairy but not 
  slow-witted as some future archaeologists may think. Men are sharpening their 
  newly invented spears. These spears have wooden handles that will make hunting 
  easier. They have learned to stay together and invented fire that keeps their 
  cave worm. One woman is playing a flute made of a bear bone. In a future date, 
  when this astonishing flute will be discovered, it will blow away the mind of
  </font></span><font face="Arial">Jelle Atema, a Boston University biologist 
  and flute fanatic. In the corner of the cave, three men are drawing pictures 
  of animals. They are smart enough to find colors from nature. These early 
  Michelangelos are making red color from Iron oxide and black from manganese or 
  charcoal left over from cooking fires. Oils from plants and animals will be 
  added to these colors. Painting brushes made of animal hairs are as good as 
  brushes that will be used by Picasso.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Invention, Art and Music are the icons 
  of human race. People of future will proudly recall their ancestors for not 
  becoming extinct. These civilized minds of uncivilized age laid the foundation 
  of humankind.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">Year 2004 AD</font></b><font face="Arial">, 
  in a remote village of an Islamic country a group of students is chanting a 
  chorus. No, they are not singing or reciting a poem. Singing is prohibited in 
  this classroom and it’s an unforgivable sin. Sitting on years old faded rugs 
  they are memorizing verse 5 of Sura Al-Tawba<i>…..“So when the sacred months 
  have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take 
  them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush,….”.</i>&nbsp; 
  Their synchronized voice is sending a chilling message to rest of the world. 
  The only Teacher/ Principal/ Administrator of this school is Mullah Al-Sadr. 
  The stone-faced teacher is listening carefully, eyes half-closed. He is 
  holding a stick with one hand and another hand is busy brushing his long 
  beard, occasionally itching for possible lice. He never laughs. Laughing is an 
  unacceptable behavior in Islam and it’s against Mohammad’ teachings. Seldom 
  has he smiled but only a crack on his lips showed part of his dirty yellow 
  teeth. He just whipped two of his students. Reciting Quran is a serious 
  business. Any mistake may degrade the layer of heaven after death. As a 
  teacher he may have to take some responsibility too. Thinking of the 
  consequences he shivers, as if he just swallowed a rotten fish.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Time stopped here. The clock did not 
  move a minute since 7<sup>th</sup> century. These students are trained and 
  brain washed to stay in the era of Mohammad. This power hungry warrior changed 
  the course of humanity and deviated from the mainstream civilization. Blind 
  followers of this leader will remain obsessed with the ideology and make their 
  own society enveloped in hate and violence. Textbooks of this classroom are 
  Quran, Ahadith, Sirat-e-Rasul and other Islamic books, and they are in Arabic 
  only. Mullah General’s warning, “Studying English or any other language may 
  cause serious injury to Muslims’ health”. Physics, Chemistry or Calculus are 
  simply unknown subjects. No science to ponder, no sociology to uphold 
  humanistic values. There is no zeal for invention, no zest for earthly 
  life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Neither a World Map nor a Periodic 
  Table is hanging on the wall. However there is a picture of a black cube known 
  as Kaba, the holiest place on the Earth. Around the cube, spaghetti like 
  drawing reveals Allah and Mohammad’s relationship in Arabic letter. Sunni 
  section of Islam prohibits taking or displaying pictures. If the original 
  painting of Mona Lisa is presented to this Mullah, he will not smile like her, 
  rather he will save it for annual festival of burning US flags. This precious 
  painting will be used to make a nice bonfire.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">No invention. No music. No art. This 
  is real Islam. Undoubtedly, These uncivilized minds of civilized age are 
  serious threat to humanity.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">
  <span class="mstext1" style="COLOR: black">Piranhas are the </span>
  <span class="body1" style="COLOR: black">most dangerous aquatic species</span><span class="mstext1" style="COLOR: black"> 
  of the world. Like Mullahs, these Piranhas have gentle appearance but they 
  possess powerful, razor sharp teeth. Most of the Mullahs of this world live in 
  warm weather. Likewise Piranhas love to live in warm water too. These 
  bloodthirsty fishes flock to their target and strip it of all its flesh in no 
  time. This pattern of staying together and attacking a subject sadly resembles 
  the human piranhas that will be produced from Madrasas. No one would breed 
  Piranhas in his own swimming pool. Unfortunately our Islamic countries are 
  deliberately breeding human Piranhas in their own backyard. These Madrasas are 
  mostly state sponsored and produce numerous Jihadists every year. These Jihad 
  academies continue to produce an army of holy warriors loyal to real Islam.<O:P> 
  &nbsp;</O:P> </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">
  <span class="mstext1" style="COLOR: black">The Piranhas of Madrasas slowly 
  amalgamate themselves with other Muslims. Conducting prayer is their main job. 
  However Half, Mini or Hypocrite Muslims often call the adult Piranhas to 
  facilitate various religious ceremonies. These Piranhas know the art of 
  slaying and they artistically slit the throat of a cow, lamb or a goat.</span><span style="color: black"> 
  They are the experts in this traditional Islamic method and they have proven 
  their talent by slitting the throat of innocent Journalist Daniel Pearl. 
  Proudly they also circulate the picture of slitting throat at Friday’s prayer.</span><span class="mstext1" style="COLOR: black"> 
  The degree of brutality is so severe that other three types of Muslims are 
  ashamed of the Mullahs.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">
  <span class="mstext1" style="COLOR: black">If Muslims are sincerely thinking 
  of reforming Islam, should not they close the door of Madrasas and go after 
  those Piranhas?
