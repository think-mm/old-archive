  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">By
  <a href="index.html">Sher Khan</a><br>
  <br>
  </span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">
  TEN</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333"> 
  years old Asghar Hussein can carry only five bricks at a time. Brick is an 
  important element of construction in this country but builders rarely use 
  monster trucks or forklifts. Yet manpower is cheaper than engine power. There 
  are plenty of Asghar Husseins who will do the job for a few bucks anyway. &nbsp;
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Asghar 
  Hussein dumps five bricks on the pile and walks back to the truck for the next 
  load. He adjusts a piece of cloth on his head that looks like a turbine. Truck 
  driver places one brick on his head then puts another four on top of it. 
  Asghar Hussein grabs both ends of the bricks with his tiny hands and slowly 
  walks toward the construction site. He is wearing a pair of torn green shorts; 
  rest of his naked body is covered with brick dust. It’s a humid and sunny day, 
  causing everyone to sweat. The sweat runs through Asghar Hussein’s dusty body 
  making zigzag trails!&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">In a fair 
  world Asghar Hussein should have been in a classroom or in a playground, 
  playing. But Asghar Hussein is the seventh of eight brothers and two sisters. 
  His father was the helper of a truck driver. One day he fell off from the 
  truck and went to the hospital. Doctors did an emergency operation after two 
  days and no bed was available in this overcrowded hospital. He stayed in the 
  hallway of the hospital until he died. Asghar Hussein knows his father could 
  have easily been saved if he was treated properly. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">All 
  elderly brothers of Asghar Hussein live and work in different places. One of 
  his sisters left with a guy and never came back. Another seventeen years old 
  sister sleeps all day. In the evening, she whispers with different people 
  behind the slum and disappears for the night. She returns with a pale face and 
  cheap cosmetics strewed all over her face. It’s only Asghar Hussein; his 
  younger brother, one sister and his mother live in this small shade of the 
  slum. They all work to survive. Asghar Hussein never went to a school nor he 
  had a nice toy to play with.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Actually 
  Asghar Hussein does have a toy. It’s a tiny car, rusted and no wheels left. 
  This city has several spots to dump trashes but only a small trashcan stands 
  in the middle of huge pile of trashes. The city council is as corrupted as the 
  overflowed trash can and never bothers to solve this problem. Residents of 
  this city freely throw trashes all around the trashcan, which is a diamond 
  mine for Asghar Hussein and his friends. Often they find items that are 
  rejected by others but precious to them. This is where Asghar Hussein found 
  his toy, the only toy of his life.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Asghar 
  Hussein smiles imagining an excellent dinner that he will have this evening. 
  Volunteers of local Madrassa are cooking nice food and the air is filled with 
  aroma of spicy meat. They have erected a huge tent to accommodate hundreds of 
  people and cylinder like loudspeakers are hanging from those tent-poles. 
  Famous Islamic scholar Moulana Al-haj Mohammad Jalal Al-din Madani will 
  deliver speech tonight. It’s an all night party and poor people will get a 
  chance to eat some nice foods. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Asghar 
  Hussein runs after work. He will have to take a quick shower and there will be 
  a long wait in front of the municipal water tap. This is the only source of 
  water for the slum where Asghar Hussein lives in. Everyone takes shower, do 
  laundry and drink form the same tap.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Event 
  starts right after the evening prayer and serving free food to poor people. 
  Asghar Hussein barely made it on time. Mr.Kamal Arif is the Principal of local 
  college. He picks up the microphone and expresses his happiness for having the 
  great Moulana in this occasion. He is a vivid reformist of Islam and national 
  newspapers happily publish his articles. Mr. Kamal Arif often writes 
  condemning the actions of Islamic fundamentalists. But today it’s not the 
  place for singing the same song.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">After 
  introducing the Moulana, Mr.Arif bursts with anger and slams the Jews. He does 
  not talk about child labor neither he mentions about planned family. 
  Population boom of this country does not bother him at all. He has no sympathy 
  for Asghar Hussein and Co. but he painfully describes the agony of 
  Palestinians. Mr. Arif fumes with Islamic brotherhood and declares his 
  solidarity with all Muslims of the world. Keeping his shameless face straight, 
  Mr. Arif finishes his speech with a few more cursing and respectfully moves 
  the microphone towards the Moulana.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Moulana’s 
  opening speech starts with a long Sura of the Quran. His shrieking noise fills 
  the night but the whole audience listens with pin drop silence, mesmerized by 
  Moulana’s recitation. Moulana is an extremely influential person. People 
  believe him more than their political leader or any other entity. Most of the 
  people of this country live below property level, naturally majority of this 
  audience is blue color labor and they are sitting on plastic papers. At the 
  front, an area with nice carpet is reserved for respected and educated persons 
  like Kamal Arif, Chief Police Officer of this city, Government Executives and 
  rich businessmen. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Moulana 
  does not talk about child labor either, instead he recites verse 52.24 and 
  describes how pearl like boys will serve drinks in the heaven! </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Forget 
  controlling the population! Moulana clearly disagrees with the notion of birth 
  control. He brags about his beloved prophet and how he discouraged this 
  Un-Islamic act. Moulana himself owns four wives and he is a proud father of 
  twenty-two children. Two of his wives are expecting again.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Moulana 
  continues his speech with different verses of the Quran. He recites Sura Al-Waqia 
  and repeats verse 56.22 twice. It’s one of his favorite verses. Moulana 
  explains how believers of Islam will be rewarded with beautiful women in the 
  next world. Virgins with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes will be waiting at 
  the gate of the heaven. His own crude description makes him a little horny. 
  Moulana pauses for a minute; shuts his eyes and comes close to orgasm. &nbsp;
  </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">The sever 
  punishment for un-believers and Kafirs is another topic that Moulana describes 
  elaborately. However, Muslims will always have an advantage over unbelievers. 
  They may seek forgiveness from Allah and perform Haj to wipe out all of their 
  sin. Those who cannot afford to perform Haj will be excused and their earthly 
  sufferings will be compensated after death.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Chief 
  Police officer feels a bit relaxed. Criminals of this town pay him more money 
  than his usual salary. His conscious always bugs him for this heinous act. He 
  plans to buy a few more property in this city and then perform Haj to clean up 
  his sinful past.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">All 
  government officials sitting at the front row depend on bribe that 
  consistently bothers them. Mr. Kamal Arif often manages money from college 
  fund to meet his personal needs. He is also ashamed for his action of 
  reforming Islam. They unanimously plan to perform Haj and ask for forgiveness 
  from Allah. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">People 
  sitting with Asghar Hussein feel lucky for being poor. If the sufferings of 
  this earthly life assure excellent food and beautiful women after death, they 
  won’t complain. They will remain poor happily and let rich people enjoy this 
  stinking earthly life.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Leaning on 
  the tent pole, tired Asghar Hussein was listening to Moulana, half-asleep. He 
  asks himself, why Moulana does not mention about toys and milk in the heaven. 
  Asghar Hussein loves drinking milk but he cannot afford to buy this luxurious 
  drink very often. He tries to remember when was the last time he had a glass 
  of milk? &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">No one 
  cares for little Asghar Hussein! Moulana does not care! His Allah is too busy 
  with heavenly Houries. Corrupted government of this country has nothing to 
  offer. Intellectuals like Kamal Arif are seized by Israel-Palestine conflict 
  and Asghar Hussein’s problem does not shake their ego. Businessmen are happy 
  to having cheap child labor. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: #333333">Moulana 
  keeps entertaining his audiences with fables and takes them to a fantasyland 
  of heaven and hell. Little Asghar Hussein falls sleep, griping his only toy 
  with one hand. Sleek moonlight brushes off Asghar Hussein’s bare body and 
  wishes she could to do something for this little boy! </span></td>
