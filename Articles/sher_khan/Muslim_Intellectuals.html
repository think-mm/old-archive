  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I am not an Intellectual or a 
  professional. I am not a doctor, engineer or an academic. Honestly, I am not a 
  writer either. As you will go through this article, you may find several 
  grammatical errors and lack of a scholar’s comments. However, there should not 
  be any spelling mistake except for non-English words. Kafir (Unbeliever), Bill 
  Gates invented Microsoft Office Words and added only English words in spelling 
  check. Unlike Quranic miracles this wonder of science helps me a lot. As long 
  as you understand what I meant, please don’t complain. I am a simple man. I 
  believe, right is right and wrong is wrong. I believe truth is one and only, 
  whereas untrue have numerous colors and faces. I do not believe what I read. I 
  use my own judgment and think pragmatically. I use the golden rules of logic 
  and reason to convince myself. Aristotle once said, &quot;Plato is dear to me, but 
  dearer still is truth.&quot;<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">O ye who read, behold! I am here not 
  to write my biography. I am not a famous or a pious person that my biography 
  will be an impressive one.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Lately, I am trying to understand our 
  Muslim Intellectual’s mind. They attain highest degrees from Universities and 
  they are the experts in their areas. People like me should be admiring their 
  intelligence and knowledge. With due respect, I don’t understand how they 
  comprise religion with their philosophy, work ethics, subject matters and 
  their belief. Precisely, I am talking about our great (!) religion Islam.&nbsp;<O:P>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 588: 
  Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man came to the Prophet 
  and said, &quot;My brother has some abdominal trouble.&quot; The Prophet said to him 
  &quot;Let him drink honey.&quot;…… then said, &quot;Allah has said the truth, but your 
  brother's abdomen has told a lie.&quot; So he made him drink honey and he was 
  cured.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I have not seen any doctor prescribing 
  honey for abdominal pains. Why not the Muslim doctors follow these easy 
  solutions!&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 582:&nbsp; 
  Narrated Abu Huraira:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The Prophet said, &quot;There is no disease 
  that Allah has created, except that He also has created its treatment.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 591:

  is healing for all diseases except As-Sam.' Aisha said, 'What is As-Sam?' He 
  said, 'Death.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Can you imagine! How these doctors and 
  pharmaceuticals companies have ripped us off? All these pharmaceuticals 
  companies from the west made big money just selling black cumin in their 
  drugs!<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 596: 
  Narrated Um Qais bint Mihsan:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I heard the Prophet saying, &quot;Treat 
  with the Indian incense, for it has healing for seven diseases; it is to be 
  sniffed by one having throat trouble, and to be put into one side of the mouth 
  of one suffering from pleurisy.&quot; …….</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 629: 
  Narrated Abu Huraira:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The Prophet said, &quot;He (a Muslim) who 
  dies of an abdominal disease is&nbsp; a martyr, and he who dies of plague is a 
  martyr.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 631: 
  Narrated 'Aisha:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">During the Prophet's fatal illness, he 
  used to recite the Mu'auwidhat (Surat An-Nas and Surat Al-Falaq) and then blow 
  his breath over his body. When his illness was aggravated, I used to recite 
  those two Suras and blow my breath over him and make him rub his body with his 
  own hand for its blessings.&quot; …..</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Volume 7, Book 71, Number 632:Narrated 
  Abu Said Al-Khudri:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Some of the companions of the Prophet 
  came across a tribe amongst the tribes of the Arabs……the chief of that tribe 
  was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said, ..&quot;Have you got any 
  medicine with you or anybody who can treat with Ruqya…... One of them (the 
  Prophet's companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and gathering his 
  saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his 
  people presented the sheep to them, but they said, &quot;We will not take it unless 
  we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&quot; When they asked him, he smiled and 
  said, &quot;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? Take it (flock of 
  sheep) and assign a share for me.&quot;<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I am sure no Muslim doctor practices 
  this way. It’s a wonder, how they deal with their faith in their professional 
  life?&nbsp;<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">It’s well known that
  <ST1:CITY w:st="on">
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Darwin</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>
  's theory of evolution has a big time enmity with Quranic explanation. As a 
  matter of fact, Saudi Universities don't teach these theories. They even 
  banned Pokemon cards due to the same reason. Everyone knows about this 
  contention so I am not going to quote anything on this issue but I like to 
  remind our Muslim intellectuals that clash between science &amp; religion is 
  inevitable. It's a deadly conflict. These two cannot prosper together.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&quot;Where knowledge ends, religion 
  begins.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Benjamin Disraeli]<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We would never get Archimedas’s 
  principle of buoyancy or basic laws of hydrostatics, if he was not born before 
  Islamic age. Imagine him running in the street of an Islamic country naked and 
  shouting “eureka” “eureka”. He sure would have been beheaded before he could 
  convey his discovery.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&quot;Say to the believing men that they 
  should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater 
  purity for them: and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do.&quot;<br>
  [Al-Qur’an 24:30]&nbsp;<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Most of the real scientists and 
  philosophers do not believe any religion. They cannot afford to limit their 
  thinking with religious guidelines. Here is an interesting report.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Speaker, a new report says only 
  7% of scientists believe in God. That is right. And the reason they gave was 
  that the scientists are super smart. Unbelievable. Most of these absent-minded 
  professors cannot find the toilet.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; [Congressman James Traficant, 
  August 3, 1998. House record page H6885]<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Both scientists and prophets live in a 
  state of meditation. The difference is, one meditates to find the truth and 
  the other pretends to find God. According to famous psychiatrist Thomas Szasz.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&quot;If you talk to God, you're praying; 
  if God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; [Thomas Szasz (b. 1920),
  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">U.S.</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:COUNTRY-REGION>
  psychiatrist.The Second Sin,&quot;Schizophrenia&quot; (1973)]<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">To believe, or not to believe, that’s 
  the question? If you believe, your mind will work like a puritan. Religious 
  teachings will encircle all your knowledge. No matter how many books you read, 
  your knowledge is limited. It will not go beyond the textbook. Your thinking 
  process is a puddle of water. If you do not believe, limit of your thinking is 
  unbounded. Whatever you read, you challenge, you think and you look for 
  something new. Your thinking process will roar like waves of ocean and 
  thoughts will erupt like volcanic expulsion. Only then, another Einstein may 
  emerge from our Muslim (I mean, ex-Muslim) community.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Last few decades, a new trend of Islam 
  is going on. Some scholars are trying to prove that Quran is scientific. Sad 
  part is, most of our Muslim intellectuals have joined these flock. All these 
  claims are so childish that only a 2nd grader can be fooled or a Muslim who 
  deliberately desires to be fooled. So far, no one has invented anything out of 
  Quran. Emphatically, there is no Allah or God monitoring our actions. If there 
  were one, he would be laughing so loud that whole earth would start shaking 
  and may have caused a major disaster.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&quot;All religion, my friend, is simply 
  evolved out of fraud, fear, greed, imagination, and poetry.&quot;[Edgar Allan Poe]<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;I hear, Islamic scholars are 
  scratching their heads to understand the meaning of a Quranic verse &quot;Alif Lam 
  Mim&quot;. I will not be surprised if one of them come up with a solution that 
  Einstein salvaged E=MC² out of &quot;Alif Lam Mim&quot;. However, these scholars are 
  working hard to relate scientific inventions to Quran but they can not invent 
  anything out of Quran.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Truth is universal. Good deeds are 
  indisputable. Only bad things need to be defended. If a student excels in all 
  areas, he is courteous and never smokes or takes drugs. His parents have 
  nothing to defend. They will be proud to tell everyone about his achievement. 
  Now if he is taking drugs and doing not so good in school, then his parents 
  have two choices. (1) They can be truthful and discuss with others to cure the 
  problem. (2) They can deny, they can lie and they can defend him with all kind 
  of lame excuses, ignoring the fact that something should be done to solve the 
  problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our modern Islamic scholars have taken the later 
  approach instead of trying to cure Islamic disease. They are dedicated to 
  establish Islam as a religion of peace! Their tenacity can only be compared 
  with Don Quixote's determination who was adamant to fight with the windmill. 
  Quiet a few Muslim intellectuals are dancing like puppets along with those 
  quack Islamic scholars.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Is there a Muslim scientist or an 
  Islamic country that has invented something significant in the last century? 
  Is there any prominent Muslim Scholar who did something meaningful for 
  mankind? All Islamic countries are sedated with Islamic opium.&nbsp; Most of them 
  are fighting with unbearable poverty and misery.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Marx saw religion as &quot;the sigh of the 
  oppressed creature . . . the opium of the people, which made this suffering 
  bearable.&quot; [Quoted in A History of God, Karl Marx, German political 
  philosopher and economist (1818-1883).]</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Those who have petro-dollars, they are 
  living in a luxurious life better than paradise. They are spending tons of 
  money to promote Islam but nothing for scientific invention. Is there an 
  environment for research or scientific studies in Islamic countries? Is there 
  any churches, Sanagogues or temple in
  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Saudi Arabia</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:COUNTRY-REGION>
  ? Can people from different faith and community live freely? Even a moderate 
  Muslim would not feel comfortable in the strict religious guidelines! Now, 
  look at western countries. There are hundreds of mosques and several Muslims 
  are preaching Islam profusely. Only
  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">USA</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:COUNTRY-REGION>
  alone has over 1000 mosques. Although it’s an unfair situation, I am not 
  concerned with the number of mosques or churches. They are equally dangerous 
  for mankind. Question is who is loosing in this game? All Islamic countries 
  are too busy to protect the chastity of Islam. Whereas, western countries are 
  encouraging people from all faith or no faith to live and think freely. This 
  approach results in a dynamic economy with the help of diversified community. 
  Undoubtedly, this strategy also helped to flourish science, technology and 
  civilization. Funny thing is, most of the Muslim intellectuals who live in 
  western countries are still in the nutshell of their Islamic creed.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Science, technology and philosophical 
  thoughts have changed so rapidly without Muslim's contribution that we are far 
  behind from the main stream. We need to change our beliefs. In old paradigm, 
  the “others” were our enemy. In new paradigm the “others” should be our 
  benchmark.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Applaud to all the intellectuals and 
  scholars who did not have any religious affiliation. Voltaire, Shelley, Mark 
  Twain, Thomas Edison, Bernard Shaw, Darwin, Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein, 
  Ernest Hemingway and so many others rejected religion to find the truth and 
  think rationally. They are the lighthouses for the mankind. I hope our Muslim 
  Intellectuals and scholars will follow their path and enlighten their 
  intelligence with the light of the truth.</font></XBODY></td>
