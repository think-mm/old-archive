  </O:P>
  </span><b><br>
  -Samuel Clemens &quot;Mark Twain&quot;<O:P /> &nbsp;<O:P /></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In Spanish legend, Don 
  Juan was a charismatic hero but a licentious rogue who seduced many women. 
  Based on this fictional character, Spanish author Tirso de Molina wrote a play 
  “The Seducer of Seville”. In this play, Don Juan seduces the daughter of 
  knight Don Gonzalo.&nbsp; He invites Don Juan to a duel but Don Juan killed him. 
  The complex personality of Don Juan has fascinated many writers and composers. 
  George Bernard Shaw, Moliere, Mozart and Lord Byron interpreted this knotty 
  character differently in their masterpieces.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the 7<sup>th</sup> 
  century of Arabia, there was another Don Juan whose alluring leadership and 
  unique controlling power made a history. His triumphant but sadistic ideology 
  was so powerful that it would haunt people of whole world for centuries to 
  come.
  <O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In his childhood, Don 
  was deprived from motherly affection. For an unknown reason another lady 
  raised him. When he grew up, he took a job of commission agent. Khadijah, a 
  mid-age lady who happened to be his boss fell in love with this good-looking 
  guy. She earned a substantial amount of wealth from two of her previous 
  husbands. Although 15 years younger than Khadijah Don did not want to miss the 
  opportunity. Some cartoon films have characters with dollar sign sparkling on 
  their eyes. Likewise Dinar sign sparkled in Don’s eyes too. So, one day they 
  got married. Besides the financial gain, he also found motherly affection 
  along with natural passion. Nevertheless, he was known for his 
  trustworthiness. One day he claimed that messenger of God spoke to him and he 
  was scared to death. This scariness could be due to his first big lie. It’s 
  unknown whether he found a religious book Torah and decided to play the same 
  game that was played by former prophets. Some people say he could not read or 
  write but this claim may not be of any importance.
  <O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">After Khadijah passed 
  away, Don faced serious baby sitter problem. He could not go out and raid the 
  caravans with small children. His friends found fifty yrs old widow. Her name 
  was Saudah Bint Zama. She was perfect for Don. She could take care of the kids 
  and would not ask much from Don. She was very generous. Later on, when Don had 
  plenty of beautiful women and everyone had to wait for her turn to get Don’s 
  company, Saudah gave her turn to Aisha being unable to handle this lustful 
  man.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By now, Don has gained 
  more power and tired of tasting old women. He decided to marry a young girl. 
  Now the question is, how young? His friend Abu Bakr had a little girl name 
  Aisha, She was only six years old and obviously had no idea of this grandpa 
  like old man is planning to do. He did marry her anyway and took her to bed 
  when she was nine years old. She became very outspoken when grew up. Aisaha 
  was extremely jealous and did not like the way other women offered themselves 
  to Don. She asked, “Does a woman offer herself?”&nbsp; To her dismay, Don’s 
  imaginary friend Allah sent a revelation to justify his action, “You may defer 
  any of them you wish and take to yourself any you wish, and if you desire any 
  you have set aside no sin is chargeable to you.” Indeed, Aisha was very 
  outspoken and she did not hesitate to comment, ”It seems to me that your lord 
  hastens to satisfy your desire.” It does not take a MIT graduate to understand 
  that Aisha meant sexual desire.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Don wanted to try 
  something challenging. Hafsa was the daughter of Don’s friend Umar. She was 
  stubborn and well known for haughty attitude. Her first husband died in a 
  battlefield. When Umar asked Uthman to marry his daughter, Uthman panicked and 
  refused. Don took the challenge and married her to enjoy a voluptuous but 
  stubborn lady.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Next, Don married Zainab; 
  She was a widow also. Her husband died in the battle. This marriage did not 
  last that long. She died after a few months. She was about 30 years old.<O:P> 
  &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Umm Salamah, another 
  wife of Don did not want to marry him. She was in deep love with her husband. 
  Although he died in a battle, Umm Salamah did not want to marry anymore. She 
  was proud of her two children and memory of departed husband. However, Don was 
  persistent. Not for a date but to marry her. She made some excuses, I’m very 
  jealous, I have children and I am old. Don laughed because she was younger 
  than him. Finally she had to give up and marry him.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Marilyn Monroe has a 
  famous picture. Her skirt became uncontrollable from an unexpected wind and 
  she is trying to manage it with a mischievous smile. Almost same thing 
  happened when Don saw Zainab Bint Jahsh, wife of his adopted son. She was 
  dressed in a relax manner when Don saw her unexpectedly. His heart jumped as 
  if a teen-age boy found a PLAYBOY magazine for the first time in his life. 
  Zaid, adopted son of Don knew what’s going on and offered to divorce his wife 
  and allow Don to marry her. But it was not that easy. Marrying the wife of own 
  or adopted son is not a descent behavior. It definitely caused some uproar 
  among the followers of Don. So he picked up his spiritual phone and called his 
  imaginary friend,” Hey Allah. Help me. Send some verses.” Allah answered, ”No 
  problemo. One revelation coming up.” So, it did. Don was able to nail his 
  adopted son’s wife without that much trouble. Actually, Allah went out of the 
  box and took the initiative to guarantee on behalf of Don.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Don raided Banu Mustaliq 
  tribe and captured 200 camels, 5000 goats and captives of about two hundred 
  families. When this group of bandits distributed their spoils, she fell to the 
  lot of Thabit ibn Qais ibn Shammas. She was exceptionally beautiful and caught 
  Don’s eye. He did not waste time to propose her and married right away. 
  Outspoken A’isha made a nice comment, As soon as I saw her at the door of my 
  apartment, I took a dislike to her, and for I know that the Prophet would see 
  her as I saw her.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Marrying Umm Habibah was 
  not a colorful event. She was married to Ubaid Allah ibn Jahsh. This gentle 
  man decided to become Christian and Umm Habibah became alone. Don proposed and 
  married her.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Safiyah bint Huyeiy ibn 
  Akhter was born in Medinah, She belonged to the Jewish tribe of Banu ‘I-Nadir. 
  Don kicked out this tribe from Medina and they settled in Khaiber. When Don 
  became powerful and had no one to fight with he decided to visit Khaiber and 
  kill some people. He raided Khaiber successfully and captured a good number of 
  captives. Safiyah was beautiful. Her father and husband got killed in this 
  raid. After a brief marriage ceremony Don took her to his tent. Abu Ayyub was 
  one of Don’s mercenaries. He strolled all night long and guarded the tent. Don 
  asked him about this special attention. He answered, I was afraid for you with 
  this young lady. You had killed her father, her husband and many of her 
  relatives, and till recently she was an unbeliever. I was really afraid for 
  you on her account. Don was very pleased. He prayed for him and immediately 
  fax a thank you note to Allah.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Maimunah was another 
  wife of Don. Her husband divorced Maimunah bint al-Harith. She was married to 
  Abd al-Uzza for the second time but he died. On the initiation of her sister 
  she was married to Don.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">These were the eleven 
  wives of Don that are recognized by most of the scholars. However, His lust 
  for women was limitless and there are other incidents that prove him as an 
  extremely libido person.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In one occasion, Don 
  went to visit his wife Hafsa’s house and saw Mariah the captive of Hafsa. He 
  wanted her so bad that he failed to hide his desire. Don had allotted time for 
  each wife. He deprived his scheduled wife and took Mariah to bed. 
  Unfortunately his wife Hafsa caught him. Hafsa talked to Aisha and both of 
  them revealed this incident to others. Don was very upset and promised not to 
  see any of his wives for a month.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Quiz of the day.<O:P> &nbsp;</O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Do you know the real 
  name of Don?&nbsp;</span></p>
