  <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="index.html">
  Sher Khan</a></span></h3>
  <h3 style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Typically 
  Muslims are allergic to USA and Israel. They can’t stop sneezing if smell 
  America and Israel brings migraine headache. They cannot tolerate America’s 
  friendly attitude towards Israel. Invading Afghanistan was illegal. Attacking 
  Iraq was a blunder. Their tears make flashflood thinking of the innocent 
  children that were killed during the war. Good gesture! With the exception of 
  the double standard they practice. Whenever non-Muslims trouble a Muslim, 
  Islamic brotherhood boils with rage. But they remain awfully quiet when 
  Muslims kill Muslims en masse. They don’t care when more innocent children die 
  because of malnutrition and poverty in their own motherland. No objection is 
  raised when Jews children are bombed and split into pieces. They scream when 
  Ariel Sharon kills civilians but they don’t have the guts to critique Mohammad 
  for slaughtering 700 civilian Jews within a few hours. (Sirat Rasul Allah, Ibn 
  Ishaq)</font></span></h3>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">When Milosevic becomes a nutcase and starts 
  killing Muslims, USA bombs Serbia for 79 days. Muslims neither give credit nor 
  cry for the casualties. When Hitler goes out of control and America sacrifices 
  her own people to control the monster, Muslims don’t care. Mohammad is dear to 
  Muslims as Buddha to Buddhist. When Talibans destroy World’s largest statue of 
  Buddha, no Muslim stops them. When Osama kills Americans, some Muslims claim 
  it’s a Jewish conspiracy, some want proof, some shelter him and most of them 
  silently support him. America had to bribe some countries to go after Osama.
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Surely USA is the only superpower of the 
  world. For the best interest of the country America will try anything that 
  will magnify her strength. And that’s patriotism. If it becomes necessary to 
  invade another country to protect the people of America then why should she 
  hesitate to do so? Just to make it politically correct America may use 
  pretexts such as freedom, human rights etc. but there is nothing wrong if 
  situation necessitates to invade a country or help another country to ensure 
  safety. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Is America always right? No! America made 
  several mistakes in the past. Attacking Vietnam was a mistake. Supporting 
  Pakistan when Bangladesh was struggling for independence was a mistake. Not 
  long ago Slavery was a common practice and racial discrimination was 
  prominent.&nbsp; But America learns her lesson from previous mistakes and citizens 
  of this country do not hesitate to protest when it’s wrong. It’s a country 
  where differences of opinion are not only permitted but also encouraged. Not 
  even the President of the US is spared from criticism. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">In a world of “Haves” and “Have-nots” Islamic 
  countries make the majority of the later group. People of this world barely 
  can provide their food. Children starve and are lucky to have one meal a day. 
  Ignorance and lack of education cause population boom. A few rich people enjoy 
  everything without any guilt. Whether it’s through trading or plain financial 
  aids almost all Islamic countries are dependent on USA . Foreign Ministers of 
  poor Islamic countries make frequent trips to Washington with a beggar’s 
  basket and rich Islamic countries beg for technical support. Upon receiving 
  the help, citizens of recipient countries ungratefully hate America . In their 
  twisted way of thinking America ’s help is out of self interest so it does not 
  count. They bring together colorful protests against America and wish her 
  destruction. Burning an effigy of current US president along with US flags 
  becomes a ceremonial event. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">There is no such thing as free lunch. Why 
  America should help someone and expect nothing in return? Despite the 
  misconception of the Muslims, USA likes to see other countries are 
  flourishing. Notwithstanding Muslims believe USA and Israel are trying to stop 
  the development of Islamic countries; and of course everything is Jewish 
  conspiracy. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">USA is a giant economic machine. Natural 
  resources, labor and technology are the ingredients of an economic system. A 
  good management system puts together all those ingredients and produces goods 
  and services. Other than a little shortage of labor, USA has all three 
  ingredients and constantly refining its management style. As this economic 
  machine gets bigger and stronger more goods and services are produced and 
  bigger markets are needed. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">When USA enjoys a whopping $36,000 GDP Per 
  Capita, this index in most of the Islamic countries shamefully range from $500 
  to $2000. If other countries prosper economically, their per capita income 
  will grow. They will also be able to buy more US products. It’s a win-win 
  situation for both sides. Its true USA may not want them to build military 
  power but she will always welcome the economic development of other 
  countries.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">In World War II Germans lost 3.8 million <u>
  civilians</u> and Japan lost 380,000 including Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Their 
  economic infrastructures were totally destroyed and they accepted the defeat 
  courageously. America and allies smashed these two countries and then helped 
  to rebuild them. Billions of dollars in financial aid were poured in and the 
  people of theses two countries did not waste a minute to shape up their 
  homeland. No suicide bombers were produced, nor did they destroy any industry. 
  This is called patriotism. Now Japan has the largest currency reserve in the 
  world, at more than $800-billion. In today’s world, economic power can be as 
  lethal as military power. German has regained its strength just like before. 
  Within 50 years, enmity with USA is gone and foes have become friends. </span>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black">After invading Iraq, USA has 
  spent about 20 billion dollars to rebuild the country. This is almost 4 years 
  of budget for some poor countries. Instead of rebuilding the country Iraqis 
  are blowing up their own pipelines and killing American civilian contractors. 
  This is called Islamic patriotism. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Palestine issues sway the whole Islamic world 
  but no one cares to see the other side of the coin! There are more fanatics 
  among Muslims and Jews than any other religion. Both parties are extremely 
  sensitive to their origin and the fairy tales that they made. Let’s imagine 
  Ka’ba, the holy place of Muslims is invaded by Christians and all Muslims are 
  forced to leave Mecca and Medina . Don’t you think Muslims will try to regain 
  these places even after thousands of years? Same thing happened to Jews. They 
  are obsessed with Jerusalem because their root belongs here. In 967 B.C.E, 
  King Solomon built temple of Beit ha-Midkash. More than 1500 years before 
  Mohammad was born. History played its unforgiving role over the centuries but 
  Jews did not forget their religious roots. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Technically Jerusalem is not a very important 
  holy place for Muslims. In the beginning Muslims used to pray facing Jerusalem 
  but Mohammad changed this direction to Mecca. One day Allah summoned Mohammad 
  to see him. Mohammad jumped on his broom, and off he went. Supposedly he had 
  to stop at Jerusalem to answer nature’s call. Since then Jerusalem became 
  another holy spot for Muslims. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Now both Muslims and Jews want their 
  Jerusalem back. Muslims already have their Mecca and Medina where non-Muslims 
  are prohibited but that’s not enough. They need more materials to fantasize 
  their myth. A common belief of Muslims is Palestinians were kicked out from 
  Israel overnight. The truth is Jews slowly bought the lands from Palestinians 
  and the shortsighted Palestinians did not realize what’s coming in future. Now 
  Jews are ready to share this land with Muslims but Palestinians won’t 
  compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Despite the controversial issue Muslims can 
  learn a lot from Jews. America showers Israel with billions of dollars but 
  does not help with troops. Is it the tiny Israel with limited manpower that is 
  a threat to Arabs? Either it’s their will or patriotism that made them 
  powerful or Allah must have become a Jew and supports Israel ! </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">I know. I know. Muslim readers of this 
  article are stomping their feet and calling me all kind of names…. “Bootlicker 
  of America”, “Kissing America’s rear end”,&nbsp; “American slave”, “Israeli agent” 
  etc. etc. Thank you! It’s a good sign! Anger is the first step of 
  enlightenment. When you are done with cursing please drink a glass of cold 
  water and think what you can do for your own country. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">In order to change the economic turmoil of 
  Islamic countries different options should be taken into account </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"><b>First</b>, we can continue what we are 
  doing now. Beg for donation then turn around and show the middle finger.
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Second</b>, if the first option seems to 
  be dishonorable we can boycott America and all Kafir countries. Now we
  <span style="color:black">can hate them as much as we want. We may have to use 
  stones to make a fire and wear tree hide. At least we will have no guilty 
  conscience.</span> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Third</b>, we can create an environment 
  where America and other countries would be eager to invest in our countries 
  and help. It will be a fair business and most honorable thing to do. We help 
  them and they help us. Let Israel and Palestinians solve their own problem. 
  Let Iraqis build their own country. We will dedicate ourselves to our own 
  homeland. We may have to confine all of our Mullah piranhas in a bar or a 
  nightclub and thus make our countries “Jihadist” free. Countries should not be 
  called Islamic and governments must be isolated from Islamic plague. Also a 
  strong and positive public opinion must be maintained. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">To obtain help it’s imperative to build a 
  case. Imagine a person on a raft is floating in the middle of an ocean. He has 
  some flares and a semi-automatic rifle. What should he use when he sees an 
  airplane is coming to rescue him, the flares or the semi-automatic rifle? Our 
  Islamic countries are using semi-automatic rifle along with annoying verbal 
  abuse to get the attention of America!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question # 1: <b><i>Who created 
  this type of biased anti-American sentiment and the public opinion?</i></b>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question # 2: <b><i>Who can 
  ignite a renaissance to change it?</i></b> </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">A simple answer to both questions is “<span style="text-transform:uppercase">Muslim 
  Intellectuals”</span>. Ah! Intellectuals! I always have problem spelling this 
  lengthy word! </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">There are certain species that habitually 
  imitate others. Our Muslim Intellectuals are comfortably sitting on the 
  branches of an Islamic tree, <span style="color:black">waging</span> their 
  long Islamic tails and imitating each other. They all are tuned to the same 
  frequency. These intellectuals dare to solve economic problems with the help 
  of Quranic transcription. Some solicit barter system and some Psychology 
  professors find the pattern of human behavior in the Quran. Geology, 
  Oceanology, Biology, Anthropology and all types of terminologies are found in 
  this miraculous book. Finding economic and scientific solution from Quran is 
  like designing a spaceship from a cave drawing. They even create hoax stories 
  like Neil Armstrong became a Muslim after he heard the Islamic call to prayer 
  in the moon. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">When Half and Mini Muslims are petrified by 
  the ferocity of Mullah Piranhas, they helplessly seek guidance from Muslim 
  Intellectuals. The majority of the Muslim intellectuals are also Modern 
  Islamic scholars. They exploit this situation cleverly. These Muslim 
  Intellectuals own giant retail stores of Islamic opium. They have all kinds of 
  books that explain Islam deceitfully. Wrapped in sugarcoated capsules this 
  slow-poisoning opium is well received by general Muslims.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Mostly these Intellectuals are busy fixing 
  the holes in Islam and defending Mohammad. I admit it’s a daunting task. No 
  one in his right mind would be a defense lawyer of Genghis Khan, Hitler, 
  Stalin or Mohammad. Anyway, they spend the rest of their free time making a 
  case against Israel and America . They care more about Palestinians than their 
  own country and create a public opinion of hate and bitterness. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">It’s true, Islam is not the only cause of 
  misery for Islamic countries but it certainly works as catalyst and strongly 
  influences other factors such as unstable political situation, corrupted 
  government and ignorance. Seduced by Islamic opium, citizens of Islamic 
  countries cannot think of becoming industrialized nations. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-family: Arial">Only Muslim Intellectuals can steer the 
  biased public opinion to a positive direction and help building prosperous 
  countries. Dropping the Islamic tail will help them to see and show the real 
  face of Islam. Cured from Islamic disease and armed with secular thinking our 
  intellectuals can definitely change the world. </span></p>
  <p style="line-height: 150%">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">We need to change our 
  attitude towards other countries and see the world through a
  <span style="color:black">different prism.</span> As it says, we have no 
  control over the wind but we can always adjust the sail to keep our boats 
  floating.</span></td>
