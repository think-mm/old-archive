          some&nbsp; Americans/Westerners' are against the war, they are real

          <p>Applying the same argument, when we consider:</p>
          <p>-the genocide of North America<br>
          -the death of 3 million Vietnamese<br>
          -the ravaging of Africa<br>
          -the US supported terrors in Latin America<br>
          -the dispossession of the Palestinians</p>
          <p>we must consider that Europe and her offspring America has much
          atrocities to apologies for. Therefore the current self serving
          proclamation by Bush et.al about freedom and all that jazz has to be viewed
          with skepticism. People are against the war for various reasons. A
          large number of them are against the war because they are finally
          waking up to the fact that their government lies to them.</p>

          compensation.</p>
          <p>b) Introducing Osama Bin Laden to Afghanistan SIX MONTHS BEFORE the
          Soviets were to come in. Osama was introduced to provoke Soviets to
          enter Afghanistan. At that time the Government in Afghanistan had
          women ministers.</p>
          <p>c) Overthrowing Mossadeq- the secular prime minister of Iran in a
          coup which brought in the brutal dictatorship of the Shah and then saw
          the political opposition coalesce around the Mullahs.</p>
          <p>d) Overthrowing the secular and democratic Sukarno of Indonesia and
          replacement by Suharto who undertook a genocide in East Timor.</p>

          <p>This is the &quot;white men's burden&quot; argument. This was used
          for the brutal colonisation and impoverishment and genocide in most of
          the world.<b> It will be much better if the &quot;civilized&quot;
          world refrain from interfering in other countries affairs. Each
          country will find their own solution</b>. Also I hope that you know
          about the Eishenhower doctrine which promised that US will defend
          Saudi Arabia as if it is its own territory- this of course meant
          protection for a feudal and corrupt and fundamentalist ruling monarch
          and his family.</p>
          <p>In Afghanistan there is an organisation called RAWA (Revolutionary
          Association of Women of Afghanistan). In Taliban times they used to go
          inside Taliban controlled areas and educate and organise Afghan women.
          Their leader Meena was captured by Taliban and executed. <b>When US
          declared its intention to bomb Afghanistan, RAWA opposed it. RAWA said
          that opposition and resistance to Taliban should grow up from within
          Afghanistan. </b>It was ignored. After the war, RAWA was never
          involved in the discussions about the future of Afghanistan. So much
          for the noble intentions of the West and their commitment for lofty
          ideals like women's rights. Let us also not forget that Taliban was
          supplied arms by the US through the ISI of Pakistan.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">I really don't understand the meaning of the
          above statement. Firstly are we talking about growth in absolute
          numbers- then I am sure many examples can be found as there is a
          general rise in population level. Are you talking about percentage
          growth? If so then is percentage growth an indicator of
          absence/presence of discrimination. In India the small community of
          Parsis are declining with falling birth rate. Nobody will argue that
          Parsis are discriminated against in India.

          <p class="MsoNormal">Islam- like other great faiths- is a highly
          nuanced religion and has a highly nuanced history. During the
          conquering of Spain by Isabella and Fernandez, many Jews left Spain
          and came to settle in the middle east in muslim ruled areas. They were
          the forefathers of Sephardic jews. If you look at our own land
          (Bengal) you would find that Hindus and Muslims had coexisted here for
          thousands of years. The Muslim Nawabs had plenty of Hindu high
          officers. Look at Chaitanya Charitamrita.&nbsp; Kazi talking to
          Chaitainya:

          <p class="MsoNormal">We need to oppose communal politics in Indian
          subcontinent but that does not mean that we should swallow the Western
          propaganda hook line and sinker. Actually the West (or the US) has
          never had much problem with fundamentalist Muslim rulers like the King
          of Saudi Arabia. On the other hand it had undermined secular Muslim
          leaders like Nasser of Egypt, Sukarno of Indonesia and Mossadeq of
          Iran.

          <p class="MsoNormal">Are you at all aware of the doings of the
          conquistadores in South America? Also look up A peoples history of the
          United States by Howard Zinn. Especially look for the part where they
          killed 10% of the people of Phillipines in order to &quot;civilize and

          <p>I would be curious to know whether that means supporting the first
          &quot;war against terrorism&quot; launched by Ronald Regan and which
          devastated Latin american countires.</p>
