          <p>Dear Friends Mukto-Mona Group,</p>
          <p><br>
          I think most of you are familiar with the idea of <font color="#008000"><b>New
          Islam Movement</b></font>. I was<br>
          working on the structure of Movement. Finally, it was announced
          formally<br>
          last month in Toronto Canada. Now, I say welcome to progressive and
          liberal<br>
          members of the group to become member of this Movement as well.<br>
          Being the Convener and Founder of this Movement, I would like leave my<br>
          little introduction.</p>
          <p><br>
          My name is <b>Tahir Aslam Gora</b>. I live in Ontario, Canada. I am
          Writer of<br>
          couple of Books. I have solution to get rid of International terror of
          Islamic Militants.<br>
          Therefore, I have initiated a <font color="#008000"><b>Movement for
          Liberation and Freedom of Islam<br>
          and Muslim World</b></font>. I feel the present model of Islam is not
          compatible with<br>
          the civilized attitudes of mankind. That's why I have proposed
          reformation<br>
          of Islam. <font color="#FF0000"><b>As I have announced the
          proclamation of New Islam, Muslims in<br>
          Toronto stopped my weekly Newspaper and they threatened to kill me for<br>
          various times.</b></font> At the moment, Muslim fanatics are trying
          their best to<br>
          suppress my voice. I need your support for this Great Movement. In
          this<br>
          situation of war against terrorism my message is a need of time. My
          message<br>
          may become a relief to the moderate Muslims. My message may become a<br>
          solution against Islamic terrorism.</p>
          <p>In short there is dire need in Islamic Countries for an
          intellectual<br>
          movement that can free them from centuries old religious bindings like
          other<br>
          nations who have changed the unnatural behaviors of their religions
          and<br>
          established a platform for the combined global society.</p>
          <p><br>
          I am providing you few Internet links for my introduction.<br>

          <br>
          HERE ARE OUTLINES OF THIS MOVEMENT</p>
          <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">NEW ISLAM MOVEMENT<br>
          <br>
          TAHIR ASLAM GORA</font></b><br>
          </p>
          <p><br>
          As a writer from a Muslim background and as a writer who often deals
          with<br>
          issues relating to Islam, it is of serious concern to me that there is
          a<br>
          disconnect between Islam on the one hand and the evolving realities of
          the<br>
          universe and the modern world. I therefore wish to suggest that
          Muslims<br>
          need to rethink their religion and their worldview. In making this<br>
          suggestion, I fully understand that we, the Muslims, cannot adopt any<br>
          religious identity other than Islam. We can, however, reform Islam in
          order<br>
          to bring it into harmony with the modern world. I suggest the
          following<br>
          outline for the 'New Islam'.<br>
          <br>
          1. The adoption of democratic values in every walk of life.<br>
          2. Recognition of the right of every person to complete freedom of<br>
          expression.<br>
          3. Recognition and application of internationally recognized human<br>
          rights.<br>
          4. An end to the institutions of Polygamy and Jihad.<br>
          5. A recognition of the equality of women in every walk of life.<br>
          6. An end to the superiority complex that exists among Muslims with<br>
          respect to the other nations of the world.<br>
          7. The creation of a practical environment of love towards all human<br>
          beings.<br>
          8. A recognition of the right to participate in all kinds of arts,<br>
          including dance, music &amp; paintings without any fear of censure.<br>
          9. The formulation of modern and liberal societies in Muslim
          countries.<br>
          10. A recognition of the need for Muslim scholars and laypeople to<br>
          engage in a frank and honest reassessment of historical Islamic<br>
          personalities instead of the emotional faith that has always
          characterized<br>
          Muslim attitudes towards such personages.<br>
          11. An end to the all-pervading fear of religious sin that
          characterizes<br>
          Islamic society.<br>
          12. A recognition that prayer and worship are symbolic, spiritual, and<br>
          above all, personal matters.<br>
          13. An end to taboos relating to food and drink, including alcoholic<br>
          drinks and 'halal' meat.<br>
          14. A recognition that the Quran is a symbolic, religious, and to some<br>
          extent, a<br>
          Spiritual book, which is not applicable to all walks of life.<br>
          15. A recognition that the ultimate object of The New Islam is peace
          for<br>
          all Human beings.<br>
          16. A recognition that understanding the realities of the universe<br>
          should be the basic pillar of the New Islam.<br>
          17. An appreciation of the world as a single, global society.<br>
          18. A recognition of the notion of God as a universal rather than a<br>
          religious entity.<br>
          19. A replacement of the term 'prophets' with the terms 'Intellectuals<br>
          and Leaders'.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to these basic points, new points and details will
          continue to<br>
          be added as required. In an ever-changing universe, the constant
          evolution<br>
          of an intellectual system is only rational.<br>
          <br>
          Following are brief explanations of the aforementioned basic
          principles.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. THE ADOPTION OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES:</b> It is very important to<br>
          understand the<br>
          Real form of democratic values. Most Muslims reject democracy as an<br>
          invention of the West, whereas democracy is the common heritage of all
          human<br>
          beings. Most Muslim nations believe democracy consists of elections or
          a<br>
          particular system of government. In fact, democracy, in addition to<br>
          elections &amp; system of government, involves recognition of the
          principle<br>
          'Live and Let Live'. It is this kind of tolerant and flexible behavior
          that<br>
          allows people to live together and respect all human beings in spite
          of<br>
          differences of religion, colour and race.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. COMPLETE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION:</b> Freedom of expression has
          always<br>
          been non-existent in the Islamic world. This is due to Muslims' need
          to<br>
          impose the Quran and Hadith on every walk of life, whereas most daily<br>
          affairs have no concern with religious scriptures. Although<br>
          Religious books do have some influence in every religion; this
          influence is<br>
          usually limited to the clergy in Christianity and has no concern with
          state<br>
          law. No one is allowed to express his/ her ideas in a Muslim society
          due to<br>
          the prevailing religious rigidity. Writers and journalists are<br>
          Sometimes ordered beheaded and writers do not have permission to
          express<br>
          their ideas about certain ' special topics. Prohibition to study the
          books<br>
          of famous and important writers such as Salman Rushdie is a typical
          example<br>
          in this regard. A lack of dialogue is the major problem in Muslim
          societies.<br>
          Creative ideas are strictly prohibited in our societies. We have now
          reached<br>
          the point that all the hard work of a writer is wasted due to his/ her
          own<br>
          'self sensorship'. Most of our writers have become so impulsive in
          religious<br>
          faith that they are ready to hang anyone arguing in favour of freedom
          of<br>
          expression. It is a fact that nations adopting the way of drubbing
          instead<br>
          of dialogue can never enjoy the magnificence of liberty.<br>
          Muslim societies cannot find the track of reality and truth without
          the<br>
          adoption of real freedom of expression.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. IMPLIMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS:</b> International
          Human<br>
          Rights are also rejected as they are considered an invention of the
          West,<br>
          whereas millions of Muslims are living in the West in a better way
          than<br>
          their own Islamic societies due to these very human rights. This is
          possible<br>
          only due to these human rights that Muslims are living according to
          their<br>
          religion in the Christian societies. The outline of human rights is
          actually<br>
          a great gift for mankind. We should try to make it better instead of<br>
          rejecting it.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>4. END TO POLYGAMY AND HOLY WAR (JIHAD):</b> Polygamy can never be
          an<br>
          appreciable practice. It is normally argued by Muslims that the
          prophet<br>
          allowed it for<br>
          the betterment of the widows and the destitute women's marital life,
          whereas<br>
          most of the Prophet's marriages were not with such women. Here we can
          only<br>
          say in soft words that it happened whatever it was. This inhuman
          practice<br>
          should now be abandoned. The 'jihad', the second name for the
          dominance of<br>
          Islam should also be banned.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. EQUALITY OF MEN &amp; WOMEN:</b> I have repeatedly written that
          Muslim<br>
          societies provide the status of a mother, sister, daughter and wife to
          a<br>
          woman but are not ready to accept her status as a human being and as a<br>
          woman. The Modern world is appreciable in this regard that it provides<br>
          equal rights to all human beings without any distinction of sex.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. ENDING THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX AMONG MUSLIMS AGAINST OTHER
          NATIONS:</b><br>
          It is a fact that most of us do not know about the civilized way of
          living<br>
          but even then we become guilty of human disgrace. We, the Muslims,
          consider<br>
          other nations inferior because we think ourselves to be on the right
          path<br>
          and uniquely entitled to heaven. The other nations are therefore
          considered<br>
          to destine for hell. Leaving such ideas behind we can become able to<br>
          understand the realities of life and the universe. Not only the
          Western<br>
          world but also<br>
          the Chinese, Japanese, other nations of the Far East and liberal
          nations of<br>
          East India including Hindus are on the way of understanding the
          beauties of<br>
          the life, adopting liberal ways.<br>
          One of the major reasons in consideration of the superiority of Islam
          is the<br>
          thinking that it is the only religion from God and so we consider
          ourselves<br>
          as a 'Chosen Nation' among all the human beings. Although most of the<br>
          religions have the same ownership claim about God, the rigidity in
          this<br>
          respect has already decreased among them, whereas Muslims are not
          ready to<br>
          accept the reality that God is not a religious embodiment. God is
          actually<br>
          the name of the Universe of which we are one part.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7. ESTABLISHING A PRACTICAL ENVIRONMENT OF LOVE TO ALL HUMAN
          BEINGS:</b><br>
          Muslims will have to give a message of love to all the human beings.
          It<br>
          should be<br>
          Exhibited practically.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. PARTICIPATING IN ALL TYPES OF ARTS LIKE DANCE, MUSIC, AND
          PAINTINGS</b><br>
          ETC.: The importance of art in Muslim society was felt during<br>
          'Khalafat-e-Osmania' at the state level. But afterwards, Muslim states<br>
          started to become a factor in the abolition of the arts. Now during
          the 21st<br>
          century most Muslim societies consider the arts as an uncivilized
          activity<br>
          and a<br>
          Serious crime according to the religion. Such an attitude is now to be<br>
          ceased to enjoy the beauties of life. Life should be decorated and
          happy<br>
          occasions should be celebrated accordingly. Muslim societies should
          adopt an<br>
          attitude to participate in all sort of art including dance, music and<br>
          Painting etc without any feeling of religious sin. Education of these
          arts<br>
          should be arranged &amp; popularized by establishing Art Academies and
          the best<br>
          quality clubs.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>9. FORMULATION OF MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETIES IN THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES:</b><br>
          Muslim societies should not become a hurdle in creating a promiscuous<br>
          society in their countries according to the 'New Islam'. Modern
          liberal<br>
          societies should be established in all Muslim countries. Gays and
          Lesbians<br>
          should be provided the rights according to the International status.<br>
          <br>
          <b>10. FRIENDLY, FRANK AND INFORMAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH HISTORICAL
          ISLAMIC PERSONALITIES:</b> A friendly and frank attitude should be
          adopted instead of<br>
          Expressing any emotional relational relationship with historical
          Islamic<br>
          personalities. We go up to worship the Prophets, the Poise Caliphs,
          Imams,<br>
          Sufis and Mullahs etc. We should adopt a friendlier attitude and
          informal<br>
          relationship with them. We should get rid of the ugly habit about<br>
          concealment of facts in the life of our religious personalities. For<br>
          instance while trying to learn something about the life of the prophet
          of<br>
          Islam, it should be kept in mind that being a great leader of his era,
          he<br>
          was a human being like us. His historical greatness can also be
          explained<br>
          In the fact that he formulated the best human principals of his time.
          But<br>
          being a human being he had human instincts too. His love for women for<br>
          instance was due to the human instinct. He used to practice politics<br>
          throughout his life because a society could not be established without<br>
          political strategies. We do have the same emotions about the 'Poise<br>
          Caliphs'. They also continue the<br>
          Political struggle and as a matter of fact, some of them were involved
          in<br>
          the conspiracy of killing the other. There is no harm to accept these<br>
          realities. They were a part of the history and same is the today's
          man. The<br>
          Imams tried to understand the facts about religion using their wisdom
          in the<br>
          same way. They used all the available sources of knowledge to their
          level<br>
          best. A true saint is not actually restricted to any religion but
          he/she<br>
          represents humanity. All the Sufis of the Muslim world (previous &amp;
          coming)<br>
          will no doubt be a part of the same category. Prophets used to be the<br>
          Leaders of their nations. The present intellectuals, writers,
          scientists,<br>
          thinkers, philosophers, sincere social workers and the saints,
          providing<br>
          guidance to the nations are not less than the prophets.<br>
          <br>
          <b>11. ENDING FEELINGS OF RELIGIOUS SIN:</b> It is necessary end
          feelings of<br>
          religious sin according to the 'New Islam' to save the human energies
          from<br>
          rusting with this feeling. This is also important to make one's mind
          free<br>
          and liberal. A sense of responsibility is rather a good feeling than
          sense<br>
          of sin. The sense of sin about dance, singing and drinking etc. is too
          great<br>
          in Islam, and causes Muslims to become hypocrite. Such feelings do not
          have<br>
          any concern with today's life and universe. Muslims have now come to
          the<br>
          point that a boy and a girl cannot<br>
          have a 'date' without this sense of sin.<br>
          <br>
          <b>12. CONSIDERATION OF PRAYERS AS SYMBOLIC, RITUAL AND PERSONAL
          MATTERS:</b><br>
          There is no harm in several traditional prayers and worship, but these<br>
          should not<br>
          be considered as the be-all and end-all of life. It is sufficient to<br>
          consider these practices to be a matter of personal consolation. Some
          of<br>
          these practices like the sacrifice of the animals should be
          immediately<br>
          stopped.<br>
          <br>
          <b>13. AN END TO TABOOS ON ALCOHOL AND HALAL MEAT:</b> The prohibition
          of<br>
          alcohol and pork is meaningless today. The alcohol drinking nations
          have<br>
          proved themselves to be better in moral and human values. The use of
          alcohol<br>
          will just be a personal matter in the 'New Islam', having no concern
          with<br>
          the principles of the religion. The theory of 'Halal Meat' is a
          ridiculous<br>
          thing today.<br>
          <br>
          <b>14. CONSIDERING QURAN AS A SYMBO:IC, RELIGIOUS, AND SPIRITUAL BOOK:</b><br>
          Quran should be considered as a symbolic, religious and to some extent
          a<br>
          spiritual book The reality of the spirituality become evident by
          freely<br>
          understanding the secrets and symbols of the universe. The Quran
          should not<br>
          be considered as a book, which can be implemented in every walk of
          life. It<br>
          is evident that no economic and social system could be developed in
          the<br>
          light of the Quran or any other religious book. This is the reason
          that<br>
          Canada and several European<br>
          Countries have developed such a human system which could never been<br>
          developed in any Islamic country. We, the Muslim societies should have
          come<br>
          to this level but no Muslim country is presently not even at 10%
          humanistic<br>
          as compared to these societies.<br>
          <br>
          <b>15. ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE THE 'NEW ISLAM': </b>The ultimate objective
          of the<br>
          'New<br>
          Islam' should only be the peace of human beings.<br>
          <br>
          <b>16. BASIC PILLAR OF THE 'NEW ISLAM': </b>No doubt, the basic pillar
          of the<br>
          'New<br>
          Islam' should be considered to understand the secrets and symbols of
          the<br>
          universe.<br>
          <br>
          <b>17. CONCEPT OF SHARING THE WORLD:</b> The world is a shared global
          society<br>
          today. It<br>
          cannot be made a shared living place for all the human beings without
          any<br>
          intellectual struggle as all the demonstrated human rights declared up
          till<br>
          now are the result of the continuation of the intellectual struggle.
          Western<br>
          intellectuals brought the West out of the religious rigidity during
          the 20th<br>
          century and separated the religion from the daily human life. Moreover
          they<br>
          tried to make the human mind so vast that religion cannot make them
          slaves.<br>
          It also helped the human beings to be restricted from blind faith in<br>
          religion and understanding the realities of the universe. It is now
          duty of<br>
          the intellectuals of the Islamic World to bring the Muslims out of the<br>
          emotional and drubbing policies to share the beauties of the universe
          being<br>
          shoulder to shoulder to all the nations of the world.<br>
          <br>
          <b>18. CONCEPT OF THE 'UNIVERSAL GOD' INSTEAD OF THE 'RELIGIOUS GOD:</b><br>
          According to the 'New Islam' God is a universal phenomenon being
          itself a<br>
          part of humanity, all the religions and systems. It is not a specific<br>
          conception but it is a universal unit to which everything in the
          universe is<br>
          belonged.<br>
          <br>
          <b>19. USE OF THE TERM 'INTELLECTUALS' INSTEAD OF THE 'PROPHETS'</b>:
          The terms<br>
          'intellectual and leaders' will be used instead of the old term of the<br>
          'prophet' in the<br>
          'New Islam'. The 'New Islam' will grow in an extremely democratic way.
          There<br>
          is no need of any type of Prophets, Gurus, or Leaders, but the 'New
          Islam'<br>
          will be put forward as an intellectual movement.<br>
          <br>
          I do understand that ladies and gents addicted to Islamic ethics will
          bring<br>
          arguments of 'Aya &amp; Hadith' and an abundance of questions in
          burdensome<br>
          religious language but it is a fact that these terminologies have no
          weight<br>
          today. The references from 'Imams' also have no justification at
          present.<br>
          The realities of life and the universe are simple and evident,
          sufficient to<br>
          understand the life, life after life, the universe &amp; the universe
          after<br>
          universe with vast &amp; free mind. The 'New Islam' is necessary for
          the<br>
          struggle of bringing the life of the miserable nations, bound by
          religious<br>
          rigidity, on the way of exhilaration.<br>
