                &quot;France regrets this action undertaken without the approval
                of the United Nations,&quot; French President Jacques Chirac
                said in a televised address.
                <p>&quot;It hopes that operations will be as rapid and as
                victim-free as possible and does not lead to a humanitarian
                catastrophe,&quot; he said.</p>
                <p>France spearheaded opposition to the US and British push for
                war, vowing to veto a UN resolution that would have paved the
                way for military action and thus forcing the two to go it
                virtually alone against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
                <p>Russia and Germany, firmly aligned with Paris in the anti-war
                camp, denounced the outbreak of war.</p>
                <p>In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin described the US-led
                offensive as a &quot;serious political mistake&quot; and called
                for an immediate halt to hostilities.</p>
                <p>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called war a &quot;defeat for
                politics&quot; and said &quot;a bad decision was taken,&quot;
                but in cautious comments he and top German ministers focused on
                post-war reconstruction of Iraq rather than heaping blame on
                Washington.</p>
                <p>&quot;This is bitter news,&quot; Foreign Minister Joschka
                Fischer said. &quot;We hope the hostilities will be completed as
                quickly as possible and that the civilian population will be
                protected.&quot;</p>
                <p>China, a UN Security Council permanent member also opposed to
                war, appealed to the &quot;relevant countries to stop the use of
                military force.&quot;</p>
                <p>India, another nuclear power, joined Beijing in calling the
                US-led attack a violation of the UN Charter.</p>
                <p>The Vatican also &quot;deplored&quot; Washington's move, with
                Cardinal Roberto Tucci, a close confidant of Pope John Paul II,
                saying the war went beyond &quot;all legality and all
                international legitimacy&quot;.</p>
                <p>Pope John Paul II, for months a key moral voice opposing war,
                &quot;deplores that negotiations under international law to find
                a peaceful solution to the Iraqi drama were interrupted,&quot;
                his spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.</p>
                <p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the United States and
                Britain to do everything possible to protect civilians from
                undue harm and suffering during their campaign to unseat Saddam.</p>
                <p>&quot;I hope that all parties will scrupulously observe the
                requirements of international humanitarian law, and will do
                everything in their power to shield the civilian population from
                the grim consequences of war,&quot; he said.</p>
                <p>Mexico, a Security Council member heavily sollicited for
                support during the UN diplomatic drive, came down against its
                northern neighbor, with President Vicente Fox stating: &quot;We
                are against the war.&quot;</p>
                <p>Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada restricted his
                reaction to the hope that the conflict &quot;will be brief, with
                a minimum number of victims on both sides&quot;. On Monday he
                had called the war &quot;unjustified&quot;.</p>
                <p>In the Middle East, the Palestinian Authority strongly
                condemned the military campaign by US President George W. Bush,
                warning Israel not to use the conflict as a pretext for stepping
                up incursions in the Palestinian territories.</p>
                <p>Arab states Jordan and Saudi Arabia said they were worried
                about the conflict in the region, while others denounced
                Washington as tens of thousands of their citizens rallied in the
                streets and called for a holy war against the United States.</p>
                <p>In Beirut, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud warned: &quot;We
                see this aggression today plunging the world into a tunnel where
                one cannot see the end.&quot;</p>
                <p>In Turkey, the parliament approved the right of US warplanes
                to use Turkish airspace although not its bases for raids against
                Iraq, but President Ahmet Necdet Sezer voiced opposition to the
                US-led war shared by the vast majority of Turks.</p>
                <p>&quot;I do not find the unilateral US action right&quot;, he
                said.</p>
                <p>But not all reaction to the start of US-led military action
                against Baghdad was negative.</p>
                <p>Australia reaffirmed its commitment to the campaign with an
                announcement from Prime Minister John Howard that Australian
                special forces had begun combat duties alongside US and British
                forces.</p>
                <p>Japan and South Korea also reiterated their support for the
                United States.</p>
                <p>&quot;I understand the start of the use of force by America
                and support it,&quot; Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
                said in Tokyo, while South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun said he
                would send non-combat troops to the region.</p>
                <p>Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq found strong backing
                among several eastern European states, which have been torn
                between their desire to join with EU neighbors to the west, and
                to back the US, thereby scoring points with the most influential
                member of the NATO.</p>
                <p>NATO-ally Hungary's Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy said the
                conflict with Iraq was &quot;unavoidable&quot;, while Bulgaria,
                Romania, Lativa and Estonia renewed their support.</p>
                <p>The Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have sent
                anti-chemical specialists to the Gulf, said however they could
                not join military operations because they lacked a UN mandate.</p>
                <p>In Britain -- the closest US ally -- Foreign Secretary Jack
                Straw described the onset of war as the last chapter of Saddam's
                iron-fisted rule, and the beginning of Iraq's liberation.</p>
                <p>&quot;We are with you. We support you,&quot; Straw told a
                press conference, in remarks directed at the Iraqi people.
                &quot;We want to see your suffering come to an end.&quot;</p>
                <p>Spain, a strong voice in the pro-war coalition, said
                international law would be strengthened by Saddam's ouster.
                &quot;The government of this nation supports the
                re-establishment of international law so that conditions for
                peace and security prevail,&quot; Prime Minister Jose Maria
                Aznar said.</p>
                <p>And in Italy, where hundreds of thousands of anti-war
                protesters greeted the first day of war, Foreign Minister Franco
                Frattini called the disarmament of Iraq &quot;a tragic
                necessity&quot; for the international community.</p>

        &quot;This is no ordinary day,&quot; said Jason Mark, a protester in San
        Francisco. &quot;America is different today.
        <p>&quot;We've just launched an unprovoked, unjust war.&quot;</p>
        <p>Anti-war demonstrators in New York completely blocked New York's
        Broadway for two blocks below 42nd Street, while hundreds of protesters
        gathered in Washington and at university campuses around the country.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of students at Harvard University walked out of classes at
        noon, and at least 1,500 people took part in a rally.</p>
        <p>Some of the biggest outbursts of opposition to the war have been in
        Europe.</p>
        <p>In Brussels, police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse
        hundreds of protesters who were throwing stones outside the US embassy.</p>
        <p>Organisers said 3,000 people joined the protest, though police put
        the figure at 1,500.</p>
        <p><b>Arab nations angry</b></p>
        <p>Egyptian riot police used water canon and batons to beat back crowds
        throwing rocks and trying to advance on the US embassy in Cairo.</p>
        <p>&quot;We just wanted to tell the Americans they are no longer welcome
        here,&quot; said student leader Fadlallah Abu Wafia.</p>

        Protesters unfurled banners reading &quot;Shame on USA&quot; and
        &quot;Vive la France, Arab governments go to hell&quot;.
        <p>Much of the anger was directed against Arab leaders for not opposing
        the US action.</p>
        <p>In the Syrian capital, Damascus, demonstrators waved Iraqi flags and
        denounced US President George W Bush as a war criminal.</p>
        <p>Crowds tried to advance on the US embassy before being forced back.</p>
        <p>They also marched on the Egyptian embassy, and the embassy of Qatar -
        the host of the US Central Command for the duration of the war.</p>
