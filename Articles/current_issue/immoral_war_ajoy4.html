          convincingly proved that during Iraq-Iran war perhaps in the beginning
          of 1984, and certainly by 1986 Saddam Hussein had used chemical
          weapons fairly in large scale in the battlefield against Iranian
          troops or even against Iranian people. The UN appointed investigation
          team in its report categorically said that they did find sufficient
          evidence of use of chemical warfare agents in the Iraq-Iran war. At
          least on three occasions i.e. in 1984, 1986 and 1987, the report said,
          the Iraqi government had used <span style="COLOR: red">mustard gas and

          the inhabitants of the bombarded villages, later treated in a Tehran
          Hospital, Iraqi warplanes dropped no less than 18 chemical bombs at
          the villages Sheikh Dassan, Kani Bard, Pasian and Tuteman severely
          wounding hundreds of people. It is now known that chemical bombardment
          was carried out at least twice in twenty four villages within 48
          hours. In those bombardments more than 130 innocent villagers were
          martyred and more than five hundred were wounded.</p>

          large-scale chemical weapons against these people, (b) use of
          conventional terrorism, torture and repression leading to large-scale
          killings, (c) pushing out the population eastward to Iran and westward

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Let me very briefly
          introduce the Kurdish people to our general readers for the sake of
          completeness of the article. Kurds form 19 % of Iraqi population i.e.
          3.1 million in absolute term, according to 1987 census. They are the
          largest non-Arab ethnic minorities racially belonging to Iranian
          branch of great Indo-Iranian Aryan stock as against Semitic stock of
          the majority Iraqis. In that sense Kurds are first cousins of
          Iranians, although religiously they are Sunnis and should have been
          nearer to Sunni Iraqis. If we look at the map of the northern region
          of Iraq its northern periphery looks like an arc of a big circle. This
          arc forms the boundary of northern Iraq with Eastern Turkey and
          touches the northwestern border of Syria and on the northwest it forms
          a line of demarcation with Iran into the region of the Zagros
          Mountains in Iran.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In northern region of
          Iraq the Kurds are the overwhelming majority in As Sulaymaniyah, Irbil,
          and Dahuk provinces with considerable majority in the region of Kirkuk
          and Masul, two very rich oil producing regions. The population, though
          with lesser degree of concentration, extends up to as far south as
          Khanaqin. Iraqi Kurds although split into several tribal groups are
          part of a larger Kurdish people scattered over in a geographically
          contagious vast areas on both sides of the arc we talked about ? in
          eastern Turkey, northwestern part of Syria, and north east of Zagros
          Mountains in Iran. The population also extends into through northern
          Iran into erstwhile Soviet Azerbaijan. It has been estimated that the
          total population of Kurdish nationalities far exceed 16 million
          (1987). Kurds in Iraq are however very much politically active and by
          far advanced in every respect compared to Kurds living in other
          countries, although the largest number lives in Turkey, numbering
          between 3-10 millions.</p>

          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Traditionally Kurdish
          society has been organized on tribal basis. They used to live in
          highlands and mountain valleys. Although with the introduction of
          education and modernism the old tribal cohesion has been broken down,
          but even today, the tribes like the Hekki, the Sorchi, and Zibari
          maintain a powerful cohesion. This cohesive attachment also reflect in
          their political organizations. Once mainly nomadic or semi nomadic,
          Kurdish society was characterized by a combination of urban centres,
          villages, and pastoral since the Ottoman period. However records show
          that from the eighteenth century onward Kurds, at least those living
          in northern Iraq, were mainly peasants engaged in agriculture and
          arboriculture. By the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, more than 20% Kurds
          lived in historic Kurdistan such as Kirkuk, As Sulamaniyah, and Irbil.
          The migration to the cities, particularly the young educated
          intelligentsia, helped forming Kurdish nationalism. So northern Iraq
          became the cradle of modern and new concept of Kurdish nationalism.
          During sixties of twentieth century, the urbanization of Kurdish areas
          rapidly grew. There were large scale migration of Kurdish villagers
          from their traditional tribal abodes to the cities- this migration
          apart from the general trend of urban migration, a worldwide
          phenomenon of underdeveloped areas throughout the world in those time,
          was also prompted by increasing arm-conflicts between the Kurdish
          nationalists and the Baghdad authority, destruction of villages and
          land by widespread bombing coupled with of course natural disasters
          like severe droughts in the 1958-61 period. The severe fighting not
          only brought destruction of rural population and Kurdish natural
          resources, it hindered the progress of education, health, and other
          developments.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As more and
          modernization were taking place in the area of Kurdistan political
          consciousness among the Kurdish people deepening. They organized
          themselves in political lines in parallel to tribal units. The Kurdish
          Democratic Party (KDP), perhaps the largest political party of the
          Kurds, is largely composed of the Kurds of the most north and extreme
          northeastern regions of Iraq; The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)
          is primarily an organization of the Kurds inhabiting around Kirkuk and
          south to Khanaqin. These Kurdish elements however, unlike other Kurds,
          are followers of Shia variety of Islam like Iranians and popularly
          known as <i>Faili Kurds</i>; On the other hand the Iraqi Communist
          Party (CPI) had significant number of Kurdish population living in far
          northwestern region of Iraq around Sinjar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">If we browse through
          the history of these culturally enriched fine people, traditionally
          being dominated, oppressed and looked down by the Turk Ottoman
          imperialists, Mesopotamian Arabs and even by the Russians we see that
          in modern times too they have been locked in an unremittingly violent
          struggle with the Central authority in Baghdad since the founding of
          the Iraqi republic in 1958. In 1970 it appeared that under the
          leadership of Mullah Mustafa Barzani, also an important leader of KDP,
          the Kurds might actually carve out an independent Kurdish area in
          northern Iraq. But the out break of Iraq-Iran conflict during
          seventies made the things worse for the cause of Kurdish independence
          as the Shah of Iran had to withdraw his support from the fighting
          Kurds in Iraq because of the Algiers Accord signed between Tehran and
          Baghdad (1975). This new political development caused a breakaway in
          the KDP, then led by Masud Bazrani, son of Mulla Mustafa Bazrani. The
          KDP leadership then had chosen a path of <i>go slow </i>and came to
          some understanding with the Baghdad?s Arab authority. This annoyed a
          section of KDP and a breakaway faction that left the KDP in opposition
          to the accord formed a new political party the Patriotic Union of
          Kurdistan (PUK) under Jalal Talbani. The PUK continued its armed
          struggle in guerrilla fashion against the Iraq?s central authority
          from 1975 to 1080, when yet another full scale war between Iraq and
          Iran broke out as the invading Army of Saddam?s Iraq entered the
          sensitive regions on both sides of Shatt al Arab in Iran. Needless to
          say the war of eighties opened up a good opportunity to the PUK and
          other Kurdish groups fighting for independent Kurdistan to intensify
          their fight against the Central government.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 1983, the KDP
          spearheaded an Iranian thrust into northern Iraq and later its cadres
          fanned out along the areas bordering Turkey where they established a
          string of bases. On the other hand the PUK fighters made their
          presence felt in the farther down to south around Kirkuk and As
          Sulamaniyah, despite ruthless attempts by the Baghdad authority to
          dislodge and disperse them. In brief we may say before the ceasefire
          of Iraq-Iran war (1980-88) most of the northern areas of Iraq, outside
          the major cities, were under the control of variant Kurdish
          guerrillas. It must also be admitted for the sake of truth softer
          elements of Kurdish population and many powerful tribes lent support
          to the central government throughout the war with the hope that after
          the war a true autonomous Kurdistan within Iraq would be established.
          It was also apprehended that if the Baath government led by Saddam
          survived it was almost certain to punish those Kurds who collaborated
          with the Iranians. And history saw how cruel and severity could be the
          nature of punishment. A worst crime of genocide was committed by the
          Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his ruthless army.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">By any definition of
          nationalism Kurds in the northern Iraq and in contagious areas of
          Turkey, Syria, Iran and Azerbaijan constitute a nation. They occupy a
          contagious geographical area, they have rich tradition, history,
          culture and a developed language. These elements bind the Kurdish
          people as a nation. If we Bengalis can form ourselves a nation why not
          the Kurds? The historic enmity between the Kurds and the central Arab
          government of Iraq (and other neighboring countries? governments too)
          has contributed to the tenacious survival of Kurdish culture. The
          Kurds? most distinguishing characteristics and the one that binds them
          to one another is their language (as for us Bengali language). There
          are although several dialects, the attempts have been made
          successfully to develop a standard written form. The Kurdish language
          is not just a dialect of Persian (Farsi), as many Iranian Pundits
          still maintain. It is certainly not a variant of either Semitic or
          Turkic tongues. It is a distinct and separate language branching out
          from Indo-European family, though it might show some similarity with
          Persian as both sprang from the same stock ( Uriya or Asamese show
          with our Bengali lamguage).</p>

          conversant in Arabic language and the holy Koran explained to me that
          nearest English equivalent of the Arabic ward <i>Anfal</i> is
          ?Spoils?- also the name of the 8<sup>th</sup> <i>sura</i> of the holy
          book. My friends further said that Anfal is the plural of the ward <i>nafal
          </i>meaning favour, charity (or donation) and a special meaning
          attached to it is <i>ganimat</i>, war booty i.e. the wealth including
          salves and women, fall at the hand of the victorious Muslim-army in a
          war or jihad. Girish Chandra Sen, the first translator of Koran

          holds of Kurdish guerilla forces constantly fighting against the
          central authority in Baghdad. Halabja is a city of green and fertile

          is not less tragic than Karbala. Date line was18<sup>th</sup> March,
          1988, the day was Friday, Islamic holy day. The brutal massacre of the
          oppressed and innocent people of the city began before the sunrise.
          The inhabitants witnessed on the day that their city was bombarded
          twenty time or more by Iraqi air force planes with chemical and
          cluster bombs. In the afternoon the magnitude and scale of massacre
          unfolded. Corpses piled up over one another in the streets and alleys
          of the town. Children playing in front of their houses were simply
          martyred instantly from cyanide gas coming out of chemical bombs. Some
          children trying to reach their homes fell down at the threshold of the
          door of their houses and never rose again. A mother, who embraced her
          one-year-old baby, fell down two steps from her house and was
          martyred. Within a radius of 150 meter around the main street of the
          city at least fifty women and children met death as a result of
          bombing of chemical warfare. A father was sitting over the bodies of
          wife and ten of his children in his alley and was wailing that would
          touch even any cruel human being but not the Iraqi killers, as they
          were not human beings. Indeed they were machines of Saddam Hussein. In
          a Simorgh Van, the corpses of 20 women and children who had been
          prepared to leave the town but failed to do so as chemical bombs
          instantly killed them.</p>

          houses were left open and inside of each house, there were martyred
          and wounded people. In Halabja alone more than <i><span style="COLOR: #3366ff">five
          thousand people were martyred</span></i> and over <i>seven thousand
          more people were wounded</i>. Women and children were the immediate
          targets; out of the causalities seventy five percent constitute women
          and children. The other affected areas were Khormal, Dojaileh and
          their surroundings, which were frequently bombarded with chemical
          warfare, but the centre of catastrophe was Halabja. Saddam?s crime
          against humanity has no parallel in recent history if we keep aside
          the tragedy of Jewish people in Germany of Hitler. His crime committed

          Alastair, Senior lecturer of Pathology at Leeds University, England,
          speaking on BBC Television and BBC Radio World service on 22<sup>nd</sup>
          and 23<sup>rd</sup> March, 1988 had this to say : ?.. The Kurds have
          claimed for a number of months, perhaps over a year, that Iraq has
          been using chemical agents against them. But this latest occasion
          seems to be the first really documented case that we have where
          chemical agents have been used. ... Iraq has used chemical agents
          against Iran on a very large scale for three years now. And although
          the west and other countries have been condemnatory about that use,
          the country (Iraq) still felt secure enough to use chemical agents.
          They have used them because these agents are very effective against
          and opposition that has no protection and until such time as there is
          perhaps an end to war, or sufficient sanctions against Iraq to
          persuade it not to use chemical agents. I am afraid they will continue
          to use them or so it seems. </font>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span style="COLOR: windowtext"><o:p>

          is another remote village of 30 houses, a mosque, and school, in

          against the Kurds. The villagers on all a sudden in the morning of 25<sup>th</sup>
          August, 1988 found themselves pounded with chemical bombings. The
          Iraqi warplanes dropped at least three clusters each with four bombs
          mixed with chemical agents. The eyewitnesses remember seeing a plume
          of black, and then yellowish smoke followed by a not-unpleasant odor
          similar to fertilizer mixed with a smell of rotten garlic. Immediately
          afterwards as soon as the escaping gases started diffusing in the air,
          the villagers felt breathing trouble, their eyes watered, skin
          blistered, and many vomited, and some died also. All these symptoms,
          the physicians said later, were consistent with a poison gas attack.

          only a temporal leader, but a spiritual too. Imamate is a hereditary
          institution that nominates its successor in consultation with other
          twelve leading spiritual leaders (imams) each enjoying equal powers.
          The imamate must be capable of providing temporal leadership as well
          as spiritual guidance- called <i>walayet</i> in Shiah vocabulary, the
          ability to interpret the inner mysteries of the Koran and the <i>sharia</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A Shiah Muslim
          believes that Muhammad, founder of the last but greatest religion,
          Islam designated Hazrat Ali, his son in law and fourth Caliph, to be
          his successor as Imam, exercising both spiritual and temporal
          leadership. Ali was a great personality in the history of Islam and
          Arab, a man of learning, a heroic soldier of Islam, a life long close
          associate &amp; co-fighter of Prophet Muhammad in all wars except one
          that Prophet fought against the infidels. Needless to say with his
          rare qualities Ali earned deep love and affection from the Prophet who
          chose him as his son in law to his beloved daughter, Fatema. Although
          Sunnis accepted the legitimacy of Alis assumption to fourth
          Caliphate, they reject the Shias contention that the Prophet
          nominated Ali as his successor as Imam of the Islamic world. On the
          other hand Shia-belief maintains that the imamate began with Ali who
          had been wrongly and willfully bypassed and denied the Caliphate after
          the demise of Prophet. Shias believe that the imamate beginning with
          Ali<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>continued
          through his two sons Hasan and Hussein, the hero of the Karbala
          tragedy uninterrupted until the twelfth Imam (874 AD), a boy of only
          five years only, who had disappeared from earth sometime in 939 AD.
          Shias still believe that the Imams disappearance was not associated
          with death, as the Sunnis claimed; rather the great occultation is a
          divine phenomenon, a wish of the God almighty. The phenomenon bears a
          close similarity with Jesus disappearance after crucifixion. The
          Sunnis contented that the so-called twelfth Imam never existed or that
          he died while still a child. This divine occultation would last until
          God commands the Imam to manifest himself as the Mahdi or Messiah
          before the final Day of Judgment, according to Shia faith. Among Shias,
          the term <i>imam</i> is kept reserved only for Ali and his eleven
          descendents.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Although a Shiah imam
          was supposed to give spiritual and temporal leadership, no Shiah Imam,
          except Ali ever ruled any Muslim State in the history of Islam. Their
          followers however believed that one day they would surely assume state
          power, the power that had been wrongly usurped. As this contention of
          the Shias were known to the Sunni Caliphs of Umayyad and Abbasid
          dynasties, the Shiah Imams were looked upon with suspicion and were
          persecuted during those periods. Therefore the imams tried to be as
          unobtrusive as possible and to live as far as was reasonable from the
          successive capitals of the Islamic empire. This historical tradition
          still continues even in modern Iraq. The Shias are or were never even
          nearer to state power even though they constitute more than sixty
          percent in Iraqi population. Only in 9<sup>th</sup> century during the
          Abbasid caliphate of Mamun (813-33), the 8<sup>th</sup> Shiah Imam,
          Reza enjoyed the confidence of Mamun and came very near to state
          power. The caliph invited him to his court at Marv, (in erstwhile
          Soviet union) from Medina. He nominated him as his successor to the
          caliphate. In the military campaign against his political rivalries to
          recapture Baghdad Mamun was joined by Imam Reza. But, Shias believed
          that he was poisoned to death as Imams popularity was on the
          increase overshadowing the Caliph. This act of suspected treachery on
          the part of Mamun tended to reinforce a feeling already prevalent
          among the Shias that the Sunni rulers were never trustworthy. This
          tradition of mutual distrust in the Shiah-Sunni relation still is
          prevalent.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Although Shiah school
          of theology dates back to Imamate of Ali in mid seventh century the
          doctrines Imamate was not fully elaborated until the 10<sup>th</sup>
          century. Other rituals were developed still later. The main
          distinguishing feature of Shiah variant of Islam is the continual
          exposition and reinterpretation of Islamic doctrines. Another
          important Shia faith, as I see, concerns of divine justice and the
          individuals responsibility for his acts, which are judged by a just
          God. This however contrasts with Sunni view that Gods creation of
          man allows minimal possibility for the exercise of free will. Another
          important Shia practice is <i>taqiyah</i>, dissimulation, which means
          hiding or disavowal of ones religion or its practices to escape the
          danger of death from those opposed to the faith. this is termed as
          cowardly and irreligious by the Sunnis. However origin of <i>Taqiya</i>
          lies in the historical persecution of Shiah Imams during the Umayyad
          and Abbasid caliphates. And in this historical perspective the Shia-Sunni
          relation of present day Iraq must be looked into.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As is Sunni school,
          the Shia school is also divided into several sects; most important one
          is known as <i>Twelver</i> or <i>Ithna-Ashari</i> sect, which
          predominates among world Shia community. They are considered as
          political quietists in contrast to another important sect known as <i>Zaydis</i>
          who are most political activists. The <i>Ismailis</i>, popularly known
          as Aga Khanis in the subcontinent, identified with esoteric and
          gnostic religious doctrines.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Within Twelver there
          exists two major divisions, one known as <i>Usuli</i> and the other <i>Akhbari</i>.
          The dominant <i>Usulis</i> are more liberal in its outlook and allows
          greater use of interpretation (<i>ijtihad</i>) in reaching legal
          decisions, and the school considers that one must obey a <i>mujtahid</i>
          (learned interpreter of the law) as well as an Imam. <i>Akhbaris</i>
          constitute a very small sub-sect and are found around Basra, the
          second city of modern Iraq, southern Iraq and Khorramahahr in Iran.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have traced out
          very briefly the development of Shia-Sunni Relation historical
          perspective since the Shia variant Islam came into existence with the
          assumption of the office of the Caliphate by Ali, the first Imamate of
          Shia Islam. Iraq is the birth place of Shiaism wherein located all
          most all holy shrines of Imams including the tomb of Hazrat Ali in
          Najaf and that of his son Imam Hussein, who became the greatest martyr
          of Islam during a battle with troops of Yazid, the second monarch of
          Ummayad dynasty in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>Karbala, tombs of seventh and ninth Imams at Kazimayn, near
          Baghdad. A significant practice of Shia Islam is that of visiting
          these shrines both in Iraq and Iran.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The historical strained
          relation continued even in modern Iraq, a monarchic modern State was
          created from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in 1921 by the British.
          However, it must be said that the this rival strained relation is
          prevalent between the ruling minority Sunni class and the Shia Clergy
          on the one hand, and on the other hand, between the Sunni minority
          ruling elite and the educated and professional middle class of the
          Shias i.e. the Shia elite who aspire for power in a modern democratic
          set up of the state system. Dominating Sunni elite thinks that they
          are the traditional and natural rulers of Iraq. In contrast to this
          feeling of the Sunni elite, the Shia Clergy considers that they are
          the legal rulers of Iraq as they inherited the tradition of Shia
          imamate who had been deprived off the state power i.e. caliphate
          through the treachery of Sunni rulers.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It must be admitted, however,
          that the relation between common Shias and common Sunnis is excellent
          throughout history. There were not many riots and conflicts between
          the two dominant religious communities. They have learnt from history
          how to coexist and live peacefully in a multiracial and
          multi-religious Iraqi society.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">But there is no denying of the
          fact that there exists a sense of deprivation among general Shia
          members and a feeling that being a majority of the Iraqi population
          they have been long eclipsed by Iraqs more powerful Sunni Muslim
          minority. A similar feeling we, nationalist Bengalis in the then
          Pakistan had against the <u>Punjabi dominated minority civil-military
          elite of West Pakistan</u>. A dominant view, somewhat simplistic, of
          political analysts held that Iraq was and still is badly split along
          sectarian lines. The fact was that the Sunnis, although a minority,
          ran Iraq and subjected the Majority Shias to systematic
          discrimination. According to the prevailing belief, the Shias would
          drive the Sunnis from the power on the first opportunity. This notion
          has definitely some basis. For many years Arab Sunnis who tended to
          come from a restricted area around Baghdad, Mosul, and Ar Rutbah, the
          so-called Golden triangle, ruled Iraq by-and-large. On the surface it
          might appear true. Even as early as 1980s, not only was President
          Saddam, a Sunni, but he was the Vice President of the ruling Baath
          party (Arab Socialist Resurrection). One of the two deputy prime
          ministers and the defence minister were also Sunnis. In addition,
          Sunnis have usually held the top posts in the security services, and
          most of the armys corps commanders have been Sunnis. It is also
          true that the most depressed region of the country is the south, where
          the bulk of the Shias reside.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">But the real problem is not the
          conflict between Shia vs. Sunni in religious lines or even social
          lines. Real problem is non-existent of true democratic system in Iraqi
          administration and political system. Question is not whether Shia
          clergy or the Sunni power elite or Shias as a religious sect or Sunni
          as religious sect would administer the state functionaries and govern
          Iraq. Real conflict is</p>

          power. Iraq was declared a republic scrapping Baghdad pact and became
          an active member of the nonaligned group. During this period Iraq
          under Kasem harbored a very good relation with Soviet Union to equip
          Iraqi military with modern weapons. In 1963, in another military Kasem
          was overthrown by another military officer colonel Abdul Al Salam.
          During his tenure the Baath party was organized and came into power.
          The slogan of the Baath party has been for Arab unity, Arab aspiration
          and Arab nationalism. No wonder, the party became very popular among
          the common mass irrespective of religious beliefs and ethnic
          differences. It may be recalled that the Baath party was born in Syria
          in 1943 and since its inception it spread into many Arab countries
          including Iraq. The Baath Party came into power in Syria in 1963. In

          however be admitted that in spite of large scale discrimination
          against Shia majority and under represented in government posts, the
          Shias made substantial progress in almost all social fields including
          education, business and legal professions. During eighties, many Shias
          migrated from rural areas to cities, particularly in south, as a
          result of which cities like Basra and Baghdad acquired a significant
          Shia population. Many of these Shias continued to progress in the
          economic field i.e. in business &amp; industry as well as in the
          service sector. In the rural areas too the educational level of Shias
          came to approximate that of their Sunni counterparts.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In political arena before the
          Baath party came into power, Shias provided the bulk of leadership in
          the party, when the party was in opposition. Even as late as 1988,
          Shias had significant role to play in the party leadership. During
          those days, as for example among the top eight leaders who sat in
          Saddams Revolutionary Command Council, Iraqs highest governing
          body, <u>three were from Shia community</u>, of whom one was minister
          of interior, three were Arab Sunnis, one was an Arab Christian, and
          one from Kurdish national minority. On the regional command councils
          usually Shias had the majority. Even during the Iraq-Iran war, a
          number of highly competent Shia officers have been promoted to corps
          commander. The general who repulsed the initial thrust from Iranian
          side in 1982 was a Shia.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It must also be said in praise
          of the Shias in Iraq that in spite of the call by Iranian cleric
          government urging Shias for an Islamic revolution in Iraq overthrowing
          Saddam regime, Iraqi Shias stood behind Iraqi people. They never
          betrayed the cause of Iraq in spite of the fact they were not happy
          under Saddam-rule. To them Iraqi nationalism was more significant than
          the coreligionist feelings. The behaviour of Iraqi Shias during the
          war was excellent. Although about three quarters of the lower ranks of
          the army belong to Shia community, no general insurrection of Shias
          took place. Even when Iraqi regime faced a severe debacle of Al Faw in
          1986, the Shia soldiers defended their nation and the Saddam
          government staunchly despite intense propaganda launched by the
          Iranian Mullahs calling on them to join the Islamic revolution. It is
          the feeling of nationalism that inspired Iraqi Shias to rally behind
          the Saddam autocratic regime not out of love for Sunni dictator. Shia
          attitude proved beyond doubt that country is above sectarianism or
          religion. Shias of Iraq look upon themselves as Arabs first, not
          Persians, who were the traditional enemies of the Persians. The Saddam
          regime knew the feeling of Arab nationalism on the part of the Iraqi
          Shias. The regime very skillfully exploited this sentiment i.e. age

          unexpectedly, the Shias expected from Saddam regime that after the war
          the Shias would emerge as full citizens with their hope and aspiration
          integrated in the Iraqi nationalism reflecting their due participation
          in state affairs, government and non government. But soon they were
          disillusioned. Baath party was cleaned of Shia dominance and
          influence. Even the Sunnis believing in true secularism were either
          removed or eliminated from the party. Soon the party and the
          government fell in the hands of a coterie of inner circle with Saddam
          in the spearhead. It is alleged that Saddam even killed his two
          son-in-laws to make his seat of power safe. The present inner power

          kind directed against the Shia civilians. For this change in the

          from multi-metallic concept to monometallic concept one man was
          responsible- Saddam Hussein and his hunger for absolute power.
          Hussein, a Sunni Muslim in origin, who bases his power on family and
          clan loyalties as pictured above, did purge out the Shias from the
          ruling secular Baath party since 1988. It is alleged that he gradually
          excluded them from the bureaucracy and security service. Saddams
          elite crack armoured fighting forces- the Republican Guards are almost
          exclusively composed of Sunni officers and soldiers. Only in the
          poorly armed regular army is mostly manned with Shia infantry
          officered with Sunni army elite.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The policy of <u>Shia-purging</u>
          from the party and the state machinery based on a false allegation
          that we have always been accused of being pro Iranian, that our
          allegiance is not toward Iraq but toward across the border., says
          Mowaffak al Rubaie, a Shia activist in London. Strongly denying this
          allegation, he contented that common Shias do not trust any efforts by
          Iran to portray itself as a protector of Shia interests, partly
          because of bitter experiences during the 1991 rebellion. Many Iraqi
          Shias blame both the US and Iran for failing to come to the aid of
          Iraqis revolting against the autocratic regime.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Shia clergy, particularly their
          vocal organization The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution
          in Iraq (SCIRI), claimed that crimes of the Saddam-regime are
          countless and endless. But keeping aside their rhetoric and
          exaggeration here are some glaring examples of Shia repression
          systematically carried out by Saddam regime:</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It all started as a measure of
          retaliation against the Shias who involved in 1991 armed revolt with a
          view to overthrowing dictatorial regime of Saddam. On papers it
          appears that as if in response of a call of USA President Bush
          (senior), who made this call at a time when American forces were
          ruthlessly driving out Iraqi occupation army from the soil of Kuwait
          in February 1991, urging the patriotic Iraqi people to revolt against
          the regime, the disgruntled Shias took up arms against the regime.
          President urged that there was another way for the bloodshed to stop :
          That is for the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters
          into their own hands, to force, to force Saddam Hussein the director
          to step aside...... And many Shias heeded to that call. At the peak
          of the revolt that swept the country the regime almost lost control of
          14 of the 18 provinces. Fighting even spread in the capital. But as
          the UN sponsored ceasefire was agreed upon, the US support to Shia
          revolt was withdrawn. We buy some guns, but when he (Bush) felt
          that this is Islamic revolution, he told Saddam regime, use the aero
          plane, alleged Abu Muhammad, a top Shia leader.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Needless to say, fearing the
          chaos that could follow under pressure from Iraqs neighbours, the
          USA came to a ceasefire that gave Saddam and his military opportunity
          to crush the rebellion by using air force. Here are few examples of
          retaliatory measure taken by the Iraqi military against the
          revolutionists.</p>

          by a former director of Iraqi Intelligence Services, General Waqif al
          Samarae, the Iraqi military did use chemical weapons of light nature
          against the civilians of Najaf and Kerbala to crush the popular
          uprising of March 1991, which followed the defeat of Saddam in
          invading Kuwait.</p>

          </span></span>Following the crushing elimination of the uprising,
          large number of people took shelter in the Marshes of the southern
          Iraq. The Saddams military used chemical weapons against these
          fugitives and the innocent native people, commonly known as Madans in
          order to crush the so-called bases of the rebels. This operation was
          carried out in 1993 rendering thousands and thousands homeless and
          changing the ecology and environment of the vast locality.</p>

          systematic repressive measures and torture against the Shias and other
          section of the population. As for example from 1980 to 1994 many
          political assassinations were carried out even in foreign countries

          UAE, Sami Mahdi and Nlma Mohammad in Pakistan, Sayed Al Hakim in

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">A vast area located in
          southeast of Iraq, the great sprawling marshlands of old Mesopotamia
          straddling Iraqs border with Iran. This marshland was known as Al-Hawizeh.
          From time immemorial the inhabitants of this water-land build a
          social, economical and cultural life of their own, a distinctive
          characteristic reflecting the ecology of the area. Even a decade back
          from now the distinctive culture existed, but now if one visits the
          area it would appear a barren, drained and dry country, their
          water-born culture and way of life simply evaporated away in thin dry
          air once moistened and wet with water. The inhabitants, still left
          behind, dream for the better days they once had  a reedy,
          blue-water paradise where they fished, hunted birds, and tended water
          buffalos and other animals lived on water. Now there are only a few
          hundreds of villagers, who are among the last of the Madans, the five
          thousand year old civilization that is better known as the Marsh
          Arabs. The watery area of more than 30,000 km-square evidently offered
          a safe sanctuary to the rebels where they could take shelter beyond
          the reach of regimes tanks and helicopters has now been turned into
          an accessible but windswept desert. Their punishment for offering
          sanctuary to the rebellious guerillas had to be very severe, they had
          to be dispersed from their century old abodes with distinctive
          culture, history, tradition and flora and fauna. In the name of
          suppressing the uprising, the regime drained the entire marsh and
          turned it into a desert killing its ecology, environment and a
          5000-year-old Madan civilization.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Official version of the
          draining of Al Hawizeh say the government drained the marshes to get
          at Iraqs rich reserves of oil; to reclaim huge tracts of land for
          agriculture; to bring in modern facilities to the area  schools,
          health services to Marsh peoples of half a million. But obviously the
          last claim sounds ridiculous, as there are not many Madan people to
          receive these facilities as the population was pushed out of the area
          in the process. This massive project of draining out the traditional
          wetland and its associated vulgar scheme have turned the locality a
          desert, decimated the population and destroyed a way of life that had
          lasted 5,000 years. The government engineers dried the marshes as
          early as 1990, and in their place dug long and straight canals for
          irrigation work. The international environmentalists and humanists
          were not convinced with the government arguments accusing Saddam of a
          violent and vengeful act. It is no wonder that UNO human rights
          monitor for Iraq accuses him of <i><span style="COLOR: #3366ff">the
          environmental crime against the country</span></i>. And the UN
          environment programme, in a damning report last year, noted how canal
          banks had been built up to prevent any water flow into the marshes and
          concluded that the intention was simply to drain marshland dry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">And how derogatorily the
          indigenous were looked upon by the regime. The government media
          constantly making propaganda against indigenous population as
          impoverished, backward and immoral or even ignorant thieves.
          They were denounced for their viciousness, their dirty ways and their
          slatternly women. The Marsh Arabs are Shiite Muslims. This is all the
          more became a factor for suspicion in the eye of the government. The
          Madans got the full treatment at the hand of the government- their
          traditional homes destroyed and finally thee were decimated. The
          regime forgot that once these people fought for Saddam in his grinding
          war against Iran, but after the revolt the regime accused them of
          joining a dirty foreign conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          are no marshes any more- its all been drained. The people are in the

          inhabitant of marsh, now lives in a town, had this to say : every
          age has its beauty and ours was the marshes. We lived in a world of
          water and fish. Now I yearn for those days. For 10 years the marshes
          have been dry. Our sweet water has gone.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Many humanitarian campaigners,
          me included, believe the marshes could be recovered and the Madan
          people allowed to rebuild their culture. They have a unique way of
          life that is historic and we owe them every effort to bring the
          marshes back, said Baroness Nicholson, a Liberal Democrat MEP.

          violation of human rights committed by Saddam regime may be summarized
          as follows.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The repression and torture let
          loose by the Saddam government has been always comprehensive committed
          against all sections of Iraqi people- ethnic, religious, sectarian or
          cultural. For instance, Assyrians who are the native people of Iraq
          since the dawn of civilization and a tiny and peaceful Christian
          minorities have been subjected ethnic and religious cleansing although
          they never posed any threat to the ruling elite. Denominational
          persecution policy is another kind of genocide that the Iraqi regime
          has committed in central and southern Iraq. Discrimination and
          humiliation of Shiite Moslems through a series of articles published
          in the government newspapers following the 1991 uprising was a part of
          this crime, especially when it was declared that the Marshland
          residents are not Arabs or Iraqis and therefore the regime had the
          right to bomb their cities and destroy their homeland. The regime
          forgot that these people live in the area where the oldest
          civilizations evolved and where the old laws of Sumerians and
          Babylonians were written.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In Iraq, human values &amp;
          rights have been violated since 1968, when the Bath party assumed
          power under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, especially against the
          Shias, Kurds, and Turkmens. It is alleged that tens of thousands of
          Shias were rounded, deported and mass executed. Chemical weapons were
          used in 1988 against the Kurds. Draining of the Marshlands, destroying
          the ecology and environment, poisoning the waters and burning complete
          villages in the south are clear violations international laws and

              Hussein's yet another crime is his maltreatment against smaller
              ethnic and cultural minorities. In my previous writing I tried to
              describe the plight of human sufferings when he tried to
              extinguish a cultural minority group known as Madans or Marsh
              Arabs in an attempt to suppressing Shia uprising and development
              of a huge tract, a marshy land- Al Hawizeh, located north of
              Basra, the area now controlled by the British occupation force. In
              an attempt to drive away the people from their wetland-abodes
              Saddam regime drained of the marshlands in the name of reclamation
              of lands and introduction of modern irrigation system in the huge
              tract of land thus acclaimed. These marshland residents were
              declared by the regime as non-Arabs and even non Iraqis, the same
              way Pakistanis declared Kadiyani Moslems as non-Moslems, or the
              Islamic fundamentalists in Bangladesh under the patronage of
              Nizami-Khaleda government have been making hue &amp; cry now and
              then urging government declaring Kadiyanis as non-Moslems, and
              hence Iraqi government as if had the right to bomb their cities
              and destroy their identity and culture and their homeland. As
              early as May, 2001, in a report of UN Environment Programme of it
              confirmed that about ninety percent of the southern marshlands
              have disappeared from the geography of Iraq. The Independent in
              its issue May 19, 2001 observed :</li>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><span style="COLOR: #3366ff">Satellites
          now confirm it; the lands of the Marsh Arabs has all but gone. The
          marshes of Mesopotamia, the great historic wetlands of southern Iraq,
          which until recent years shattered a 5,000-year-old civilization and
          unique wild life, have been vanished, according to United Nations
          scientists. The result is a double disaster, ecological and
          humanitarian; not only has the world all but lost a unique freshwater
          ecosystem, the largest wetland in the Middle East, home to a host of
          specialized animals, birds, reptiles and fish; we have seen the
          virtual end of one of the world's most ancient civilizations, that of
          Madans, or Marsh Arabs, whose way of life has been documented since
          Sumerian times.</span>?</p>

          Minorities in Iraq</span></u></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><i>The Turkomans</i>: They
          numbering about 2 percent (~ 222,000 in 1986) of the Iraqi population
          are said to be settlers from Turkey. Ottoman imperialists had brought
          them in the area along the border between the Kurdish and Arab
          regions. They are village dwellers although, a good number of
          Turkomans live in the city of Irbil. The Turkomans, religiously most
          are followers of Sunni variant of Islam, speak a Turkish dialect
          preserving not only their old language but many of their tradition and
          culture too. Their old tribal organization however was lost.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The early Turkomans were
          settled at the entrances of the valleys that gave access to the
          Kurdish areas. It is alleged that they were brought to repel tribal
          raids, especially of the Kurds. This historic pacification role has
          developed to strained relations with the Kurds.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><i>The Yazidis </i>: Ethnically
          the Yazidis belong to Kurdish stock. However, they are distinct from
          normal Kurdish people as they follow a religion peculiar of their own,
          that evolved as a result of fusion of doctrines of three important
          religions, namely Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam and indigenous
          paganism. Concentrated in the Sinjar Mountains west of Mosul, they
          live in small and isolated groups following the indigenous cultivation
          and tending herds. Being religiopolitically, socially as well as
          geographically isolated the Yazidis tend to maintain a more closed
          community than other ethnic or religious minorities. <span style="COLOR: #3366ff">Because
          of their heretical beliefs and practices, they have been, historically
          subject to persecution and humiliation.</span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><i>The Assyrians</i> : The
          Assyrians, numbering about 133,000 only in 1986, constitute the third
          largest ethnic minority. Claiming to be descendants of ancient
          Mesopotamian peoples they live mainly in the major cities and in the
          rural areas of northeastern Iraq. Professionally as city dwellers they
          are businessmen and engaged in other professions befitting to city
          life, and as village dwellers they are farmer. Religiously they belong
          to Christianity attached to any of the ancient four churches, namely
          the Chaledean, Nestorian, Jacobite or Syrian orthodox, and Syrian
          catholic. The total Christian population constitutes almost 30% of
          Iraqi people, most whom are Assyrians.</p>

          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Although these small minorities
          practically do not possess, unlike Kurds or Marsh Arabs, any threat
          against the Saddam regime, they has been unduly discriminated and
          looked upon with concern &amp; suspicion. As for example Christian
          minorities numbering about 655,000 are docile and usually not
          persecuted in the same manner as Kurds or Shias, but the
          discrimination is obvious, although Tariq Aziz, Saddam?s deputy Prime
          Minister is a Christian. Even he, as a member of the Revolutionary
          Command Council is accused of complicity in war crimes against Iran,
          Kuwait and his own people. Many Christians, however, fear many people
          will be angry with them and associate them with the US-UK coalition
          forces. This is just an illustration how minorities are looked upon
          with suspicion by their majority neighbors.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">As regards Assyrians, a small
          ancient ethnic minority of Christian faith, are also subject to
          discrimination and unnecessary persecution by the Iraqi government of
          Saddam. Dr. Munther Al Fadhal, Legal consultant of Middle East laws,
          Stockholm, Sweden, accused the Iraqi government of committing
          genocidal crime against this docile small community: ?. the Assyrians
          who are the indigenous people of Iraq and a tiny and peaceful
          Christian minority have been subjected to ethnic and religious
          cleansing although they are not forming any threat or danger to the
          Iraqi regime.?</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Turkomans, as said earlier
          because of their Turkish origin, always have been treated with despise
          and condemnation- as they profess their own language and culture. The
          Bath regime since its coming to power in 1968 have been committing
          violations of human rights, especially against the Shias, Kurds and
          Turkomans.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText">Both Christian Assyrians and Moslem Turkomans
          hail from north Iran, an area of vast oil reserve in Iraq. This has
          become a fault in the eye of the regime. In order to control the oil,
          Saddam-regime has forced out many peoples from these communities to
          move so Arab loyalist groups to Saddam can be close to it. Is it not a
          crime against humanity ?</p>
