  <p align="justify">In my previous posting a brief account of Dinajpur bomb
  blasts was presented, in which at least seven bombs were exploded on Thursday,
  13<sup>th</sup> February, the day following Eid-ul-Azhah. More detail report
  is now pouring in. According to press reports appearing in most local dailies
  picture is becoming clearer.</p>
  <p align="justify">According to one report 10 bombs exploded within five
  minutes. According to the latest report reaching here the bomb explosion took
  place in a students' hostel run by an Islamic belligerent organization known
  as Jamiyatul Mujahedin. The explosion took place early in the morning of 13<sup>th</sup>
  February and shook the town within a radius of 1 kilometer. The hostel has
  been completely demolished as result of severe explosion. It is learnt that
  house in which the hostel was established located at the mahalla known as
  Chhoto Gurgola, was rented by one Hafez Shahidulla, an inhabitant of
  Kamar-Kachai mahalla, near the central bus terminal in the name of the
  organization at a monthly rent of Tk 700/- about four months back. Immediately
  after explosion fire was set in and many trees around the locality got burnt.
  The fire brigade people with the cooperation of local people brought the fire
  under control. According to the eyewitnesses many a persons with some injured
  people were found to flee away in a microbus and rickshaws. An injured young
  man of about 25 years, named Badal, believed to be a member of the
  organization, was found lying inside the hostel. Police took him to Dinajpur
  Medical College Hospital. According to the police source he came from a
  village Moymandora under PS Saghata in Gaibandha district. It is further
  learnt that injured persons first took shelter at the residence of Hafiz
  Shahidullah from where they were shifted to an unknown place by a white
  microbus. It is now known the so called students hostel is in fact a residence
  of the members of this fundamentalist organization. Although, according to
  eyewitnesses, there were 10-12 students used to live there only one was found
  injured inside the hostel. Rest managed to escape. Police however apart from
  injured Badal arrested other two youths namely, Farukh and Shafiqul Islam in
  this connection. They are detained now at the Kotwali police station and
  intensive interrogation continuing.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The inhabitants of the locality informed that the many
  unknown faced and mysterious people including borkha clad women used to come
  to the hostel. Microbuses and motorbikes ware found coming and going at the
  dead night. After the explosion police cordoned off the demolished house from
  where they recovered</p>

  <i>
  <p align="justify">Two Revolvers &amp; a pistol</p>
  <p align="justify">Few hundred rounds of bullets</p>

  hundreds of time bomb electronic circuits)</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Apart from these materials police discovered <i>receipt
  books for collection of subscription of the Jamiyatul Mujahedin Bangladesh,
  monographs dealing with how to rage armed assault, List of comrades and
  sympathizers, booklets of different armed organizations, bows and arrows, two
  mobile telephone sets, 40-50 pairs of shoes, and 70-80 pieces of clothing.</i></p>
  <p align="justify">The people of the locality however breathed a sigh of
  relief that it was good that bombs got exploded; otherwise these would have
  been used to kill innocent lives. People now are confident that in the name of
  running a hostel it was really a den of Islamic Fundamentalist's dreadful
  activity. The people of the locality wished that police would reveal the
  mystery and deal sternly with the culprits.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">But would the police and intelligence department would be
  allowed to work independently and impartially ?</p>

  <p align="justify">No body knows how the organization came into existence and
  how it is being funded. Is it just a local isolated belligerent organization
  or it is part of a greater network nationally or internationally connected ?
  It is learnt that the organization run different hostels and Islamic
  institutions such as Madrasas for girls, a Jikir training centre for women.
  The organization has 21 branch offices in the sadar Upazila itself. The same
  Hafiz Shahidullah took rented a house from one Shahid Hosain Ratan at a
  monthly rent of Tk 2,500 where in a women madrasa has been operating. In
  another locality known as Suihari, the same Hafiz yet took rent of another
  house from one Abul Hosen where in he has started the said Jikir training
  centre for the womenfolk. Some time back a report regarding questionable
  activities of the jikir centre was published in a popular national daily.
  There are other people like Hafiz Shahidullah who are either in their own name
  or under fictitious names running these type of activities of the organization
  Jamiyatul Mujahedin. In October last, Hafez Shahidullah and Kari Obaidul, an
  officer of Al Falah Alam (universal) Development Organization, rented a ground
  floor of a three storied building in Chhoto Gurgola and opened the madrasa.
  The demolished hostel, a two-room tin shed house was also rented by them being
  used as residence of the madrasa teachers, numbering seven or eight, said the
  eyewitnesses.</p>

  <p align="justify">A question has been peeping in the minds of the people how
  deep is the root of the Dinajpur bomb explosion ? Do the Dinajpur explosion
  have any connection with the Mymensingh Episode- or two are just isolated

  <p align="justify">It is now learnt that the injured persons could
  successfully escaped to first Rangpur medical college hospital under the very
  nose of the police and other intelligence people. It is alleged that they have
  been under cover brought to Bogra and then to Dhaka for treatment. How was it
  possible ? The name of the two injured who received medical treatment at
  Rangpur medical college hospital for 8 hours are Abu Bakar, s/o Enayetur
  Rahman and Tariqul Islam, s/o Abul Hosain; one of them is very critically ill.
  They were admitted to the hospital at 10:40 morning being carried there by one
  Sarwar Hosain of Mahimganj of Rangpur.</p>
  <p align="justify">The police have so far arrested only two persons. They are
  Mohammad Farukh Hoasin, administrative official of Ayesha Siddiqa Salafia
  Islamia Balika Madrasa and one Hafez Habibur Rahman alias Shafiqul Islam- both
  of them were placed under police remand by the lower court (Amli-2 adalat of
  first class magistrate) for ten days. Another arrested person injured Badal
  transferred to Dhaka Medical college hospital. The police have yet recovered
  two pistols.</p>
  <p align="justify">All the establishments of the Islamist organization
  Jamiyatul Mujahedin - the madrasas, training centres and hostels were found
  closed and the officials, administrators and inhabitants now gone to
  underground. In the mean while, the intelligence team now operating at
  Dinajpur has found a sketch in which names of some places and key wards such
  as <i>office room, Guard room, TV room, open space, grill etc. </i>The police
  think many such instructive books were lost.</p>
  <p align="justify">Dinajpur police superintendent disclosed to Daily Star that
  they have collected important information from the two arrested madrasa
  teachers. A 3-member team of CID led by ASP Atiqur Rahman Munshi sent from
  Dhaka and a police team led by Kotwali PS officer in charge Shahid Shukrama
  are jointly investigating the incident. The fundamentalist organization has
  been carrying on underground work in the region for more that a year, police
  believed. 3en</p>

  <p align="justify">It may be recalled that in the last year on 20<sup>th</sup>
  May Police arrested a group of terrorists carrying anti-state leaflets, six
  receipt-books, ten audio cassettes, four diaries, three registry books and 25
  petrol bombs from Parbatipur. They were &quot;Commander&quot; Sahabul Islam
  Sharif, Obaidullah, Lutfar Rahman, Mosharaff Hosain Julfikar, Anowar Hosen,
  Omar Farukh, Abu Bakar Siddiqu and Mostakim. The Dinajpur police suspect that
  those people are probably members of the same fundamentalist group as the
  receipt-books bear close similarity. Out of these eight this year on 7<sup>th</sup>
  February Mostakim and Mosharaff Hosen were released.</p>

      a house of one, known to be a local BNP leader, Hakim Mijhir of Char Kewar

    <p align="justify">Are these events really isolated or are organized work of
    a cleverly interlinked network of several terrorist groups committed to
    Islamic fundamentalism. We need to know the answer from our government. Yes,
    we are glad to know that our home minister has ordered his police force to
    reveal the truth of several bomb explosion taking place after the Eid
    festivals. We sincerely wish the police to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
