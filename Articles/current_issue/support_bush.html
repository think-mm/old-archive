          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I saw a lot of posting about the &quot;Operation Iraqi
          Freedom&quot; and unfortunately noticed that all most all of those are
          against the war and some people are even against President Bush and as
          well as America! I wonder why? All of those who are against the war
          will say univocally that, they want peace or will claim themselves
          'Peace-loving'. Fine, but only problem is that, that is not the fact,
          at-least not for everybody. I understand, why some Americans/Westerners' are against the war, they are real good people,
          never face the atrocities caused by the Islamic fundamentalists or
          terrorists. Americans &amp; Westerns' would never understand how
          heinous are the Islamists or terrorists if there were no 9/11. Surely,
          You people noticed that, all the fundamentalists &amp; terrorists are
          also against this war . I guess, somebody will say that, Saddam is not
          a fundamentalist! Well, a guy who built a mosque in his every
          birthday--what you will call him?</p>
          <p>Yes, I am in favor of this war. I am with 71% Americans. You know
          why? Because like all civilized people I don't want another 9/11.
          Actually I want President Bush to win the election again and finish
          the task he had started. That is, crush the Islamic fundamentalists
          every where in the world including Bangladesh. Somebody has to do this
          and Bush has started that and we need to support him. I know some
          people will say that, what is the relation between terrorists &amp;
          Saddam. Just watch, let the war finish, you may find Talibans/Chechen
          &amp; Kasmiri Separatists' /Bangladeshis(?) there fighting against the
          infidel(!) America. That is why almost all the Muslim countries and
          even its peoples (Even in US or West) support Saddam (Wrong Choice).
          See, all infidels (In their language) are not supporting President
          Bush, that is the beauty of the progressive world.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you a story: 3/4years before one guy told me, where is
          your Bush (senior), (Note that I am not registered as a republican or
          democrat) Saddam is still in power. There are plenty of people like
          that and of course, we should feel pity for them because those people
          say that from their fundamentalist point of view. Here again I have
          another reason to support the war, that is, may be in future civilized
          world need to go to the Muslim countries to change their rulers, the
          kings, the dictators, military juntas, like Iraq (Because someone has
          to show them the good). Have you noticed that, people from Islamic
          countries including Bangladesh (Not everybody, there are some
          progressives too in Bangladesh, some of my muslim friends support the
          war) enjoy the democracy, free sex, religious freedom, properties
          &amp; wealth etc. in America &amp; West and everywhere, but they want
          their own country to become an Islamic country!! (So that all infidels
          become their slaves??)(Please find me one muslim country where non-muslims
          are growing!!). So long the mentality is like that, America has to go
          to Afganisthan or Iraq or some where else. (Sovereignty? Bangladeshi
          religious minorities don't have that in their own country, and in
          almost no Muslim country, non-muslims have that!!).</p>
          <p>Either way, you support it or not, Saddam is history now. Who is
          next? Just today, my friend 'Kalam' (True but not the full name) told
          me: 'Like all Muslims are brothers, All Hindus are brothers &amp; All
          Christians are brothers too.' I told him, I never heard Christians
          saying that, All Christians are brothers.' If they say that, and tell
          us that they will not give wheat/food to non-Christians, then half of
          the fundamentalists will just die of starvation (They are civilized
          people and will not and can't let us die like that). Let me give
          another example: May be in 1988 after Islam become State-Religion in
          Bangladesh, in Dhaka, one detective had a friendly chat with me. He
          asked: What is your problem if Bangladesh become a Muslim country? I
          asked him the same question: Will you favor if India become a Hindu
          country? His answer was negative. I asked him: What is your problem?
          He told me that then the Muslims of India will lose their rights. I
          told him, you think about the Indian Muslims, but forget to think
          about the minorities of your own country! I told him: For the same
          reason I can't support Islamic Bangladesh---he told that he never
          thought like that. I know, in fundamentalist countries, the rulers
          don't allow its people to think pro humanity. Problem lies there.</p>
          <p>Solution of that problem is to support the war against terrorism.
          This war is also a part of fight against terrorism. Hopefully, after a
          few years the world will be beautiful again and we will not be asked
          to take off our shoes to board a plane for the sin of the islamist
          supremacists. There will be no Saddam, Bin-laden or Khomeni or even
          Kheleda to harbor the terrorists.</p>
          <p>Fall of fundamentalism or terrorism or barbarism is nearing
          everyday. Rise of humanity is all but certain. Lets' abandon evil and
          hail all the good of the universe. God willing, good will prevail.
          Thanks.</p>
          <p>God Bless You All.&nbsp;</p>
