          <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>Dr. Alamgir Hussain</b></font></p>
          <p>I had earlier <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/10481">replied
          to Mr Bishnu Dey</a> on the article &quot;My thought on the Iraq
          War&quot; expressing an opposing view when he tried to make a morally
          justified case (on behalf of America) about the ongoing war in Iraq.
          However, I have myself have been a staunch supporter of the War
          throughout run-up and continue to be. But I see this not as a morally
          justified case on behalf of either party involved but as a necessity
          on behalf of the Iraqi people. More precisely "<b>I see it as a
          necessary evil"</b>. Indeed "this war should been completed 12 years
          ago". And possibly a "lack of foresight" or will by Mr. Bush senior
          has landed us in this situation. I believe the world failed to judge
          the kind of resolve this animal Saddam possesses. An affluent nation
          has been turned to ashes thanks to his invasion of Kuwait over a
          decade ago. I have always been critical of imposing sanctions on
          nations because of the misbehavior of its tyrant leaders. I had
          earlier heavy-handedly criticized the US for putting sanctions on
          nations like Iraq and North Korea which has caused immense sufferings
          to the helpless people without doing a thing to the despotic leaders.
          The leaders have never starved for a day for the sanctions but the
          common people have been starving day in and day out.</p>
          <p>I was skimming through the pages of MM and read plethora of
          articles bemoaning the deaths of a handful of innocent/civilian Iraqis
          in the war. But can I ask these anti-war humanists how much thought
          have they spared for <b>"some 1.5 million"</b> children who have died
          for lack of medicine and malnutrition over the last 12 years. These
          kids are not innocents? The truth of the matter is, these huge number
          of children are dying a lot more difficult death than the few dying by
          the stray missiles, bombs and in crossfire. Why should one mourn the
          death of those hundreds and thousands of children: they aren't
          innocent!</p>
          <p>Indeed, many a humanists have put the blame squarely on the
          shoulders on US/UN-authored sanctions for the death of these children.
          I couldn't disagree but the question I ask: could the US/UN have done
          better? Saddam's name is associated with death of people, which may
          well count to a million or more. How a civilized world could embrace a
          man whose hands are bathed with blood of a million? Still quite
          shamelessly the world was ready to shake hands with this beast if not
          for his utter refusal to comply with the UN and give up weapons of
          mass destruction over the last 12 years. I would say, a chance for
          peace ended when Saddam expelled the weapon inspectors in 1998. Indeed
          a decisive war due right after. But the cruel world waited another 4/5
          years only to allow death of hundreds of thousands of children across
          Iraq. Has anybody bothered about those hapless souls?</p>
          <b><u>

          hypocrisy</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>I could say with confidence that those millions of so-called
          peace-lovers now-a-days swarming the streets of world capitals and
          metropolis against this war in the name of innocents being killed have
          hardly ever spared a thought for the agonizing death of over million
          children across Iraq over last 12 years. But today, their hearts get
          filled with endless pain seeing a handful of people dying (a rather
          simple death) because of the war. If this is not outright hypocrisy, I
          beg someone to teach me what hypocrisy is. And I have said this job
          should have been finished 12 years ago and <b>all supporters of this
          war</b> (not the peace-loving opponents) would agree to this than
          would anybody else. But the truth of the matter is, if the UN/US
          troops wouldn't have stopped when Saddam offered peace, these same
          peace-lovers would have swarmed the streets around the world the same
          way they are doing today because continued campaign to topple Saddam
          would have cost more civilian lives. We would have seen the same
          pictures - I can assure you of that.</p>

          : humanist peace-lovers best friends</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>It's surprising that the anti-war humanists have found their
          closest allies in China, Russia and France including many others like
          Pakistan, India and so forth. With the exception of France, (Algeria
          oppression comes to mind though)<b>China and Russia have been hotspots
          of flagrant violation of human values and rights in modern times.</b>
          The world hasn't forgotten what the Russian communist leaders did at
          the <b>Tienanmen Square</b> some 12 years ago. We just watched how
          Vladimir Putin's rampaging soldiers went on to a orgy of
          indiscriminate massacre in Chesnia leading killing of an estimated two
          hundred thousands civilians and freedom seekers. Pakistan massacred no
          less than a million civilians and freedom fighters in just 9 month in
          1971 in Bangladesh. One prominent case being made for this war is
          Saddam's use of Chemical Weapons against the freedom-seeking Kurds. I
          didn't see any difference amongst these atrocities, which ally Saddam,
          China's communists and Russia Putin in one camp and no wonder why they
          shouldn't take an anti-war stand. However <b>I have been intrigued by
          the French stand though</b>. At least part of Iraq's chemical and
          biological weapons came from France and it's probably guilty feeling.
          And it's also intriguing about France that even in 1991 gulf war,
          1994/95 Bosnia war and the most recent Kosovo war against Slovodan,
          they been a reluctant part all throughout.</p>

          <p><font color="#000080" size="4" face="Verdana Ref">American
          Hypocrisy</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>A lot of fuss has been whispered (including myself some time ago)
          about America itself being the creator of Saddam. I think it's more
          appropriate to say, America (other Western allies including Britain,
          France) was a bedfellow of Saddam for some time definitely not a
          creator. Saddam is a man of his own making who rose to the top as a
          hit-man, exactly the same way Hitler did. Hobnobbing of western
          nations with Saddam in the backdrop of the atrocities of Islamic
          revolution in Iran is definitely a mistake and I thought it would be
          stupid to stop US from realizing its mistakes. It's ironic that Iraqi
          people today are suffering from a quest of ridding Iraq weapons of
          mass distraction including chemical/biological weapons, which were
          loving gifts from US, UK and France for the beloved friend. But I
          would say it's better to do what needs to be done.</p>
          <b><u>
          <p><font color="#000080" size="4">American Interest</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>In the run-up to this war, numerous politicians (including
          American/British), celebrities (including Dustin Hoffman) and the
          man-on-the-street have reasoned loudly that nemesis of Iraqi people is
          the American oil being reserved under Iraq's soil. Just the other day,
          I was talking to a China friend and his outright reasoning was the
          poor US economy and hence America needs to occupy Iraq for its oil.
          However, I have time and gain failed to grasp the logic this notion is
          based on. To my limited knowledge of world history of past one
          century, I failed to find a single occasion when America has invaded a
          land for grabbing its resources. Of course, America has virtually
          ruled countries like Japan and Germany (and to some extent South Korea
          with heavy military presence there) since the Second World War. But I
          haven't seen any sign of America siphoning out the wealth of these
          countries. Had it been so, these countries would have been bankrupt
          with half-a-century's Blood-sucking by America. I have not seen any
          sign of that. Remind you, Japan is the second largest world economy,
          Germany is a wealthy nation and South Korea is one of Asia strong
          economy. Of course, Saudi Arabia is a case in contentious case in
          question but I find it hard to agree to the notion that America is out
          to grab Iraqi oil at the cost of hundreds of lives which it never has
          done.</p>
          <b><u>
          <p><font color="#000080" size="4">Democracy not for imposing</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>One of the themes of the war in Iraq is to bring freedom and
          democracy to Iraqi people. And nobody here would disagree that Iraqi
          people deserve better freedom and a lot better life. In this regard, I
          have heard a plethora of renowned pundits around the world (including
          many of my eastern and western friends) arguing democracy is not for
          imposing, it is to be flourished naturally. I wonder if those great
          pundits have opened their eyes for a minute to see around. Who is Asia's
          finest democracy? One need not even open eyes to see it is <b>Japan</b>.
          A country ruled by one of the most inhuman, murderous and despotic
          regime before arrival of the US has now transformed into Asia's best
          democracy. And without dispute, the next best democracy of Asia is
          South Korea, which also prospered over the last 50 years under the
          supervision of the US. And what about Germany? Should one still
          dispute, democracy is not for imposing.</p>
          <b><u>
          <p><font color="#000080" size="4">No business of America</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>While disputing over this issue of War, I have bothered more for
          the good of the Iraqi people than the Weapons of mass destruction.
          Many a friends have often come with the notion than America has no
          business to do here. It's the Iraqis who have to achieve it by
          toppling Saddam. <b>There's no instance of achieving freedom and
          democracy otherwise</b>. This is one thing that always irritates me.
          Something is not in the history and hence it shouldn't be attempted.
          It's like people used to send messages before via postal
          mails/telegrams and hence emails shouldn't be used to do the same
          today. Isn't it utter nonsense?</p>
          <p>About Iraq, everyone in this forum would agree that there will come
          a day when people will rise and go after Saddam. But at what cost on
          part of the Iraqi people? One simple calculation will do it. If people
          are to rise and achieve Iraqi freedom, it may cost a million lives
          instead of a few thousands (I don't think civilian casualties going to
          cross some 5 thousands in this war) in the US-led ongoing war. And how
          much time it could take 10, 20 or 50 years or even longer. The way
          Saddam's sons were shaping themselves up, another generation of Saddam
          offsprings were sure to rule this country. That simply means extreme
          poverty for Iraqi people for another 10-50 years or longer. And how
          about those hundreds and thousands of Iraqis who were to face inhuman
          tortures/death in the hands of the beastly regime. And of course,
          millions of children who would have been in line for definite
          agonizing death. <b><i>I don't just understand what kind of
          peace-lovers these anti-war heroes are who are ready to allow death of
          millions of Iraqis along with unlimited suffering instead of buying
          them peace at a very cheap price.</p>
          </i></b>
          <p>One last thing, I believe everyone on this forum will agree with
          America's immediate withdrawal from Saudi Arabia which indeed Mr Osama
          bin Laden is fighting for. But the truth of the matter is if
          US/British troops leave Saudi today, tomorrow Saddam will go and kill
          hundreds of thousands of Kurds who are enjoying a relative freedom
          under the Saudi-based US-British military protection over the last
          decade. It should be cited that when US/British backed off after
          pushing Kudrs/Shia's for a freedom offensive against Saddam in 1991,
          estimated 50 thousand Shias and 100-200 thousand Kurds were
          slaughtered by Saddam. Not only that Saddam has drained the otherwise
          fertile lands of Kurdish northern region into barren deserts by
          diverting the water flow of Tigris/Euphrates.</p>
          <b><u>
          <p><font color="#000080" size="4">It needs to be done</font></p>
          </u></b>
          <p>Many would agree, it's the US and allies who bear substantial
          responsibility for the suffering of the Iraqi people. It's also true
          that US/allies played villain once again when they incited anti-Saddam
          revolts amongst Shias and Kurds following 1991 war then by backing off
          which costed hundreds of thousands of lives and lead to inhuman
          torture on many more. That way US and allies lose a great deal of
          credibility when they now blabber about moral responsibility. However,
          this is a necessity to mitigate sufferings of the ailing Iraqi people.
          And of course everybody would argue there are more pressing and
          long-due issues like Palestine. <b>But I don't see much logic in why
          we shouldn't allow US/allies to solve the problem in Iraq just because
          they are not willing to solve the problem in Palestine.</b> Every
          problem being solved is good for the world and I will put myself
          squarely behind such move any time.</p>
          <p>Other problems that plague the world today include North Korea,
          Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), the regimes in Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia,
          India/Pakistan (Weapons of mass destruction; nuclear bombs) plus the
          paralyzing conflicts across Africa. However, US seems to have targeted
          Iran and Syria next without paying heed to more pressing problems. But
          I would like to see a United World take a sincere stand to solve all
          these issues one by one either by pressure or military means whatever
          necessary. That way, only the world could become a truly peaceful
          place. Probably that's how it's not gonna happen as reflected in US's
          choosing of next target. Of course, the most pressing problem in
          Afghanistan has been taken cared of. And now Iraq. Whoever be the
          next, it's only good for the peaceful world. Who knows? Maybe the
          success in Afghanistan and Iraq may lead to new line of thinking along
          the continual efforts to make this world a better place. And I'm
          always for it.
