          <p>I thank the moderator/s for allowing us to express our views
          through this debate. Mr response to Mr. Nalinakshya Bhattacharyya's comments
          are elaborated below:</p>
          <p><b>[Nalinaksha Bhattacharyya]</b></p>
          <p>Let your joy continue to enhance when you consider the following
          points:</p>
          <p>1. Taliban was built by US support. 2. The estimate of people
          killed in Afghanistan by bombing is about 20,000. Osama has not been
          killed. Thus the victims of Taliban has been killed by bombs. 3. The
          new found friends of US-the Northern Alliance are also equally
          cutthroat. 4. US dropped cluster bombs over Afghanistan. These cluster
          bombs were coloured bright yellow- the same colour as those
          compassionate food drops ordered by George W. 5.US treatment of
          Taliban prisoners violate Geneva Convention. One cannot claim to
          believe in due process, justice, equality, respect for law and such
          other lofty ideals unless one is prepared to grant them to the people
          with whose views we disagree. The people at Guantanamo bay has been
          kept there without any charges. Legally US govt. therefore has the
          same status as a kidnapper.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#000080"><b>[Bishnu Dey]</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">1. Taliban was not created by USA, as you
            seem to suggest. Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation was an
            indigenous dynamic. Many resistance groups fought against the Soviet
            occupation; Ahmed Shah Massoud, Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, Rashid Dostum,
            Burhanuddin Rabbani, and many other feudal landlords joined forces
            in their endeavor to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. Some
            where down the line, USA under Carter administration, primarily
            National Security Advisor, Mr. Zbigniew Brzezinski's formulated the
            a plan to give the Soviets a black-eye mainly motivated by the
            desire to &quot;get even&quot; following the Vietnam debacle. In
            addition, another foreign policy concern arose from the fear that if
            the Soviets succeeded in Afghanistan, they would one-day run over
            Pakistan, with the active assistance of India. This was a major
            concern, as the USA did not want the Soviets to have access to the
            warm waters of the India Ocean, which would have altered the
            geo-political balance in that part of the world.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">Reagan administration was far more
            motivated in seeing an end of the &quot;evil empire&quot;, thus they
            started to provide financially support and supply arms including,
            stinger missiles etc. to the Afghan Mujahideen through the Paki
            military establishments (primarily the ISI). At this stage, the ISI
            driven by its own motivation, created the Taliban and made it the
            influential force, through the use of US funds and armaments. In the
            early stages, the Taliban was a rag-tag group of fighters, and they
            did not display their fanaticism and fundamentalist leanings, but
            the influx of large numbers of Arab fighters, including Osama bin
            Laden quickly made this militant group into a religiously motivated
            paramilitary organization. The rest is history. After the eviction
            and execution of Najibullah, Rabbani became the president of
            Afghanistan for a brief period, eventually driven out of power by
            militias of the Taliban and Hikmatyar. Massoud and Dostum who were a
            part of the Northern Alliance were forced to retreat, as the Taliban
            captured power in Kabul, assisted by the ISI. Therefore, Taliban was
            not a direct creation of the USA, however, they benefited from the
            financial assistance and arms supplied through the ISI.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">2. I am not aware of the estimate that
            20,000 Afghans were martyred in Afghan liberation war. I will
            appreciate if you provide me some credible reference to such claim.
            I recall one incidence of bombing on a marriage party, which killed
            close to 100 people, and there were other stray instances of loss of
            civilian lives, but the majority of those eliminated were either
            Taliban militia men or their supporters. Besides, given that the
            population of Afghanistan is around 27.5 million, even if your claim
            is accepted for argument sake, I do not consider that to be a
            &quot;huge&quot; loss of life. Besides, many more Afghan lives were
            lost during violent struggles within their clans over the past 20-30
            years, compared to what you claim as a casualty count due to America’s
            liberation war of Afghanistan. Similar struggles in other parts of
            the world will show far larger fatality count. I will remind you
            that Bangladesh liberation struggle culminated in the loss of
            millions of innocent lives.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">3. Northern Alliance may or may not be a
            cut-throat, as far as the US is concerned, it was prudent on their
            part to use whatever assistance they could get from local Afghans to
            destroy the Taliban regime.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">4. I am glad the USA used cluster bombs in
            Afghanistan. Frankly, it matters little as to what bombs were used,
            or what the color of those bombs were, as long as those monsters
            that were responsible for the dehumanizing of the entire Afghan
            society, including their children and their women were eradicated
            from the face of this earth.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">5. Those interned in Guantanamo Bay are
            members of Al Qaeda and hardcore elements of the Taliban. Most of
            them are stateless, and were engaged in terrorism. These beasts were
            responsible for the killing of 2,700 of my countrymen, and they were
            not engaged in a so-called &quot;war&quot; with the USA when they
            attacked the World Trade Center. Therefore, the clause according
            protection to &quot;prisoners of war&quot; under the Geneva
            Convention is NOT applicable. It is thoroughly justifiable that
            terrorists be given the treatment they deserve, which is severe
            punishment. It is ludicrous to suggest that the US actions to
            capture the rabid Islamic fanatic jihadi terorists and interning
            them in Guantamo Bay, as &quot;kidnappings&quot;. Only brain-dead
            individuals will proclaim such, given that the world is a much safer
            place today with those vicious criminals out of commission.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">Now may I ask you why you are so
            sympathetic towards the Taliban and Al Qaeda elements? Why are you
            so aggrieved that the Taliban has been driven away from Afghanistan?
            If I am not mistaken, the country that you now reside in, Canada,
            was a part of the coalition that actively participated in the
            actions in Afghanistan. I wonder if you have voiced your opinion
            against the action of your government in it's role in driving the
            Taliban regime out of power in Afghanistan. I would much appreciate
            if you shared some evidence to that extent with us.</font></p>

          <p><b>[Nalinaksha Bhattacharyya]</b></p>
          <p>It will also be very wonderful to know your thoughts about the
          great leaders of your wonderful country who</p>
          <p>a) had supplied Saddam with all kinds of chemical and biological
          weapons, b) supported Saddam when he used gas against Iranians and
          also against Kurds, c) had incited the Shia's in 1991 ro rise against
          Saddam and then coolly stepped aside as Saddam massacred them, d)
          implemented a genocidal sanction against Iraq for the last 12 years
          and claimed that the price of half a million Iraqi babies were
          &quot;worth it&quot; (Madeline Albright), e)had showed the green flag
          to Saddam for invading Kuwait and then used this as a pretext to
          launch the first gulf war where the US army buried alive Iraqi
          conscripts and also killed Iraqi soldiers who were returning home.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#000080"><b>[Bishnu Dey]</b></font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">Given that Saddam was fighting with
            Khomeini led Iran, which at that time was considered to be a far
            more brutal regime, it appears logical for the USA to side with Iraq
            in the late 70s and 80s. For argument sake I could ask you to
            provide me references in support of accusation that the USA supplied
            weapons of mass destruction to Saddam, but to be fair, I concede
            that Saddam probably acquired some of the biological and chemical
            weaponry from the USA. Even if that were true, it was ultimately
            Saddam who used the mustard gas and other chemical agents against
            his own people, it was NOT the USA that &quot;gassed&quot; the
            Kurds. Why do you flinch from assigning the blame where it is due?
            Is it a requirement that in order to act and pretend like a
            pseudo-secular you will have go soft on elements like Al Qaeda,
            Taliban and despots like Saddam?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">Regardless of what actions the USA took
            following the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq, you will recall that the
            US led coalition built up the force over a period of 6 months. The
            Security Council took unanimous resolutions demanding Iraq to
            withdraw its forces from Kuwait, but Saddam did not heed to the
            collective demand of the entire world. All the Arab neighboring
            states supported the USA, even the Arab League passed resolutions (I
            believe in Rabat, Morocco) demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces
            from Kuwait. Saddam steadfastly refused to withdraw, and even
            threatened and taunted the coalition of States that Iraq will fight
            the &quot;Mother of all Wars&quot; against the infidels. Well, he
            did what he could and all the deaths that occurred in the liberation
            war of Kuwait in 1991 squarely falls on the shoulders of Saddam and
            his ruling Baath party which deliberately misled the Iraqis into
            believing that they were victorious in that war, despite the
            crushing defeat. Saddam had numerous opportunities up through the
            very last date when war ensued, to withdraw from Kuwait, thereby
            sparing the lives of the occupying soldiers and the Iraqi victims,
            but he didn't. Yet you continue to consider him your hero, ironic
            indeed!</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">I fail to understand why you continue to
            blame the USA when the entire world community wanted Saddam to get
            out of Kuwait! It is not like the USA unilaterally took the action
            against a &quot;peace-loving&quot; country to further its own
            interests! Even during this current war, Saddam was given an
            opportunity to comply with the UN resolutions, and eventually was
            asked to leave the country and go elsewhere. He could have spared
            Iraq a lot of misery, if he loved his country and his people. On the
            contrary he wanted to be a champion of the Muslims of the world, and
            decided to confront the USA and its allies militarily. It was HIS
            choice, and he is enjoying the fruits of his karma, why is this so
            upsetting to you Mr. Bhattacharyya?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">Let me ask Mr. Bhattacharyya that now many
            Iraqi Shias, Kurds, and other minorities of Iraq are overcoming
            their fear of the dreaded regime of Saddam and are actively
            participating in liberating themselves from the horrible subjugation
            that they endured over many decades, why do you consider it your
            right to go against those suffering Iraqis, who are for the first
            time seeing the hopes of a democratic state and sensing the taste of
            liberty?</font></p>

            <p><font color="#000080">a) The use of the nuclear bomb on Japan was
            justified primarily due to the fact that if that drastic step were
            not taken at the time, there was a danger that far more lives would
            be lost through conventional warfare in the Asian sector. Given the
            fact that the Japanese army was brutal and they were no &quot;spring
            chicken&quot; when they tortured, destroyed and killed numerous
            Chinese and South East Asians. Besides, Mr. Bhattacharyya, it might
            be useful to refresh your memories that it was Japan that declared
            war against the USA. Pearl Harbor attack was not a very friendly act
            on the part of Japan, would you not agree?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">b) Indictment is not the same as been
            proven to be a guilty party. Indictment is akin to being charged for
            some actions. Clearly, your Communist friends and the Sandanistas in
            Nicaragua were not peace loving and democratic forces. There is
            ample evidence that the Sandanista regime was actively engaged in
            training and harboring different leftist guerilla groups of Latin
            America and there was a danger that the entire Latin America would
            turn into a Communist stronghold if the Sandanistas were allowed to
            remain in power. The USA did whatever was necessary to destroy them.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000080">c) My country honors it's discoverer, why
            is that such a difficult idea for you to grasp? If you can revere
            Stalin after all his &quot;humanitarian&quot; actions, what is wrong
            with us celebrating Columbus Day? Why do you have to associate Mr.
            Columbus's glorious discovery of the new world with genocide?
            Moreover, if you find Columbus's discovery of this &quot;genocidal
            world&quot; so distasteful, why do you not shed your hypocrisy and
            return to the land of your birth, instead of reaping the benefits
            directly and indirectly derived from Mr. Columbus's discovery?</font></p>

          <p>If they are afraid to speak out their minds then the country is not
          free. And yes do tell me about their feeling of the sanctity of human

          compensation. You might like to read Rogue state by William Blum.</p>

            <p><font color="#000080">Mr. Bhattacharyya, perhaps I am not in a
            position to judge the mindset of the American people, especially one
            that senses danger, such as what they are experiencing currently. In
            the end, it might very well turn out that they are correct in siding
            with Mr. Bush in his effort in driving Saddam Hussein out of Iraq.
            Only history will tell what untold damage would have taken place if
            Saddam were allowed to be the leader of all the radical Muslims of
            the world, given that he still possesses large stockpiles of weapons
            of mass destruction. In addition to that, it is imperative that
            ever-larger numbers of Islamic fanatics and radical Arabs would find
            a new home in Iraq, having being driven out of Afghanistan. Like I
            stated earlier, I do support the actions of Mr. Bush, and I hope
            that the world will soon realize that in the long-run this war will
            generate far larger benefits for the Iraqis and the world in
            general. This war will also be an eye opener for aspiring dictators
            and other fanatical leaders that the world has changed since 9/11,
            and they will no longer have the free pass to act in manners not
            acceptable by the people of the civilized and democratic world.</font></p>

          <p>Read 9-11 by Noam Chomsky. Chomsky calls 9-11 a crime against
          humanity and a historic event because for the first time victims have
          used the method of large scale arbitrary violence against America. So
          far the method of large scale arbitrary violence has been used by
          Eurpoe and its offspring America.</p>

          <p>The Bible also says (inter alia) that someone who does not observe
          Sabbath should be killed. Read the genocidal passages in the Bible and
          then I hope you will also ask your genocidal, bible thumping President
          not to accept it as the word of god. I am not a Muslim, but the
          current hate mongering against muslims is motivated by racism and not
          by any informed scepticism about religious beliefs.</p>

            Christian and Protestant churches and other religious establishments
            of the non-Islamic world to render many of the violent and hateful
            contents relatively benign, as those societies increasingly adopted
            secularism. The same however is not true about the Quoran, which is
            accepted as the words of &quot;Allah&quot; hence accepted by the
            Muslim population at large as their holy duty to enforce its
            dictums. Remind you that the Quoran is the only &quot;words of

            Such and many other highly objectionable pronouncements have been

          <p>Good. then of course you must condemn the Eishenhour doctrine which
          stated that US shall defend Saudi Arabia as if it is its own
          territory. US has of course been behind the Islamic fundamentalist and
          corrupt Saudi regime. You must also demand that the people who trained
          and introduced Osam Bin Laden in Afghanistan -aginst a government
          which had women minsters- must be tried for crimes against humanity.
          And about Iraq- we can get some ideas about the future from what
          happened in Afghanistan. After all the chest beating about how they
          are going to bring &quot;freedom&quot; to Afghanistan, the Bush
          administration failed to provide a single dollar for Afghanistan in
          its budget.</p>
