          Neither a villain nor a savior&nbsp;</font></h3>
          <p align="center"><font color="#800000"><b>By Ali Sina&nbsp;</b></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America is but one
          country in a world of over 200 countries.&nbsp; Like any country,
          America looks after its own interests first. In its dealings with
          other nations, it has often demonstrated a disturbing willingness to
          sacrifice human rights for the sake of political expediency and its
          own material interests. Despite this, can you name one country that
          would not, given the requisite political and economic power, act in a
          similar fashion?&nbsp;All countries in the world have been guilty of
          some abuse of human rights, if not have also engaged in outright
          genocide against either their own citizens or those of other
          countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>America is not alone
          in this regard. The law governing the International relations is the
          law of the jungle. In jungle each beast is after its own interests.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>Therefore to blame America or only certain countries for the
          ills of the world is failing to see the trees because of the jungle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
          </span>To continue to do so can only fuel already existing hatreds as
          it fails to define the problem and by so doing limits the opportunity
          for any real and lasting solution. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Certainly
          it can be argued as well as shown that America is guilty of many
          crimes. For instance, it was America that enabled Saddam to poison
          Iranian children. I saw those children, in their mended shoes and
          dirty faces, and remember them running after a plastic ball playing
          soccer on the dirt roads of their villages. In thinking back, I can
          still hear the sounds of excitement and yelling, particularly their
          glee when shouting gooooal. I also remember the many shy little girls,
          who clutched their plastic dolls that often were missing a hand or an
          eye, hiding behind their mothers, peeping from behind their long
          skirts with their large eyes. Those little children are all now dead.
          They were killed by Saddam’s chemical and biological weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>America is in part to blame as it was they who assisted Saddam
          by providing him will all the satellite information and weather
          reports to inflict maximum harm and massacre the Iranian children in
          remote frontier villages.&nbsp;<O:P>
          &nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Yes this boils my blood. Yes this makes me angry.
          But instead of placing the blame and anger solely at America’s feet
          for what happened, let us retrace this history to see how it actually
          unfolded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When in 1979
          the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) took American diplomats as hostages
          and millions of Iranians were shouting “marg bar Amrika” , or
          death to America and were saying “Today Kabala, tomorrow Qods
          (Jerusalem)”, Iran was at the beginning of a revolution that would
          turn it into a rogue nation. The mullahs, or spiritual leaders of
          Iran, were not withholding or covering up their expansionist,
          political ambitions for Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Out
          of this revolution this new country, now the Islamic Republic of Iran,
          became upfront in its goal of exporting this revolution to other
          Islamic countries. In so doing this Iran suddenly became a threat to
          the peace and the security of the Middle East as well as to the rest
          of the world. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For this
          reason the IRI had to be contained or the consequences would have been
          too devastating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For this
          reason America was forced to choose sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>America chose to back Iraq, and its leader, Saddam Hussein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Though America had little choice but to make a bad choice, this
          does not excuse it for it becoming an ally and eventual partner in
          crime with Saddam Hussein. Such is the reality of politics where each
          country pursues their own interests.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"></O:P>
          It is true that America has supported many dictators and evil
          characters. The Taliban, the Contras and the terrorists in Nicaragua,
          were allies and agents of America. And the list goes on and on. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But
          America like any other country of the world is after her own
          interests. America is neither a villain nor a savior. It is a player,
          trying to make the most in an anarchic world. This is the world we
          live in and this is our reality. If you don't like it, don't blame
          America; let us instead change the world. America is playing by the
          same rules that your country and my country is playing, i.e. no rules.
          We are all abiding by the law of jungle. If it is not America it will
          be other countries.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">However, given the fact that America is a
          democracy, it is still better than most other countries. Imagine if
          Russia were the sole superpower of the world? Do you think the
          Russians would have respected human rights more than the Americans?
          What do you think would have happened if the Chinese were the sole
          superpower? What if an Islamic country had the power that the America
          has today? Can you imagine the disaster? Some of us would be dead as
          Kafirs and other would be paying jizyya as dhimmis. Suppose America
          stopped meddling in the world affairs. What do you think would be the
          scenario for the Middle East then? Madmen such as Saddam Hussein would
          be allowed to engage in their reign of terror virtually unfettered by
          outside control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
          such a condition people by the thousands would likely be killed, on a
          daily basis. Don’t forget that this man killed more than 30,000
          Shiites in Southern Iraq and massacred innumerable Kurds<O:P>
          after the Americans stopped bombing him in 1991.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">Let me say I hate America’s bullying as much as
          anyone else, but I dread even more to think what would happen were
          America to wash its hands of world affairs. Then nothing can stop the
          maniacal Saddams, Kims, Bin Ladens and Khomeinis of this world from
          indulging in wanton terror.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>Calling America’s military intervention in Iraq (both in 1991
          and 2003), in Yugoslavia and in Afghanistan terrorism is like saying
          that domestic police forces in every country are also terrorists
          because they bully the criminals and use force to subdue them.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution is contained in
          the problem. The world needs an international police force. In the
          absence of such a legitimate, worldly acknowledged peacekeeping
          authority, America is forced to assume that role. This is on one hand
          a burden on America and on the other hand a source of resentment for
          other countries. Despite this, America remains our last best chance
          for the majority to live in relative peace. So, if you are tired of
          seeing America being a bully, think of the alternatives. Without
          America the world would fall into the clutches of maniacal dictators
          like Slobedan Milosevic, Saddam and their ilk. This would bring far
          more death and destruction than America’s bullying alone.&nbsp;
          Therefore if you really care about justice, if you want equal rights
          for everyone, if you are interested in peace, and if you hate to see
          one country deciding the destiny of the rest of the world, strive to
          establish the World Federalism, and try to bring law and order to the
          international level. Work towards the demilitarization of the world
          and its disarmament. Make every effort to establish a word tribunal
          and endeavor to create a world peacekeeping police force. We cannot
          insist on anarchy and expect to have security at the same time.&nbsp;World
          Federalism means, every nation will maintain its autonomy but gives up
          the right to amass armaments and have military. Instead a new
          International body would be created that would protect the sovereignty
          of of all the nations, guarantee the democracy within every country
          and safeguard human rights worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <p class="MsoNormal">The problem facing humanity is disunity among
          nations and the solution to that is unity and that can be achieved
          through the creation of a federation of nations. Such unity will not
          be possible if there is no authority there to protect human rights and
          ensure justice. Just as there can be no justice or human rights if
          there is no authority protecting them. We need to revamp our thinking,
          revise our vision and begin thinking out of the box. If we have wars,
          it is because we have anarchy. Don’t blame America for starting a
          war to put an end to a ruthless dictatorship. If we do not do that
          now, for every life that may be saved today, thousands of people could
          be killed tomorrow. If you really care about peace, let us work
          towards world federalism, get rid of this lawlessness and let us
          establish the new world order. Let us make justice among nations a
          law. There is peace and order within democratic countries because
          there are laws that prevail and out of this also comes respect for
          human rights. So knowing what works, why would we as intelligent
          people allow our relations at the international level to be governed
          by the law of jungle? Therefore let us redesign this world so that the
          right becomes might and not the reverse, as it is today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<b><O:P>
