            <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->
              <p>I believe in this beautiful country. I have studied its roots
              and gloried in the wisdom of its magnificent Constitution. I have
              marveled at the wisdom of its founders and framers. Generation
              after generation of Americans has understood the lofty ideals that
              underlie our great Republic. I have been inspired by the story of
              their sacrifice and their strength.
              <p>But, today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of
              recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of
              America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of
              America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us,
              our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.
              <p>Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we
              demand obedience or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating
              Saddam Hussein, we seem to have isolated ourselves. We proclaim a
              new doctrine of preemption which is understood by few and feared
              by many. We say that the United States has the right to turn its
              firepower on any corner of the globe which might be suspect in the
              war on terrorism. We assert that right without the sanction of any
              international body. As a result, the world has become a much more
              dangerous place.
              <p>We flaunt our superpower status with arrogance. We treat UN
              Security Council members like ingrates who offend our princely
              dignity by lifting their heads from the carpet. Valuable alliances
              are split.
              <p>After war has ended, the United States will have to rebuild
              much more than the country of Iraq. We will have to rebuild
              America's image around the globe.
              <p>The case this Administration tries to make to justify its
              fixation with war is tainted by charges of falsified documents and
              circumstantial evidence. We cannot convince the world of the
              necessity of this war for one simple reason. This is a war of
              choice.
              <p>There is no credible information to connect Saddam Hussein to
              9/11. The twin towers fell because a world-wide terrorist group,
              Al Qaeda, with cells in over 60 nations, struck at our wealth and
              our influence by turning our own planes into missiles, one of
              which would likely have slammed into the dome of this beautiful
              Capitol except for the brave sacrifice of the passengers on board.
              <p>The brutality seen on September 11th and in other terrorist
              attacks we have witnessed around the globe are the violent and
              desperate efforts by extremists to stop the daily encroachment of
              western values upon their cultures. That is what we fight. It is a
              force not confined to borders. It is a shadowy entity with many
              faces, many names, and many addresses.
              <p>But, this Administration has directed all of the anger, fear,
              and grief which emerged from the ashes of the twin towers and the
              twisted metal of the Pentagon towards a tangible villain, one we
              can see and hate and attack. And villain he is. But, he is the
              wrong villain. And this is the wrong war. If we attack Saddam
              Hussein, we will probably drive him from power. But, the zeal of
              our friends to assist our global war on terrorism may have already
              taken flight.
              <p>The general unease surrounding this war is not just due to
              &quot;orange alert.&quot; There is a pervasive sense of rush and
              risk and too many questions unanswered. How long will we be in
              Iraq? What will be the cost? What is the ultimate mission? How
              great is the danger at home?
              <p>A pall has fallen over the Senate Chamber. We avoid our solemn
              duty to debate the one topic on the minds of all Americans, even
              while scores of thousands of our sons and daughters faithfully do
              their duty in Iraq.
              <p>What is happening to this country? When did we become a nation
              which ignores and berates our friends? When did we decide to risk
              undermining international order by adopting a radical and
              doctrinaire approach to using our awesome military might? How can
              we abandon diplomatic efforts when the turmoil in the world cries
              out for diplomacy?
              <p>Why can this President not seem to see that America's true
              power lies not in its will to intimidate, but in its ability to
              inspire?
              <p>War appears inevitable. But, I continue to hope that the cloud
              will lift. Perhaps Saddam will yet turn tail and run. Perhaps
              reason will somehow still prevail. I along with millions of
              Americans will pray for the safety of our troops, for the innocent
              civilians in Iraq, and for the security of our homeland. May God
              continue to bless the United States of America in the troubled
              days ahead, and may we somehow recapture the vision which for the
              present eludes us.

                <p>George W. Bush<br>
                1600 Pennsylvania Ave.<br>
                Washington, DC
                <p>Dear Governor Bush:
                <p>So today is what you call &quot;the moment of truth,&quot;
                the day that &quot;France and the rest of world have to show
                their cards on the table.&quot; I'm glad to hear that this day
                has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived
                440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could
                take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day,
                'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:
                <p>1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters
                and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on
                this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in
                America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about
                wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO
                Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has
                even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average
                Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a
                threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to
                kill him! Funny how that works!
                <p>2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected
                you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We
                know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and
                none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us:
                two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the
                stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their
                retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two
                dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make
                any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to
                improve.
                <p>3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck
                to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole
                world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans
                among them.
                <p>4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The
                Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against
                you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are
                an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you
                personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL
                while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.
                <p>5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of
                South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed
                forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send
                your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don
                their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of
                Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids
                for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so?
                Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!
                <p>6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal
                screw-ups. Yes, some of them can pretty damn annoying. But have
                you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as
                America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in
                the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest
                thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin,
                etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the
                concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our
                Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of
                Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of
                French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing
                what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about
                yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank
                them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should
                have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your
                ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has
                painted you into a corner you can't get out of.
                <p>Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through
                with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm
                guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their
                lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you &quot;win&quot; the
                war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as
                everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good
                ass-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some
                third world ass!). So try your best to ride this victory all the
                way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways
                away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we
                watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!
                <p>But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days
                before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope
                alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!
