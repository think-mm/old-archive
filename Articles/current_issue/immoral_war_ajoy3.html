              or for that matter Saddam's most heinous crime was to commit an
              aggression against Iran in 1980. To be precise, the war broke out
              on September 22, 1980, when President Saddam's crack troops
              launched a full-scale invasion of Iran. Iran was then under the
              fundamentalist regime of Ayatollah Khomeini, only recently came to
              power through bloody Irani-band Islamic revolution. The regime was
              then internationally isolated. The secularist world looked upon
              Iran with great suspicion. Denial of Freedom of movement of women,
              negation of right of women, observance of Purdah system (i.e.
              covering of whole body with cloth), discrimination between
              different religious sects i.e. between Shias and non-Shias became
              the rule of the country. A new kind of Majlish-based democratic
              system infested with religious doctrines was introduced almost
              completely unintelligible to liberal democrats enriched with
              western concept. Taking advantage of existing international
              isolation of Iran, President Saddam hoped for a lightning victory.
              But Saddam?s dream remained unfulfilled despite Iraq's initial
              success. The Iranian people, even under theocratic regime, rallied
              and, using their numerical superiority in population, if not in
              striking power, were able to halt the Iraqi aggression and push
              the invaders out by mid- 1982. In fact by the end of May, 1982
              Iran had recaptured nearly all its territory and Iraq was looking
              for a way out. The Iranians then went to offensive whose troops
              crossed over to Iraqi territory on the other side of the <i>Shatt
              al Arab</i>. The attempts on the part of the Islamic Organizations
              like the Islamic Conference and the Gulf Cooperation Council to
              mediate a settlement failed. Even Iraq's offer to withdraw its
              remaining forces from Iran and to cease-fire was rejected by
              Islamic clergy led regime of Iran. The militant mullahs had seen
              their power to grow during the war; though the Shah had originally
              been dethroned by a wide spectrum of political forces, the crusade
              against Iraq had enabled the right wing clerics to mobilize the
              population in their favour, thus curbing effectiveness of the
              power of the domestic opponents, more particularly of secularists.
              Khomeini decided to go on with the war, declaring that Iran would
              not stop fighting until Saddam was overthrown Iraqi war-guilt
              assigned, and reparations paid. However Iraq with a significant
              advantage in heavy weaponry successfully throttled a decisive
              Iranian breakthrough. Then followed an indecisive war between the
              two countries for long six years. Finally, Iran?s all-powerful <i>virtual
              monarch</i> Ayatollah Khomeini was forced, with initiative of the
              then UN secretary general, to accept the US drafted Security
              Council resolution (598), as Iranian anti-war sentiment growing
              widespread. Iraq although indicated earlier that it had accepted
              Security Council Resolution 598, made some dilly dally till
              August, but under international pressure also accepted the
              ceasefire. In one ward the result of Iraq-Iran war of eight years
              might be termed as <i>non-exciting draw</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
              </span>What were the casualties? While there is no one definitive
              estimate, several have been made with nearly all placing the
              figure well over 100,000 (on each side), many more wounded &amp;
              disabled, and millions were made refugees. According to US State
              department estimate the war had created 2 millions refugees, not
              to speak of immense economic sufferings to citizens of both
              countries and malnutrition to millions of children and women. From
              economic point of view both countries incurred a tremendous loss
              of oil revenues. But even then after the Gulf war both regimes
              continued reign of terror including killing over their political
              dissidents and opponents, and smaller nationals like Kurds in Iraq
              and secularists, especially leftists in Iran. But in the measure
              of severity and cruelty the Iraqi regime by far outweighed the
              Iranian rulers.</li>

          as summarily enunciated above, the immediate or the principal cause
          was access to. and control of, Shat al Arab waterway. It may be
          mentioned here that Control of the waterway and its use as a border
          have been a source of contention between various states in the region,
          more particularly Iraq and Iran since The Peace Treaty of 1639. The
          peace treaty agreed upon by the Persians and the Ottoman Empires is
          rather ambiguous in a sense it failed to resolve the irritating
          conflict even to this day. Iraq was at that time under the Turkish
          Ottoman Empire. <span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: maroon; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Right
          to have access to waterways of Shat al Arab, the only way to outside
          world through sea is a vital importance for Iraq, being a land locked
          country, for its economy and sea trade. Hostility between Turks and
          Persians again broke out in the 1800s, which eventually brought
          another peace treaty known as in history <i>The Second Erzerum Treaty
          of 1847</i>. But problem continued as the treaty failed to demarcate
          areas on both sides of Shat al Arab between Iraq and the Persia. The
          Turks occupying Iraq continued to claim the entire area on both sides
          of the river belonging to them. The treaty itself had built in
          weakness as it ?suffered from a central weakness : it remained largely
          nebulous in its working and was unclear about the course of the border
          in the Shatt al Arab region, thus leaving unresolved the question of
          territorial responsibility for the eastern bank of the river.? (See<i>
          </i>article<i> The Historical Antecedents of the Shatt al Arab Dispute</i>-by
          Peter Hunseler, in<i> The Iran-Iraq War: An Historical, Economic and
          Political Analysis,</i> ed. M. S. El Azhary, St Martin?s Press, New
          York, 1984). This led to another understandings between the contesting
          parties named as <i>The Constantinople Protocol of 1913</i>
          establishing a ?Commission? with a responsibility to mark the border.
          But before the Commission could complete its task the World War I
          began jeopardizing the mission. The end of War saw a major change in
          political entities in mid-east. The Turkish Empire collapsed and Iraq
          emerged as a new independent political entity. This was the first time
          that the dispute was placed in an Iran-Iraq context. A fresh treaty
          between Iraq and Iran in 1937 with a commission to determine the
          border around Shat al Arab region in 1938 was signed. But little
          progress was made. In 1950, Iraqi monarchy was dethroned by a bloody
          military revolution. The pact was shelved. Sporadic arm clash
          continued between two countries. However by 1969 the situation changed
          in favour of Iran militarily under the Shahs. On the other hand Iraq
          came under the ruling of Ba?th party who were domestically tied up to
          consolidate its power base in Iraq. It has also been alleged that Iran
          supported at that time the Kurdish uprising in the northern region of
          Iraq and almost brought the two countries to the verge of open
          warfare. This was however successfully averted through yet another
          treaty <i>The Algiers Agreement of March 1975</i>, which was forced on
          the Iraqi?s due to their inferior military position. According to the
          treaty the border between Iraq and Iran in the region of Shat al Arab
          would be the mid stream of the Shat al Arab River. Later on Iraq under
          President Saddam rejected the treaty claiming entire area of both
          sides of the Shat al Arab. This set the stage for conflict that would
          erupt in 1980. While Iraq wanted access, in regards to navigation
          rights, to full width of the river as it crucial to its sea trade

          both the countries, but this is more so to Iraq. It is needless to say
          that for the Iraqis unhindered or full usage of the waterway and the
          small stretch of Iraqi territory debouching on the Gulf is seen, in
          economic and security terms as vital. This is because as pointed out
          earlier the Shat and the small stretch of land is Iraq?s only outlet
          to the Persian Gulf and thus the shipping lanes needed to export its
          primary resource, oil. The Shat al Arab itself is an irritant cause of
          conflict for various reasons. Firstly, it allows for agricultural
          production in an area with a dry and humid climate. The waterway
          provides a means of transportation for moving agricultural and other
          products both within the country and to ports for export. The later
          one is strategically most vital to Iraq, a land-locked country</font>.

          Iran, especially under the Pahalvis, claimed to be the proud inheritor
          of ancient Persian Empire. The Iranian Shahs called themselves
          Aryameher meaning Aryan Sun. Bulk of the population of Iran ethnically
          belong to so called Indo-Aryan race and Persian Language is an
          important member of a great Indo-European language-family. Persian
          culture, literature, architecture and other finer aspects of life are
          much richer and sophisticated. Iranians feel proud of their ancient
          history, culture and tradition. The Saracens, torchbearer of Islam
          emanated from nomadic Bedouins of the Arab Peninsula,</font> <font size="2">defeated
          them militarily but Persians never surrendered their cultural
          superiority, language and past history to the conquerors. Arabs
          defeated Persians militarily but accepted defeat culturally and
          linguistically. Let us remember here very briefly how Arabs
          overwhelmed the different non-Arab, non-Islamic countries including
          Persia one after another within a hundred year of demise of the
          Prophet Muhammad (Sm), the founder Islam. In March, 635 Damascus, in
          January 637 Jerusalem, in March 637 old Capital of Persian</font> <font size="2">Empire
          Al Ma?daine fell. Entire Mesopotamia was conquered by 638 AD; Egypt
          became part of Arab Empire in 640-41;</font> <span style="COLOR: red">completion
          of conquer of Persian Empire took place between 642-43 AD during the
          caliphate of Omar (634 ? 644). </span><font size="2">At this time
          Persian Emperor was Yazdigard III, and epic hero Great Rustam led
          Persian Army. Rustam was defeated in a fierce but decisive battle
          Kadesia by the Arab army led by Sa?d bin Abi Waqqas. The Capital
          Ma?daine (Ctesiphon) fell in the hands of victorious Arabs. But as we
          said the Persians although accepted the military defeat they
          maintained the cultural superiority even they accepted Islam as their
          new religion. And Iran became the cradle of Shiaism, the main opponent
          of the more dogmatic sect called Sunni Sect. Let me give an example
          how Persians reacted when Islamic lunar calendar, Hijri<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
          </span>was imposed on the conquered people in their civic life
          replacing the old Persian solar calendar, they resented it very much.</font>
          <font size="2">They continued to observe Nowroze (New year) as per old
          solar calendar instead of Muharram, the Islamic first month. In the
          year 1074-75, the Persian Emperor Seljuk Sultan Jalaluddin Malek Shah
          asked the famous poet astronomer-mathematician Omar Khaium and seven
          other men of learning to reform the old Persian calendar in the light
          of the latest development in astronomy and introduced this new
          modified solar calendar replacing the Hizri. Old Persian months were
          revived replacing the Islamic names of the months. The new calendar
          was introduced 10<sup>th</sup> of Ramadan in 471 Hizri (16<sup>th</sup>
          March of 1079 AD). The Iranian Calendar became known as</font> <font size="2"><i>Tarikh
          i Jalali</i>. This is just one example how Iranians rejected the
          Arabic military supremacy by their cultural superiority.</font></span></h2>

          750-1258 AD, the most glorious period of Arab rule. The Abbasid rule
          more particularly under the Caliphate of Harun ar Rashid (786 ? 809

          philosophy and astronomy. More significantly they restored the lost
          Greek contributions to Science and philosophy anew. The second Caliph
          of Abbasid dynasty, Al Mansur (754 ? 775), one of the most capable
          Caliphs of Abbasid, established a new city Baghdad as its capital.
          From pure defense and security point of</font> <font size="2">view the
          farsighted Caliph shifted the capital from the old city Hashemia,
          being situated between Syria and Kufa exposed to the enemy of the
          newly established dynasty. The new city of Baghdad was build on the
          western bank of river Tigris, not very far from ancient city Babylon,
          located on the western bank of river Euphrates. Soon the city became
          famous for its beauty, estheticism, cultural sensuality and prominent
          international business and trade centre well connected with river
          system and road. Soon a new art and architecture style developed
          centering the construction and development of Baghdad. The city of
          Baghdad became known as <i>Dar us Salam</i> or Abode of Peace. During
          the period of Caliph Harun ar Rashid it became simply wonderful and
          its fame reached every corner of the then world- <i>a city with no
          pair throughout the whole world</i> is not just a paper-claim. Modern
          Iraqis surely can feel proud to inherit that old tradition. It may be
          recalled here that great Caliphs of Abbasid dynasty were followers of
          Sunni sect of Islam, more particularly Sunni Hanafi community. However
          the caliphs were liberal in regard to various sects of Islam
          prevailing at that time in Iraq. By and large the traditional Sunni
          dominance in administration of Iraq prevailed although rulers had
          changed. At the same time Iraqi</font> <font size="2">people
          maintained their time honoured tradition of living together with peace

          party, the Ba?th regime, is secular while the Iranian government is a

          are of Aryan stock, but population on both sides of Shat al Arab is
          mostly of Arab origin. This is one of that factor on the basis of
