          against Kuwait is yet another example of his international crime.
          President's chauvinism found expression when he in order to show his
          military-might invaded Kuwait in 1990, a small gulf state. It appeared
          the autocratic ruler has not learnt any lesson from invasion of Iran,
          which brought immense sufferings to his own people apart from millions
          of casualties during 1980-88. This is simply madness on the part of
          the dictator and uncalled for. Even his closest ally or friend Syria
          or Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat did not endorse this adventurism of
          Saddam. Agreed, Iraq all along after the creation of Kingdom of Kuwait
          could not swallow its continued existence. The fault of Kuwait in the
          eye of Saddam lies in the following facts:</p>

          monarchism, its people have no taste of democracy and no share in the

          democracy based on Arab nationalism &amp; aspiration it has the moral
          right to free the Kuwaiti people from the imprisonment of the Kuwaiti
          Ruler and his few aides. So in Saddam?s eye Kuwait-operation was an <i>operation
          freedom</i> and union of breakaway Kuwaiti people with mainstream of
          the great Iraqi People. To Saddam it is the same thing as breaking
          down of Berlin wall and union German brothers on both sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

          historical reasons can Iraqi Government under Saddam morally justify
          attack of Kuwait? The present Iraqi leaders should remember that the
          modern Iraq was also a creation of the victorious Allied forces after
          the World War I (1914-18) came to an end, with active cooperation and
          conspiracy of some Arab leaders who helped the Allied forces against
          the Ottoman rulers. During the war the British imperialists instigated
          the Arab rebels to take up arms and in fact had led the Arab forces
          against the Ottoman Empire, promising the Arabs independence if the
          Ottomans were defeated. With the defeat of the Ottoman power and its
          allies (Germany and Austria-Hungary), the British chalked out a new
          plan for the ancient Mesopotamia, creating Iraq, a country whose
          population included Arabs with two major religious divisions (Shias
          &amp; Sunnis) and non-Arab ethnic people of different tribal
          allegiance.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">If imperialist occupation of a
          territory in the historical past becomes a legal or moral basis to
          claim the territory then political geography of the present day world
          would have to be changed drastically. Can modern Turkey, the successor
          of Ottoman empire, claim its suzerainty over entire modern Iraq ? In a
          similar logic, Afghanistan can claim the entire Pakistan as once
          Afghan rulers like Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni or Ahmed Shah Durani
          occupied entire territory now constituting Pakistan from the falling
          Mughals ? Or can modern India claim Afghanistan as part of India as it
          was once a part of greater Bhratvarsa or <i>Jambudwipa</i> ; or can
          India put its claim over Myanmar- because once it was under the
          British India, which modern India claims to be its successor? I cam
          cite hundreds of such instances from history. Hitler in the beginning
          of Second World War championed the so-called Aryan nationalism (?) and
          greater Germany. Saddam, claimed to be champion of democracy and Arab
          nationalism, precisely tried to follow the footsteps of Hitler. When
          he had denied democracy in his own country, he had no moral or ethical
          right to invade Kuwait in the name of freeing those occupied (!)
          people. In Bush occupation of Iraq, Iraqis showed little enthusiasm in
          hailing the coalition force as their liberators, the same thing
          happened during Saddami occupation of Kuwait, - the Kuwaitis did not
          come down to streets hailing the Iraqi invaders as their liberators,
          nor they led any uprising against the Shaikh to overthrow him from the
          state war. In fact the war once again turned to be boomerang for
          Saddam. For his childish chauvinism Iraqi people paid very dearly and
          finally Saddam was brought down by Anglo-US coalition force in 1991
          when Iraq was forced to sign ceasefire under heavy US led forward
          thrust on Iraq with day-out day-in continuous missile and air
          onslaught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Hence none of the arguments
          stated above could be entertained in favour of Saddam?s invasion of
          Kuwait in 1990. We may put forward that in order to divert the
          attention of his supporters at home and common masses of Iraq Saddam
          had to find some way. The people of Iraq was getting impatient with
          Saddam?s regime because of its autocratic rule devoid of any seed of
          democracy, suppression of opposition voices and criticism, failure to
          solve Kurdish problem and failure of putting down Shia resentment
          effectively. And he thought that his countrymen forgetting their
          internal &amp; domestic problem will hail invasion of Kuwait, and he
          would emerge as national hero. But alas, apart from a handful of his
          supporters in the power elite, general mass was silent and even
          critical of this chauvinism. Even we keep in mind that there exits
          border problem of very complex nature between two neighboring
          countries and other form of intricate problem, in no way thrusting a
          unilateral solution in the form of military adventurism could be
          supported either from moral stand or from pragmatic view. War always
          bring immense sufferings, introduce newer elements and increase the
          dimension to existing problems. Many experts in middle east affairs
          tend to lend support to Saddam?s action of applying force to solve so
          called Iraq-Kuwait problem on the plea that that the problem is much
          more complicated and complex. They even call the worldview held by
          most of the member-countries of UNO and the view held by the Security
          Council ?greatly oversimplified, a one dimensional portrait, lacking
          in context and nuance?. For the sake of neutrality let me express
          their views briefly.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">These pundits extend academic
          support to Saddam?s unilateral invasion of Kuwait on the following
          grounds.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">They traced the origin of
          stringent relation between the two countries in remote past opining
          that Kuwait had once been a part of Basra during the Ottoman rule, and
          only became a separate country while under British control. This view
          holds that the many decades of struggle to resolve the boundary issue,
          repeated attempts by the Arab states to mediate according to Islamic
          traditions (!) of consultation and peaceful resolution within the
          faith just failed and they accuse Kuwait rather than Iraq for the
          failure. It is further contended that Saddam?s war with Iran how
          exacerbated the boundary tensions. And because of long drawn war with
          Iran Iraq badly needed oil revenue to repay wartime loans and to
          rebuild its economy, but Kuwait- these mid-east analysts alleged that
          Kuwait persisted in pumping far beyond its OPEC quota (?), driving
          down prices, and thus costing Iraq billions of dollars of revenue.
          These analysts charged Kuwait openly for foiling Arab attempts to
          mediate this clash over oil prices as well as longstanding boundary
          dispute, frustrating efforts to resolve this crisis by peaceful means.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Needless to say these views are
          the typical arguments the Saddam regime have been put forwarding in
          justification of its immoral action since Iraq occupied Kuwait in
          order to solve once for all tradition-bound historical boundary
          problem. I have already refuted earlier the arguments of the regime
          and the scholars supporting his stand- searching justification in
          history, legacy and failure of Islamic tradition of peaceful
          mediation. If Kuwait is pumping far beyond (- how far beyond ? ) OPEC
          quota, the OPEQ countries were to look into this problem and take
          measure against Kuwait, not Iraq. The OPEC is there to look after the
          interest of each member countries and monitoring oil prices. The rise
          of oil price affects not only the oil producing nations but it
          severely hits world economy, more particularly of Asian and so-called
          least developed countries. Therefore it is the business of OPEC and
          Arab league to fix oil price in the larger context of world reaction.
          Since Iraq needed his revenues from her oil resources because of its
          own make economic disarray as a result of adventurous invasion of
          Iran, measures must be taken to raise the oil price is a childish
          argument. Iraq had to pay for its misdeeds. And look, how treacherous
          the Saddam-regime is- Kuwait advanced billions of dollars loan to Iraq
          for rebuilding its war shattered economy, and the same Iraq paid back
          its gratitude by pushing in its army into the territory of Kuwait, the
          beneficent !</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">As regards history, I have
          already put forward fallacies against such reasons. If we are to take
          into account of history of conquering one country by another, as I
          said earlier, the modern Iraq, which never existed before 1921, should
          be a province of greater Turkey. I may just add another historical
          fact here- before the advent of Islam to old Mesopotamia, the Persian
          Emperor Kiros conquered the city of Babylon in 538 BC, and then during
          the reign of powerful Persian Emperor Darius (6<sup>th</sup> century ?
          beginning of 5<sup>th</sup> century BC) the vast track of lands
          extending from the river Sindh in India to shores of Nile in Egypt
          came under his empire. If historical arguments are to be followed as
          Saddam intended with the support of some scholars, the Iraq or Old
          Mesopotamia should be an integral part of modern Iran. Such is the
          history. As regards creation of Kuwait as an artificial state by
          British, as I pointed out earlier so also the present Iraq. On this
          argument Saddam has no right to wither away a member state of UNO by
          annexing its territory to his own interest. If arguments of such
          thinking are extended then Pakistan is also an artificial state, and
          as such no right to exist ! And many African states would fall in this
          class of ?artificial states?.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">As regards pumping of oil,
          Kuwait was siphoning off crude oil from the Ar-Rumaylah oil fields.
          This enraged Saddam regime as it considered these sites are within the
          territory it had historic claim. Regarding keeping down oil prices why
          these experts of middle east singled out Kuwait is not readily
          understood (or perhaps Kuwait was singled out as a target because it
          was a militarily weak country compared to might of Iraq), when Saddam
          himself accused all the Persian Gulf states of conspiring (against
          Iraq ?) to hold down oil prices, thereby damaging the interests of
          war-torn Iraq and catering the wishes of the Western powers. The Iraqi
          government in fact went a step further, when its foreign minister
          insisted that Kuwait, Saudi Arab, and the gulf emirates make partial
          compensation for these alleged ?crimes? by canceling 30 billion US
          dollars of Iraq?s foreign debt. This was the immediate premise of
          attacking Kuwait as when these allegations and demands were being
          made, meanwhile 100,000 of Iraq?s best troops concentrated on the
          Kuwaiti border. In brief a frustrated Saddam Hussein turned his sights
          to the wealthy but vulnerable Arab Sheikhdom to the south. Had he any
          alternative (?) - perhaps not! In order to keep himself in power he
          had to undertake another miscalculated adventurism, otherwise
          disgruntled people of Iraq would topple him, he feared!</p>

          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">These demands and allegations
          of provocative nature against gulf kingdoms and open military
          preparations near the Kuwaiti border made by the Iraqi government
          created anxiety &amp; concern, if not panic, among the Arab states.
          Egyptian President Hosne Mubarak immediately brought Iraq and Kuwait
          to negotiation table in Saudi Arabia, hoping to diffuse the tense
          situation without the intervention of any outside power including USA.
          But Saddam showed little interest in a negotiated settlement and
          finally broke it off as he on the very next day, August 2, 1900,
          ordered his army to march into Kuwait. Hussein made some mistakes in
          his calculations in this brave posture:</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>

          </span></span>Firstly, he assumed that his fellow Arab countries would
          be forced to accept ?occupation and despoliation of Kuwait? as fait
          accompli.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in" align="justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">
          </span></span>Secondly, even if the Arabs did not approve of his
          seizure over Kuwait, they would not call upon outside powers
          particularly Western powers. But he misjudged. Instead, the government
          of Kuwait who fled to Saudi Arabia, and the panicky Saudi king Fahd
          send SOS at once to Washington and United Nations for help. The
          superpowers including USA, British and Soviet governments condemned
          the Iraqi action as aggression. The UN Security Council immediately
          demanded the Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait soil.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list .5in" align="justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol">·<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">
          </span></span>Thirdly Iraq did not anticipated that its unilateral
          action will bring in universal condemnation and deplore. USA went a
          step further when its president Bush (Senior) invoked Carter doctrine
          by declaring that the integrity of Saudi Arabia, now exposed to Iraqi
          invasion, was a vital American interest. Even in Arab league,
          two-thirds of the 21 members likewise condemned Iraq?s aggression.
          Within days the United States, the European Community, the Soviet
          Union, and Japan all imposed an embargo on Iraq. After only a few days
          on 6<sup>th</sup> August, 1990, the <u><span style="COLOR: green">Security
          Council voted for strict economic sanctions on Iraq</span></u> (with
          only Cuba and Yemen abstaining), - this was beyond the apprehension of
          Iraq.</p>

          </span></span>Fourthly, Saddam Hussein could not foresee that USA and
          other super powers (UK &amp; France) would militarily intervene in
          favour of Kuwait nor he could imagine that Security Council would not
          only call for unconditional withdrawal of forces from Kuwait, but also
          invoke series of economic sanctions against Iraq. In fact Iraq became
          totally isolated. This had never been so in the history of Iraq.</p>

          </span></span>Fifthly, Saddam in the light of USA?s miserable
          experience in Vietnam War and the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-80
          during Jim Carter?s tenure misjudged that the USA to be willing and
          able to take up a serious challenge in Asia, even one mounted by a
          third world country. He did not realize the technological advancement
          in modern warfare took place since Vietnam War. In theses days of
          warfare air and pinpointed guided missiles play a leading role, the
          infantry and armored units came only in final assault.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In fact on the same day
          Security Council endorsed economic sanctions, the Saudi King appealed
          for American military protection for his country to which President
          Bush (Senior) reacted positively by invoking what he called ?Operation
          Desert Shield? aimed to stop further Iraqi drive towards Saudi
          kingdom. He immediately deployed 200,000 troops to the northern
          deserts of Saudi Arabia, later on augmented by British and French
          units with naval and air supports. The operation desert shield had
          limited purpose- (1) to deter Iraq from attacking Saudi Arabia, (2)
          seizing control of one third of the world's oil reserves. Later on
          Egypt and 12 other Arab League nations joined the apart from Saudi
          Arabia and Kuwait itself, US led coalition force. Hussein answered
          this gesture of his Arab colleagues calling them traitors of Arab
          cause and declared Jihad against the coalition force, forgetting that
          Iraqi regime under Saddam only provided lip service to the Muslim
          cause including that of Palestine.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Irresistible Saddam however
          responded to international pressure by formally annexing Kuwait as
          Iraq?s 19<sup>th</sup> province on 8<sup>th</sup> August, 1990, an act
          Security Council instantly condemned and detaining all foreigners
          caught in Kuwait and Iraq as hostages.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">This is the first time since
          the days of cold war between the West and Soviet Union the US and
          Soviet Union saw an international problem from the same view point
          despite the fact that Soviets had some soft corner for Saddam
          government. As for UNO, Iraq-Kuwait conflict appears to be a test of
          the world body as a genuine force for peace, and thus Soviet-Western
          cooperation. USA, in the voice of its president, opined the Persian
          Gulf crisis as a test case for the ?new world order?. As the crisis
          was deepening the coalition force countries managed to swing the world
          opinion in their favour and succeeded presenting a united front
          against Iraq. A large contingent of American troops based in Germany
          was transferred to Saudi Arabia available for operation desert shield.
          This is a clear indication on the part of the US government that
          Russian Red Army no longer present a danger in Europe. Only a handful
          of neighbouring countries like Jordan, Algeria, Sudan, Tunisia, Yemen,
          and the PLO gave some support to Iraq urging coalition front not
          intervene militarily. As it seemed Saddam would not withdraw its
          troops from Kuwait in spite of UN?s repeated call, finally the
          Security Council on 25<sup>th</sup> August resolved permitting allied
          ships in the Persian Gulf to use force to enforce the embargo against
          Iraq. But as Saddam remained unmoved Bush (senior) and Gorbachev met
          in Helsinki on 9<sup>th</sup> September issuing a joint declaration
          calling for Iraq to withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait. Earlier Bush
          declared, ?the annexation of Kuwait will not stand?.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
          </span>Saddam Hussein, possibly thinking that united front and UN
          meant business, he showed some leniency by releasing foreign hostages
          detained in Kuwait. This act prompted France and Russia to begin a
          dialogue with the autocratic regime and hectic diplomatic efforts from
          October 1990 to January 1991 continued to find a diplomatic solution
          in order to avoid a head-on outbreak of armed hostilities. But
          diplomatic efforts failed. Saddam however hinted that his troops might
          withdraw if Ar-Rumaylah oil fields remained under the possession of
          Iraq. USA and other members of the front rejected Iraqi demand urging
          once again Iraq to unconditional withdrawal as per UN resolution. The
          Security Council in the meanwhile stiffened its attitude adopting a
          resolution holding Iraq liable for reparations for all damage caused
          in Kuwait by its invasion and seizure. Bush, in November doubled the
          size of the ?Desert Shield? forces from 200,000 to 400, 000 soldiers,
          sailors, airmen and marines so that the allied force, if needed, would
          have ?an adequate offensive military option?. Saddam reacted to this
          act of united front by reinforcing his own occupation forces to
          680,000.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In the meanwhile a serious
          dilemma was popping in the world opinion and many questions being
          asked :</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Firstly, would or could
          ultimately America or the united front intervene militarily to
          liberate Kuwait ?-- or they would prefer to use UN pressure on Iraq by
          adopting multiple UN resolutions as bargaining chips - - sacrificing
          some in return for Iraq to withdraw from the soil of Kuwait.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Secondly, many started thinking
          would mere withdrawal of Iraqi forces suffice to pacify the region.
          They were questioning Saddam?s genuineness for keeping peace in the
          sensitive area. He had proved in the past that to him an aggressive
          war is an effective tool of his state policy.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Thirdly, over the last 10 years
          following his futile invasion of Iran the regime of Saddam Hussein
          spent his oil revenues to equip his military units with most
          sophisticated weapons including chemical-biological agents and nuclear
          weapons facilities that could produce warheads. With the active
          cooperation of Soviet Union and even USA, he had built up a huge army.
          Thinking continued that mere withdrawal of Iraqis would not bring in
          genuine security and peace in the middle east, especially in the Gulf
          region if destruction of the offensive capability and perhaps removal
          of autocratic regime of Hussein from the seat of power were not
          carried out. This was a sincere and genuine concern for many
          middle-east analysts, many of whom opined that such goals were
          achievable only through war.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The USA however repeated its
          insistence that no reward of occupation in any form be admitted to
          Iraq except unconditional withdrawal. Finally on 29<sup>th</sup>
          November, President Bush and the USA received authorization from the
          Security Council to use all means including force necessary in the
          gulf if Iraq failed to comply with all UN resolutions by 15th January,
          1991. This is a unique victory on the part of USA and its president.
          US senate finally voted 52-47, and the house 250-183, to authorize the
          President to use force in gulf crisis. Emboldened with these
          authorizations Bush declared that it was not his responsibility to
          provide the Iraqi President with a way out and that he would not
          permit the autocratic dictator to appear, in the eyes of the Arabs, as
          a hero who had stood up to the American imperialists. Considering the
          mood of the congress and the senate members, my thinking is that Iraq
          could have, probably, tied Bush?s hands just by making some
          conciliatory gestures. Instead Iraqi leader remained defiant and
          played into Bush?s trap. He refused to respond constructively to
          Soviet-France, appear to be genuine well-wishers of the Iraqi people
          trying best to avoid the horror of war, overtures, remained defiant
          and repeated his useless &amp; fruitless rhetoric.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The result of US-Iraq war was a
          total isolation of Iraq from the rest of the world comity of nations
          not only in Western world but also even in the countries of Islamic
          Umma. Even the then Bangladesh government of Khaleda Begum decided to
          part with Iraq, although her fundamentalist supporters led by Maulana
          Mannan, a prominent rajakar of 1971-war, flooded the streets of Dhaka
          with processions, and rallies with full throated war cry (Jihad) in
          favor of Saddam. The ceasefire followed series of UN sponsored
          sanctions those over the years crippled Iraq economically as well as
          militarily. It became truly a weak country in every respect except in
          the rhetoric empty outbursts of Saddam Hussein and his autocratic
          regime. Two gulf wars did not teach them lesson to behave themselves
          and come to terms with the disgruntled Shia majorities in the south
          &amp; central Iraq and with nationalist Kurdish minorities in the
          north. Instead President Saddam continued his repressive and
          tyrannical measures against them with more vigour and ferocity
          tantamount to genocide.</p>

          Desert Shield had been converted to ?<span style="COLOR: red">Operation
          Desert Storm</span>? and that the liberation of Kuwait had began. He
          termed it not as war against Iraq but a counter offensive, as war had

          aggressor.</p>

          hundreds of US bombers, augmented by French, UK, Saudi and Kuwaiti war
          planes and US Navy cruise missiles, started pounding day after day

          Iraq and Kuwait, on Iraqi command and control centres, nuclear,
          chemical, and biological weapons plants, conventional weapons
          establishments, electrical power establishments, bridges-dams, and all

          Needless to say the liberation Kuwait brought untold sufferings to
          innocent Iraqi civilians for no fault of their own. If any person had

          response to this unmatched offensive of utmost technological
          supremacy, was his rhetoric-hollow wards coupled with issuing threats
          of terror weapons of mass destruction including forbidden weapons of
          warfare. He declared jihad against the infidel USA and call upon the
          Muslim Umma to unite against the satanic enemy, the united front
          countries. He warned the allied forces that in this ?mother of all
          battles?, they would be drowned in ?pools of their own blood.? In
          order to divert the attention and bring out division among the Arab
          countries he fired at least 39 Scud surface-surface missiles targeting
          Tel Aviv and Jerusalem- most falling harmlessly causing no severe
          damage. Later on most of the projectiles were neutralized in the sky
          by the American Patriot antimissile missiles. But Saddam?s objective
          for hoping Israeli retaliation, was not achieved as Israel, at the
          advice of the USA remained cool and maintained remarkable reticence,
          though was understandably furious. The Arab-West coalition hung
          together with much displeasure of Saddam.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">From the very begining of war
          it was apparent to any sensible &amp; logical war analysts that Iraq
          could meet this challenge with little or no meaningful resistance.
          Within a day its air defense system was completely eliminated and its
          warplanes took shelter in the neighbouring country Iran, a traditional
          enemy country, but now neutral. In a desperate attempt Iraq authority
          opened Kuwait oil pipelines into the see creating a vast &amp; wide
          spread oil slick in hopes of clogging Saudi fresh-water plants and
          causing severe environmental pollution in the sea costs. Saddam
          thought the extent of environmental pollution as a consequence of war
          would create world opinion against the allied force.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It appeared to me at that time
          that only way left to Saddam to win the war to draw the allied force
          in a face to face confrontation on the ground and entrap them there
          inflicting casualties as heavy as possible that would turn the
          American public opinion against their president urging him to stop
          war, the opinion most elected leader fear. The final ground onslaught
          began just after the dead line of 23<sup>rd</sup> February;
          Saudi-Kuwait ground force moved toward Kuwait city along the coast of
          Persian gulf, S marine forces broke through Kuwait-Iraq border in the
          north; the main thrust came from far behind on desert where
          US-Anglo-French armored columns swept around the flank of the Iraqi
          army and turned eastward through southern Iraq towards the city of
          Basra. The Iraqi unit in Kuwait was thus trapped in. The republican
          guards near Kuwait-Iraq border were completely extinguished by the
          allied tanks and air force. Within three days Iraq?s main massive army
          eased to exist surrendering more than 100,000 and over tens of
          thousands more were fleeing homeward. The allied force achieved what
          they wanted and President Bush declared a ceasefire just 100 hours
          after the ground offensive had begun. The Iraqi government conceded
          defeat by announcing its acceptance to abide by all twelve UN
          resolutions. The war came to an end, at least temporarily.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In retrospect, USA might be
          thinking that in making what Saddam was during the second gulf war its
          contribution was no less. Throughout 1980 US policy had been to assist
          Iraq in its war against Iran and permitted export of not only
          conventional and sophisticated weapons but also strategic materials to
          Saddam despite his dictatorial ambition.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">USA, more particularly its
          President, the senior Bush what failed to achieve was unseating Saddam
          from power. It is now alleged that on the advice of General Collin
          Powel, chairman of the US joint Chefs of Staff, Bush decided not to
          press on to Baghdad or to destroy all Iraq?s Republican Guards units,
          obviously not to create power vacuum in the region keeping Iran in
          mind. Undaunted Saddam took advantage of the ceasefire to focus his
          activities in the internal affairs. He proceeded to crush rebellious
          Kurds in the north and Shiite dissidents in the south with ruthless
          ferocity. Initially US response was of restrain because of interests
          of Turkey, which also did the same thing to check Kurdish movement
          within its territory. So far suppression of Shiite Moslems in the
          south, president was perhaps restrained by the fear that Iran?s Mullah
          regime might try to expand its Islamic revolution in Iraq. Iran-phobia
          was always an important element in the Middle East policy of USA. When
          however Saddam?s actions were becoming menace to the US interest, it
          enforced no-fly zones to stop Iraqi attacks on civilians. This brought
          in long drawn Fly-Zone War which ultimately culminated into Operation
          Desert Fox in 1998. One thing is however clear that American policy
          clearly meant to uphold Iraqi unity so as to preserve the regional
          balance of power.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Fly Zone War is in fact the
          legacy of inconclusive Operation Desert Storm, which was not carried
          to its final goal i.e. total defeat of Saddam. The US administration
          on the one hand had kept subdued Saddam in power with his reduced
          status in the eye of Arabs, on the other hand it wanted to keep unity
          of Iraq as a possible threat to both Iran and Turkey too. The US
          policy was to maintain balance of power in the region. They want to
          keep Kurdish people in northern region under restrain from total
          break-way from Iraq in order to keep Turkey in good humour, on the
          other hand US want to keep Shia rebellion under control to put a check
          on the Iranians to use this Shiite Movement to be exploited by the
          Mullah regime of Iran. This they thought would be achievable if Saddam
          is kept in power under US control &amp; supervision. The double-faced
          diplomacy of US administration was the root of continued US Iraqi
          conflict since the ceasefire and deepening the present crisis that
          finally led to third Persian Gulf War. Learning from the past, this
          time Junior Bush did not stop till the occupation of Baghdad
          synonymous to elimination of Saddam regime.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Since the ceasefire there was a
          lull only for a brief period, but tension and conflict between US led
          coalition force (USA, UK, and France) flared up time to time until it
          took serious turn when the coalition force was bound to go for intense
          ?Desert Fox? bombing campaign in 1998. The roots of the continued
          conflicts between the Iraqi authorities and the coalition force,
          according to the political analysts, is hidden in the vague and
          inconclusive ceasefire agreement ending the second Gulf war (1990-91).
          The agreement called upon the Iraqi government to allow United Nations
          weapons inspectors to search for prohibited weapons in Iraq (<u>Resolution
          687 ? August April 3, 1991</u>), and more importantly to create two
          ?No-Fly-Zones?, one in the northern, another in the southern Iraq. The
          original intent of these zones was to protect rebellious Kurds in the
          north and Shia Moslems in the south. This gave allied force to fly
          warplanes over these regions to prevent Iraqi government from using
          military aircraft to attack the Kurds and the Shiite Moslems. But soon
          the allied forces frequently began using the zones as a means to force
          Iraq obeying UN resolutions and coalition demands, more particularly
          related to UN inspectors for Weapons Of Mass Destruction (WOMD). As
          the tension between US government and that of Iraq was escalating,
          following September 11 Event (2001) US administration openly expressed
          its two concerns over Iraq.</p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Firstly, Iraq was not complying
          with UN resolutions, and not honouring 1991 ceasefire agreement as the
          Iraqi authority no longer allowing UN weapons inspectors to look for
          WOMD since 1998 when it barred the UN inspectors from Iraq. This
          action of Iraq prompted US-UK air strikes (the Operation Desert Fox).
          Bush (junior) was, with not much material proof, convinced, nay
          obsessed with idea that Saddam is fabricating WOMDs and would be used
          against USA, and America?s allies in the Middle East including Israel
          and Saudi Arabia in any future war in the region. Secondly, Bush
          administration is afraid off Iraqi support for international
          terrorism, a phobia USA is suffering from since September 11. Bush
          (junior) administration was convinced that September 11 assault on
          twin towers had, if not direct, but indirect support of Saddam regime
          and its involvement. This allegation however until now found baseless,
          so also alleged Iraqi government?s link with terrorist groups of Bin
          Laden. But in any case these two concerns of America were being
          constantly used to prepare a ground for all out war against Iraq.</p>

          periodically this ?cold war? erupts into open warfare, as the Iraqi
          authority defies the UN and US prompting military responses. Over the
          years a series of operations under different name such as operation
          southern watch (August 2, 1992 ? January 13, 1993, operation desert
          strike (September 3 &amp; 4, 1996) and operation desert fox (December
          16 ? 20, 1998), the last one being the most important and most
          effective, were conducted by the allied forces. There were also
          nameless series of operation conducted by the coalition from January
          17 ? June 27, 1993 and again in the period from December 29 &amp; 30,
          1998 to beginning of 3<sup>rd</sup> Persian Gulf.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The main cases of this
          continued conflicts between the coalition &amp; UN on the one hand and
          Iraqi government on the other hand is the mutual disbelief and pointed
          allegations against each other. Disagreement also exits in the view
          point- over the extent and need for continued UN inspections. UN and
          the Coalition alleged that Iraq is not living up to the terms of the
          agreement and are still engaged developing WOMDs, which Iraq flatly
          and emphatically denies. Iraq further complains that the US backed
          coalition is violating its sovereignty and through severe economic
          sanction crippling its economy. On many occasion Saddam regime
          attempted to evict the UN inspectors from Iraq to which coalition,
          backed by UN, responded with threats and occasional bomb and missile
          onslaught. Another point of irritation on the part of the Iraqi
          government was the continuation of the no-fly-zones for indefinite
          period. Originally carved out two geographical zones one in the north
          and another in the south to protect the rebellious Kurds in north and
          oppressed Shiites in the south were forbidden zone in which Iraqi
          aircrafts were not allowed to fly. The coalition force time to time
          enforced these zones by shooting down Iraqi plane and attacking Iraqi
          air defence missile batteries on the ground.</p>

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The situation became very
          tensed as in December 1998, the Saddam government evicted the United
          Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspectors, the organization that
          conducts the weapons inspection in Iraq, accusing them of spying for
          the CIA, not very much unlikely too. As a retaliation measure, the
          coalition force unleashed ?Operation Desert Fox (December 16 ? 20,
          1998) on Iraq. The allied forces? warplanes and cruise missiles bombed
          on Iraqi targets for five days. The coalition force attacked suspected<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
          </span>production-sites of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons,
          and hit targets of airfield, military command centres, missile

          <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">President Saddam responded by
          declaring that Iraq no more recognized no-fly-zones, and would
          actively contest the coalition for control of all Iraqi airspace.
          Saddam further declared formal end to all UNSCOM inspections. This
          resulted almost continued armed conflicts in the skies over Iraq as
          air-defence missiles batteries attempt to shoot down American and
          British warplanes to which the Allied forces provided befitting answer
          by neutralizing those missiles and striking Iraqi targets of their
          choice with fierce intensity. According to New York Times in an
          article (August 13, 1999) the coalition force had intensified
          continued attack on Iraqi targets. Sine the beginning of 1999 over 8
          months the allied force sent 1,100 missiles on 359 Iraqi targets. By
          all accounts, Iraqi forces continued to target their radar and fired
          missiles at allied warplanes. It was only a matter of time then that a

          Iraqi Freedom?, which was switched on 19<sup>th</sup> March, 2003</p>

          </span></span>The post ceasefire fly-zone-war conflict created
          continued tension in the Gulf region thus causing disrupting the
          worldwide oil markets. In historical terms, no-fly-zone war may be
          considered to have ended on 19<sup>th</sup> March, 2003 when
          ?Operation Iraqi Freedom? began and this conflict converted itself
          into the larger war. All three of coalition wars with Iraq the Gulf
          war (1990-91), No-Fly-Zone War (1991-2003(), and the Gulf war (2003)
          are really one single long drawn war.</p>

          </span></span>The enforcing of no-fly-zones was causing continued
          drain on the military resources of USA and other allied partners
          including UK and France. Increasing criticism building up among the
          common Arabs of the Gulf Sheikhs and Saudi monarchs who were allowing
          their soils to be used by the allied force.</p>

          </span></span>The most sufferers were however Iraqi common people. The
          nation?s infrastructure totally collapsed and thousands of children
          died as the poorer elements of the society were hit by the UN embargo.</p>
