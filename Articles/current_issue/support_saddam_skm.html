          almost a mystery how people's sentiment works. Especially, I do not
          quite fathom how and why almost 99.9999% Muslims today wholeheartedly
          support Iraqi president Saddam Hossain. Widespread war protests have
          erupted throughout the Muslim world on daily basis. Is it for the sake
          of peace, or is it because they are saddened by the loss of human
          lives in war? Is it because they are exercising their ardent force of
          humanity, or is it because they are simply motivated by Islamo-mania?
          Which one is correct? Let me examine this case in point:</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify"><b>Who
          is Saddam Hossain?</b></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Saddam
          Hossain is known as the most brutal, despotic tyrannical dictator of
          the century. There is no match or no parallel for him if we compare
          all the qualities of Saddam Hossain with any other despotic dictor.
          This diabolic dictator killed over two millions Muslims (Sunni,
          Shiites and Kurdish together) during his 24 years of despotic rule. He
          gassed tens of thousands of his own peoples (Kurdish muslims),
          killed/assassinated hundreds of thousands of his own muslim brothers,
          tortured/maimed/imprisoned tens of thousands of his own people. He
          even killed or imprisoned many of his own relatives. And he drove
          500,000 thousands of his own citizens out of the country. Just other
          day a CNN reporter was interviewing one such Iraqi dissident (can not
          remember name, but he was a high level officer under Saddam's Govt.).
          Reporter asked him if he was worried about many co-lateral
          damage/killings of civilian in Iraq during US intense bombing (daisy
          cutters). This Iraqi replied: <b><span style="color: red">'</span><span style="COLOR: red">Saddam

          during his 23 years of dictatorial rule.</span></b> <b><span style="COLOR: red">Why
          should I be worried for a few thousands of collateral loss of lives to
          free Iraqi people from the cruel hands of Saddam'?</span></b></p>

          plundered oil-wealth of Iraq only to become one of the richest man
          (Owned $7 Billions fortune in foreign banks) on earth, built more than
          45 luxurious Kingly Palaces leaving 60% of his own citizen unfed or
          poorly fed. He gathered most of the lethal weapons of mass destruction
          and he poisoned his own people in a thousands. Invaded and occupied
          his Muslim brotherly country Kuwait and fought a terrible war lasting
          more than eight years with his Muslim neighbor Iran killing millions
          of Muslims. <b>Yet Muslims</b> <b>got to support Saddam Hossain.</b></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Why?
          Simply because Saddam is a born Muslim and his country is a Muslim
          populated country. It really does not matter that Saddam is a devilish
          human being, does not matter Saddam never helped any Muslim or
          non-Muslim country with humanitarian aid (<i>By the way, America and
          Britain are the greatest champions of humanitarian help throughout the</i>
          <i>whole world irrespective religion, race or creed</i>), but it is
          most important religious duty for every Muslim to support another
          Muslim. It is the most holy teaching of Islam to support and love
          fellow Muslim and it is the rule of thumb in Islamic doctrine. THIS IS
          KNOWN AS URGENT DUTY OF IALAMIC UMMA. I call it 'umma-bazi', or <b>syndrome
          of Islamic Brotherhood</b>. The ethics and equal justice applies only
          for fellow Muslims and not for non-Muslims or any infidels.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Interestingly,
          Muslims of course can fight another Muslims and in that case, Muslims
          can choose their respective friends whom to support, but when comes
          the conflict between a Muslim vs. non-Muslim-every Muslim should
          blindly support Muslim only. This is the ardent duty of Islamic
          Ummabazi (Islamic Brotherhood). Remember first Gulp war in 1991? Saudi
          Clerics were protesting the involvement of America and other western
          infidels to rescue Kuwaiti Muslims with pure Quranic fatwas. They did
          not like that an infidel country do the job of removing Iraqi
          occupation of another Muslim country. Also please try to refresh your
          memory and recapitulate what happened during our liberation war in
          1971. Entire Muslim world blindly and ardently supported Pakistan
          marauding soldiers to kill and rape Bangalee infidels (Hindus) and <u>not
          so good Bangalee Muslims</u>. Even our own Bengali Mullahs/Maulanas/Madrasha
          students (Razakars and Al-Badars) and pukka Muslims did support
          Pakistani invaders and fought in favor of Pakistan <b><u>only to save
          Islam</u></b>, read Pakistan.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">You
          should not be surprised for that at all! Because to all Arab Muslims
          Bangalees were not good Muslims at all. But I can bet million dollars
          that if, '71 war of liberation was between Bangalees and Indian
          government-entire Muslim world would have definitely supported
          Bangalees in their struggle. <b><span style="COLOR: red">Does this

          Muslim but unjust</span></b> <b><span style="COLOR: red">king was the
          superior to the un-believing just king'</span></b>. Because, in Islam
          a Muslim is always superior to any non-muslim/infidels. In the above
          historical quote what we have learned is that, non-Muslim ruler can
          never be the best ruler than a despotic Muslim ruler. Besides this
          above historical account, there are many sahi hadiths and Quranic
          dictum which suggest the Islamic principal of supporting <u>Muslim
          only</u> if the conflict is with non-Muslim. Remember mother Teresa-an
          angelic woman? She will not go to heaven and no Muslim should praise
          her for her extra-ordinary humanity either, because she was not a
          Muslim. That was what we heard from most erudite Islamists.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Do
          you know this? If the Iraq was not a Muslim country, or tomorrow world
          hears that Saddam and his countrymen have converted to other religion
          (Christian, Hindu or Buddhism) all the people of Muslim world will be
          totally silent and will go with their normal business. Or, if this war
          of America-Brit was against North Korean despotic communist ruler, no
          Muslim country would ever demonstrate any street show like the one we
          are encountering today. <b>I can bet my bottom dollars on this
          assertion of mine</b>. Don't believe me? Here are some tips for
          you:&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Just
          3-4 years ago NATO-Pact countries viciously attacked Serbian
          Yugoslavian nation of Dictator Slobodan Miloslave (another despotic
          leader) only to save a endangered Muslim-European nation Bosnia.
          Entire Muslim world was deadly silent; rather Muslims were happy that
          Christian nations were whipping another Christian nation (to save a
          Muslim nation) with relentless bombings and untold destructions. No, I
          have not heard any Muslim to tell that they were so sorry that NATO
          bombings are killing innocent women and children in a Catholic nation
          of Europe! Picture among the Muslim countries would have been quite
          different if Miloslave was a Muslim ruler like Saddam. We have not
          seen any such sympathy-demonstration after the dastardly incident of
          9/11 in any Muslim country. Rather we have seen many joyous cheerful
          dances in the Arab streets for the success of al-Qaeda Islamic
          terrorists.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify"><b>War
          for oil: (?)</b></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Most
          frequent claims by Muslims are: (1) America attacked Iraq to grab
          Iraqi oil; (2) this war is against Islam, (3) America and the west
          want to destroy Islam. When Afghanistan was attacked-they told us that
          American infidels want to destroy Islam in Afghanistan and want to
          convert Afghan people to Christianity. Other day one friend of mine
          was telling me that America will destroy Islam in Iraq and they will
          convert entire Iraqi people into Christianity. Some even claim that
          America will occupy entire Arab to grab their oil and to destroy
          Islam. Remember first Gulp war in 1991? During first Gulp war to
          liberate Kuwait, many Muslims erudite told us that America is going to
          occupy Arab oils (with this excuse of ?Kuwaiti liberation war?) and to
          destroy Islam.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align="justify">Fact
          of the matter is, Afghan was liberated from those mad Taliban's and
          Islam still exists in Afghanistan. Afghan peoples are much happier
          than before. Islam still remains and flourishing in Arab peninsula and
          America did not occupy Arab oils. So what? Muslims will still cry for
          Saddam and cry for Islam. Surprisingly, Christian west never cry for
          any Christian, they never cry by saying 'Christianity is in danger or
          Christianity will be destroyed'. In fact west never bring their
          religious identity at the fore for any matter. They never go to the
          street when an innocent Christian-born human being is slaughtered by
          Muslims, or a Christian Church is bombed by Islamic terrorists in
          Pakistan. Only Allah knows when Muslim will be human again!</p>
