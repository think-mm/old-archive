  haunts </span>the world, and that specter is America. This is not the America
  discoverable in the pages of a world atlas, but a mythical America that is the
  target of the new form of anti-Americanism that Salman Rushdie, writing in the<i>
  Guardian</i> (February <span class="caps">6, 2002</span>), says “is
  presently taking the world by storm” and that forms the subject of a <i>Washington
  Post</i> essay by Martin Kettle significantly entitled “U.S. Bashing: It’s
  All The Rage In Europe” (January <span class="caps">7, 2002</span>). It is
  an America that Anatol Lieven assures us, in a recent article in the <i>London
  Review of Books</i>, is nothing less than “a menace to itself and to
  mankind” and that Noam Chomsky has repeatedly characterized as the world’s
  major terrorist state.</p>
  <p>But above all it is the America that is responsible for the evils of the
  rest of the world. As Dario Fo, the winner of the <span class="caps">1997</span>
  Nobel Prize for literature, put it in a notorious post-September <span class="caps">11</span>
  email subsequently quoted in the <i>New York Times</i> (September <span class="caps">22,
  2001</span>): “The great speculators [of American capitalism] wallow in an
  economy that every years kills tens of millions of people with poverty [in the
  Third World] — so what is <span class="caps">20,000</span> dead in New York?
  Regardless of who carried out the massacre [of <span class="caps">9-11</span>],
  this violence is the legitimate daughter of the culture of violence, hunger
  and inhumane exploitation.”</p>
  <p>It is this sort of America that is at the hub of Antonio Negri and Michael
  Hardt’s revision of Marxism in their intellectually influential book <i>Empire
  </i>(Harvard University Press, <span class="caps">2000</span>) — a
  reinterpretation of historical materialism in which the global capitalist
  system will be overthrown not by those who have helped to create it, namely,
  the working class, but rather by a polyglot global social force vaguely
  referred to as “the multitude” — the alleged victims of this system.</p>
  <p>America-bashing is anti-Americanism at its most radical and totalizing. Its
  goal is not to advise, but to condemn; not to fix, but to destroy. It
  repudiates every thought of reform in any normal sense; it sees no difference
  between American liberals and American conservatives; it views every American
  action, both present and past, as an act of deliberate oppression and systemic
  exploitation. It is not that America went wrong here or there; it is that it
  is wrong root and branch. The conviction at the heart of those who engage in
  it is really quite simple: that America is an unmitigated evil, an
  irredeemable enormity.</p>
  <p>This is the specter that is haunting the world today. Indeed, one may even
  go so far as to argue that this America is the fundamental organizing
  principle of the left as it exists today: To be against America is to be on
  the right side of history; to be for it is to be on the wrong side.</p>
  <p>But let’s pause to ask a question whose answer the America-bashers appear
  to assume they know: What <i>is</i> the right side of history at this point in
  history?</p>
  <p>The concept of a right side of history is derived from Marxism, and it is
  founded on the belief that there is a forward advance toward a socialist
  future that can be resisted, but not ultimately defeated. But does anyone
  believe this anymore? Does anyone take seriously the claim that the present
  state of affairs will be set aside and a wholly new order of things
  implemented in its place, and that such a transformation of the world will
  happen <i>as a matter of course</i>?</p>
  <p>And, finally, if in fact there are those who believe such a thing, what is
  the status of this belief? Is it a realistic assessment of the objective
  conditions of the present world order, or is it merely wishful thinking?</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Marx’s
  political realism</span></font></p>
  <p><img alt src="T.GIF" align="left" border="0" width="70" height="55"><span class="caps">he
  importance of</span> these questions should be obvious to anyone familiar with
  the thought of Marx. Marx’s uniqueness as a thinker of the left is his
  absolute commitment to the principles of <i>political realism</i>. This is the
  view that any political energy that is put into what is clearly a hopeless
  cause is a waste. Utopianism is not only impractical; it is an obstacle to
  obtaining socialism’s true objective, since it diverts badly needed
  resources away from the pursuit of viable goals, wasting them instead on the
  pursuit of political fantasies.</p>
  <p>The concept of fantasy as a political category assumed its central place in
  Marxist thought in <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, where Karl Marx and
  Friedrich Engels used it as the distinguishing mark of their own brand of
  socialism: It was this that condemned all previous forms of socialism to the
  realm of vague dreams and good intentions, and which gave Marxism the claim to
  be a “scientific” form of socialism.</p>
  <p>Marx’s use of the term “scientific” in this text has often been
  criticized. But, in his defense, it should be remembered that the German <i>Wissenschaft</i>
  describes a far wider category than the English “science.” It means what
  we know as opposed to what we merely opine, or feel, or imagine; the objective
  as opposed to the subjective; realistic thinking as opposed to impractical
  daydreaming. And it is in this last sense that Marx and Engels use it: For the
  opposite of the scientific is none other than the utopian.</p>
  <p>This is the basis of Marx’s condemnation of all forms of <i>utopian
  socialism</i>, the essence of which is the enormous gap between the
  “fantastic pictures of future society” the utopian socialist dreams of
  achieving, on one hand, and any realistic assessment of the objective
  conditions of the actual social order on the other.</p>
  <p>This concept of fantasy as “fantastic pictures” inside the head of
  impractical daydreamers is a classic theme of German Romantic literature and
  is perhaps most closely identified with the characters of E.T.A. Hoffman’s
  stories, such as Kapellmeister Kreisler. The fantasist, in this literature, is
  a character type: He lives in his own dream world and can manage only the most
  tenuous relationship to the real world around him. But, unlike the character
  type of the absent-minded professor, the Romantic fantasist is not content to
  putter around in his own world. Instead, he is forever insisting that his
  world is the real one, and in the process of doing this, he reduces the real
  world around him, and the people in it, to an elaborate stage setting for the
  enactment of his own private fantasies.</p>
  <p>Marx and Engels’s wholesale condemnation of all previous socialism as
  utopian fantasy is <i>the</i> fundamental innovation of their own work. It is
  the basis of their claim to be taken seriously, not merely by Hoffmanesque
  daydreamers, but by men of practical judgment and shrewd common sense. To fail
  to make this distinction, or to fail to stay on the right side of this
  distinction once it has been made, is to cease to be a Marxist and to fall
  back into mere <i>Träumerei</i>.</p>
  <p>This demarcation line arose because Marx believed that he had grasped
  something that no previous utopian socialist had even suspected. He believed
  that he had shown that socialism was inevitable and that it would come about
  through certain ironclad laws of history — laws that Marx believed were
  revealed through the study of the very nature of capitalism. Socialism, in
  short, would not come about because a handful of daydreamers had wished for
  it, or because pious moralists had urged it, but because the unavoidable
  breakdown of the capitalist system would force the turn to socialism upon
  those societies that, prior to this breakdown, had been organized along
  capitalist lines.</p>
  <p>Schematically the scenario went something like this:</p>
  <p>• The capitalists would begin to suffer from a falling rate of profit.</p>
  <p>• The workers would therefore be “immiserized”; they would become
  poorer as the capitalists struggled to keep their own heads above water.</p>
  <p>• The poverty of the workers would drive them to overthrow the capitalist
  system — their poverty, not their ideals.</p>
  <p>What is interesting here is that, once you accept the initial premise about
  the falling rate of profit, the rest does indeed follow <i>realistically</i>.
  Now, this does not mean that it follows necessarily or according to an
  ironclad scientific law; but it certainly conveys what any reasonable person
  would take as the most probable outcome of a hypothetical failure of
  capitalism.</p>
  <p>For Marx it is absolutely essential that revolutionary activities be
  justifiable on realistic premises. If they cannot be, then they are actions
  that cannot possibly have a real political objective — and therefore, their
  only value can be the private emotional or spiritual satisfaction of the
  people carrying out this pseudo-political action.</p>
  <p>So in order for revolutionary activity to have a chance of succeeding,
  there is an unavoidable precondition: The workers must have become much poorer
  over time. Furthermore, there had to be not merely an increase of poverty, but
  a conviction on the part of the workers that their material circumstances
  would only get worse, and not better — and this would require genuine
  misery.</p>
  <p>This is the immiserization thesis of Marx. And it is central to
  revolutionary Marxism, since if capitalism produces no widespread misery, then
  it also produces no fatal internal contradiction: If everyone is getting
  better off through capitalism, who will dream of struggling to overthrow it?
  Only genuine misery on the part of the workers would be sufficient to overturn
  the whole apparatus of the capitalist state, simply because, as Marx insisted,
  the capitalist class could not be realistically expected to relinquish control
  of the state apparatus and, with it, the monopoly of force. In this, Marx was
  absolutely correct. No capitalist society has ever willingly liquidated
  itself, and it is utopian to think that any ever will. Therefore, in order to
  achieve the goal of socialism, nothing short of a complete revolution would
  do; and this means, in point of fact, a full-fledged civil war not just within
  one society, but across the globe. Without this catastrophic upheaval,
  capitalism would remain completely in control of the social order and all
  socialist schemes would be reduced to pipe dreams.</p>
  <p>The immiserization thesis, therefore, is critical to Marx, for without it
  there would be no objective conditions in response to which workers might be
  driven to overthrow the capitalist system. If the workers were becoming better
  off with time, then why jump into an utterly untested and highly speculative
  economic scheme? Especially when even socialists themselves were bitterly
  divided over what such a scheme would be like in actual practice. Indeed, Marx
  never committed himself to offering a single suggestion about how socialism
  would actually function in the real world.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Immiserization
  goes global</span></font></p>
  <p><img alt src="B.GIF" align="left" border="0" width="57" height="58"><span class="caps">y the
  twentieth century</span> the immiserization thesis was already beginning to
  look shaky. Empirical evidence, drawn either by impressionistic observation or
  systematic statistical studies, began to suggest that there was something
  wrong with the classical version of the thesis, and an attempt was made to
  save it by redefining immiserization to mean not an absolute increase in
  misery, but merely a relative one. This gloss allowed a vast increase in
  empirical plausibility, since it accepted the fact that the workers were
  indeed getting better off under the capitalist system but went on to argue
  that they were not getting better off at the same rate as the capitalists.</p>
  <p>The problem with this revision lay not in its economic premises, but its
  political ones. Could one realistically believe that workers would overthrow
  an economic system that was continually improving their own lot, simply
  because that of the capitalist class was improving at a marginally better
  rate? Certainly, the workers might envy the capitalists; but such emotions
  simply could not supply the gigantic impetus required to overthrow a structure
  as massive as the capitalist system. Before the workers of a capitalist
  society could unite, they had to feel that they had literally nothing to lose
  — nothing to lose but their proverbial chains. For if they had homes and
  cars and boats and <span class="caps">rv</span>s to lose as well, then it
  became quite another matter.</p>
  <p>In short, the relative immiserization thesis was simply not the stuff that
  drives people to the barricades. At most it could fuel the gradualist reforms
  of the evolutionary ideal of socialism — a position identified with Eduard
  Bernstein.</p>
  <p>The post-World War II period demolished the last traces of the classical
  immiserization thesis. Workers in the most advanced capitalist countries were
  prosperous by any standard imaginable, either absolute or relative; and what
  is even more important, they felt themselves to be well off, and believed that
  the future would only make them and their children even better off than they
  had been in the past. This was a deadly blow to the immiserization thesis and
  hence to Marxism. For the failure of the immiserization thesis is in fact the
  failure of classical Marxism. If there is no misery, there is no revolution;
  and if there is no revolution, there is no socialism. Q.E.D. Socialism goes
  back once more to being merely a utopian fantasy.</p>
  <p>Yet those who still claim to derive their heritage from Marx are mostly
  unwilling to acknowledge that their political aims are merely utopian, not
  scientific. How is that possible?</p>
  <p>There might be several reasons advanced for this, but certainly one of them
  is Paul Baran. A Polish born American economist and a Marxist, Baran is the
  author of <i>The Political Economy of Growth</i> (Monthly Review Press, <span class="caps">1957</span>).
  In it, for the first time in Marxist literature, Baran propounded a causal
  connection between the prosperity of the advanced capitalist countries and the
  impoverishment of the Third World. It was no longer the case, as it was for
  Marx, that poverty — as well as idiocy — was the natural condition of man
  living in an agricultural mode of production. Rather, poverty had been
  introduced into the Third World by the capitalist system. The colonies no
  longer served the purpose of consuming overstocked inventories, but were now
  the positive victims of capitalism.</p>
  <p>What needs to be stressed here is that, prior to Baran, no Marxist had ever
  suspected that capitalism was the cause of the poverty of the rest of the
  world. Not only had Marx and Engels failed to notice this momentous fact, but
  neither had any of their followers. Yet this omission was certainly not due to
  Marx’s lack of knowledge about, or interest in, the question of European
  colonies. In his writing on India, Marx shows himself under no illusions
  concerning the brutal and mercenary nature of British rule. He is also aware
  of the “misery and degradation” effected by the impact of British
  industry’s “devastating effects” on India. Yet all of this is considered
  by Marx to be a dialectical necessity; that is to say, these effects were the
  unavoidable precondition of India’s progress and advance — an example of
  the “creative destruction” that Schumpeter spoke of as the essence of
  capitalist dynamics. Or, as Marx put it in <i>On Colonialism</i>: “[T]he
  English bourgeoisie . . . will neither emancipate nor materially mend the
  social condition of the mass of the [Indian] people . . . but . . . what they
  will not fail to do is to lay down the material premises for both” the
  emancipation and the mending of this social condition.</p>
  <p>The radical nature of Baran’s reformulation of Marxist doctrine is
  obscured by an understandable tendency to confuse Baran’s theory with
  Lenin’s earlier theory of imperialism. In fact, the two have nothing in
  common. Lenin’s theory had evolved in order to explain the continuing
  survival of capitalism into the early twentieth century, and hence the delay
  of the coming of socialism. In Lenin’s view, imperialism is not the cause of
  Third World immiserization, but rather a stopgap means of postponing
  immiserization in the capitalist countries themselves. It is the capitalist
  countries’ way of keeping their own work force relatively prosperous — and
  hence politically placid — by selling surplus goods into captive colonial
  markets. It is not a way of exploiting, much less impoverishing, these
  colonies. It was rather a way “to bribe the upper strata of the proletariat,
  and . . . to . . . strengthen opportunism,” as Lenin put it in <i>Imperialism:
  The Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> (International Publishers, <span class="caps">1933</span>).</p>
  <p>This gives us the proper perspective from which to judge the revolutionary
  quality of Baran’s reformulation. For, in essence, what Baran has done is to
  globalize the traditional doctrine of immiserization so that, instead of
  applying to the workers of the advanced capitalist countries, it now came to
  apply to the entire population of those countries that have not achieved
  advanced capitalism: It was the rest of the world that was being impoverished
  by capitalism, not the workers of the advanced countries.</p>
  <p>Baran’s global immiserization thesis, after its initial launch, was taken
  up by other Marxists, but it was nowhere given a more elaborate intellectual
  foundation than in Immanuel Wallerstein’s monumental study <i>The Modern
  World-System</i> (Academic Press, <span class="caps">1974</span>), which was
  essentially a fleshing out in greater historical and statistical detail of
  Baran’s thesis. Hence, for the sake of convenience, I will call the global
  immiserization thesis the Baran-Wallerstein revision.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">America

  would like to consider is not the thesis itself, but the role that this thesis
  played in bolstering and revitalizing late twentieth-century Marxism. For it
  is here that we find the intellectual origins of the international phenomenon
  of America-bashing. If there is any element of genuine seriousness in this
  movement — if, indeed, it aspires to be an objective and realistic
  assessment of the relationship of America to the rest of the world — then
  that element of seriousness is to be found in the global immiserization
  thesis: America has gotten rich by making other countries poor.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, this is no less true of those who, like Chomsky, have focused
  on what is seen as American military aggression against the rest of the world,
  for this aggression is understood as having its “root cause” in
  America’s systematic exploitation of the remainder of the human race. If
  American exploitation did not create misery, it would not need to use military
  force. It is the global immiserization thesis that makes the use of force an
  indispensable tool of American foreign policy and that is responsible,
  according to this view, for turning America into a terrorist state. This
  explains the absolute centrality of the global immiserization thesis in the
  creation of the specter of America now haunting so much of our world.</p>
  <p>The Baran-Wallerstein revision of the classical immiserization thesis into
  its global context was far better adapted to fix what was wrong in Marxist
  theory than the revisionist notion of relative immiserization discussed above.
  For, as we have seen, what was needed was real misery, and not merely
  comparative misery, since without such misery there would be no breakdown of
  capitalism: no civil war, no revolution, no socialism. And who can doubt that
  great real misery exists in the Third World?</p>
  <p>In addition to providing a new and previously untapped source of misery,
  the Baran-Wallerstein revision provided several other benefits. For example,
  there was no longer any difficulty in accepting the astonishingly high level
  of prosperity achieved by the work force of the advanced capitalist countries
  — indeed, it was now even possible to arraign the workers of these countries
  alongside of the capitalists for whom they labored — or, rather, more
  precisely, with whom they collaborated in order to exploit both the material
  resources and the cheap labor of the Third World. In the new configuration,
  both the workers and the capitalists of the advanced countries became the
  oppressor class, while it was the general population of the less advanced
  countries that became the oppressed — including, curiously enough, even the
  rulers of these countries, who often, to the untutored eye, seemed remarkably
  like oppressors themselves.</p>
  <p>With this demystification of the capitalist working class came an end to
  even a feigned enthusiasm among Marxists for solidarity with the hopelessly
  middle-class aspirations of the American blue-collar work force. The
  Baran-Wallerstein revision offered an exotic new object of sympathy —
  namely, the comfortably distant and abstract Third World victims of the
  capitalist world system.</p>
  <p>Perhaps most important, the Baran-Wallerstein revision also neatly solved
  the most pressing dilemma that worker prosperity in advanced capitalist
  countries bequeathed to classical Marxism: the absolute lack of revolutionary
  spirit among these workers — the very workers, it must be remembered, who
  were originally cast in the critical role of world revolutionaries. In the new
  theoretical configuration, this problem no longer mattered simply because the
  workers of the capitalist countries no longer mattered.</p>
  <p>Hence the appeal of the global immiserization thesis: The Baran-Wallerstein
  revision neatly obviates all the most outstanding objections to the classical
  Marxist theory. This leaves two questions unanswered: Is it true? And even if
  it is true, does it save Marxism?</p>
  <p>Whether the immiserization thesis is true or not is simply too complex a
  topic to deal with here. Indeed, for the sake of the present argument, I am
  willing to assume that it is absolutely true — truer than anything has ever
  been true before. For what I want to concentrate on is the question of whether
  the Baran-Wallerstein revision is consistent with Marxism’s claim to
  represent a realistic political agenda as opposed to a mere utopian fantasy.
  And the short answer is that, no matter how true the global immiserization
  thesis might be, it does not save the Baran-Wallerstein revision of Marxism
  from being condemned as utopian fantasy — and condemned not by my standards
  or yours, but by those of Marx and Engels.</p>
  <p>This is because the original immiserization thesis was set within the
  context of a class war <i>within</i> a society — an actual civil war between
  different classes of one and the same society, and not between different
  nations on different continents. This makes an enormous difference, for it is
  not at all unreasonable to think that a revolutionary movement could succeed,
  by means of a violent and bloody civil war, in gaining the monopoly of force
  within a capitalist society, and thus be able to dictate terms to the routed
  capitalists, if any survived.</p>
  <p>But this is an utterly different scenario from one in which the most
  advanced capitalist societies have a monopoly of force — and brutally
  effective force — at their disposal. For in this case it is absurd to think
  that the exploited Third World countries could possibly be able to alter the
  world order by even a hair, provided the advanced capitalist societies were
  intent on not being altered.</p>
  <p>What could <i>they</i> do to <i>us</i>?</p>

  <p><img alt src="T.GIF" align="left" border="0" width="70" height="55"><span class="caps">he answer
  to this</span> question, according to many of those who accept the global
  immiserization thesis, came on <span class="caps">9-11</span>. Noam Chomsky,
  perhaps America’s most celebrated proponent of the Baran-Wallerstein thesis,
  expressed this idea in the immediate aftermath. Here, for the first time, the
  world had witnessed the oppressed finally striking a blow against the
  oppressor — a politically immature blow, perhaps, comparable to the taking
  of the Bastille by the Parisian mob in its furious disregard of all laws of
  humanity, but still an act equally world-historical in its significance: the
  dawn of a new revolutionary era.</p>
  <p>This judgment can make sense only in the context of the Baran-Wallerstein
  thesis. For if <span class="caps">9-11</span> was in fact a realistic blow
  against the advanced capitalist countries — or even just the most advanced
  — then here was an escape from the utopian deadlock of the global
  immiserization thesis. Here was a way that the overthrow of world capitalism
  could be made a viable historical outcome once again, and not merely the
  fantastic delusions of a sect. This explains the otherwise baffling
  valorization of <span class="caps">9-11</span> on the part of the left — by
  which I mean the enormous world-historical significance that they have been
  prepared to attribute to al Qaeda’s act of terror.</p>
  <p>But was <span class="caps">9-11</span> truly world-historical in the
  precise sense required to sustain the Baran-Wallerstein revision? For <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  to be world-historical in this sense, it would have to contain within it the
  seeds of a gigantic shift in the order of things: something on the scale of
  the decline and collapse of capitalist America and with it the final
  realization of the socialist realm.</p>
  <p>But this investment of world-historical significance to <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  is simply wishful thinking on the part of the left. It is an effort to
  transform the demented acts of a group of fantasists into the vanguard of the
  world revolution. Because if there is to be a world revolution at all there
  has to be a vanguard of that revolution, an agent whose actions are such as to
  represent a threat to the capacity of the capitalist system simply to survive.
  This means that it is not enough to injure it; it is not enough to wound or
  madden it; it is not enough to rouse it to rage — the agent must kill it,
  too. He must be capable of overthrowing the hegemonic power at the center of
  the capitalist world system.</p>
  <p>But this is absolutely implausible. Any realistic assessment of any
  possible scenario will inevitably conclude that nothing that al Qaeda can do
  can cause the collapse of America and the capitalist system. The worse
  eventuality in the long run would be that America would be forced to break its
  hallowed ideal of universal tolerance, in order to make an exception of those
  who fit the racial profiling of an al Qaeda terrorist. It is ridiculous to
  think that if al Qaeda continued to attack us such measures would not be
  taken. They would be forced upon the government by the people (and anyone who
  thinks that the supposed cultural hegemony of the left might stop this
  populist fury is deluded).</p>
  <p>In other words, the only effect on America of a continuation of September <span class="caps">11</span>-style
  attacks would be an increasingly repressive state apparatus domestically and a
  populist home front demand for increasingly severe retaliation against those
  nations supporting or hiding terrorists. But neither one of these reactions
  would seriously undermine the strength of the United States — indeed, it is
  quite evident that further attacks would continue to unite the overwhelming
  majority of the American population, creating an irresistible “general
  will” to eradicate terrorism by any means necessary, including the most
  brutal and ruthless.</p>
  <p>But this condition, let us recall, is precisely the opposite of the
  objective political conditions that, according to Marx, must be present in
  order for capitalism to be overthrown. For classical Marxism demands, quite
  realistically, a state that is literally being torn apart by internal
  dissension. Revolution, in short, requires a full-fledged civil war <i>within
  the capitalist social order itself</i>, since nothing short of this can
  possibly achieve the goal that the revolution is seeking. Hence, <span class="caps">9-11</span>-style
  attacks that serve only to strengthen the already considerable solidarity
  between classes in the United States are, from the perspective of classical
  Marxism, fatally flawed. For such attacks not only fail to further any
  revolutionary aims; they actually make the revolution less probable. A society
  of <span class="caps">300</span> million individuals whose bumper stickers say
  “United We Stand” is not a breeding ground for revolutionary activity. Nor
  is it a society that can be easily intimidated into mending its ways, even if
  we make the assumption that its ways need mending.</p>
  <p>But if the result of <span class="caps">9-11</span> was to strengthen the
  political unity of the United States, then <span class="caps">9-11</span> was
  definitely not world-historical. The unspeakable human horror of <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  should not blind us to the ghastly triviality of the motive and the inevitable
  nullity of the aftermath.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">The
  temptation of fantasy ideology</span></font></p>
  <p><img alt src="T.GIF" align="left" border="0" width="70" height="55"><span class="caps">he
  baran-wallerstein</span> revision of Marxism does provide a new global
  reformulation of the immiserization thesis. But the locus of this misery, the
  Third World, does not and cannot provide an adequate objective foundation for
  a revolutionary struggle against the capitalist system. Rather, this
  foundation can be provided only by a majority of the workers in the advanced
  capitalist countries themselves; but, as we have seen, the effect of <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  on the working class of the United States was not one conducive to the
  overthrow and demise of capitalism. On the contrary, nowhere was the desire to
  retaliate against the terrorists more powerfully visceral than among the
  working class of the United States. The overwhelming majority of its members
  instantly responded with collective and spontaneous expression of solidarity
  with other Americans and expressions of outrage against those who had planned
  and carried out the attack, as well as those who attempted to palliate it.</p>
  <p>For those who are persuaded by the Baran-Wallerstein thesis, <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  represents a classic temptation. It is the temptation that every fantasy
  ideology offers to those who become caught up in it — the temptation to
  replace serious thought and analysis, fidelity to the facts and scrupulous
  objectivity, with the worst kind of wishful thinking. The attempt to cast <span class="caps">9-11</span>
  as a second taking of the Bastille simply overlooks what is most critical
  about both of these events, namely, that the Bastille was a symbol of
  oppression to the masses of French men and women who first overthrew it and
  then tore it down, brick by brick. And while it is true that the Bastille had
  become the stuff of fantasy, thanks to the pre-<span class="caps">1789</span>
  “horrors of the Bastille” literature, it was still a fantasy that worked
  potently on the minds of the Parisian mob and hence provided the objective
  political conditions necessary to undermine the Bourbon state. But the fantasy
  embodied in <span class="caps">9-11</span>, far from weakening the American
  political order, strengthened it immeasurably, while the only mobs that were
  motivated by the enactment of this fantasy were those inhabiting the Arab
  streets — a population pathetically unable to control even the most
  elementary aspects of its own political destiny, and hence scarcely the
  material out of which a realistically minded revolutionary could hope to
  fashion an instrument of world-historical transformation. These people are
  badly miscast in the role of the vanguard of the world revolution. And what
  can we say about those in the West, allegedly acting within the tradition of
  Marxist thought, who encourage such spectacularly utopian flights of fantasy?</p>
  <p>The Baran-Wallerstein thesis cannot save Marxism; and, in fact, it is a
  betrayal of what is genuinely valid in Marx — namely, the insistence that
  any realistic hope of a world-historical transformation from one stage of
  social organization to a more humane one can come only if men and women do not
  yield to the temptation of fantasy ideology, even — and, indeed, especially
  — when it is a fantasy ideology dressed up to look like Marxism.</p>
  <p>Instead, the Baran-Wallerstein thesis has sadly come to provide merely a
  theoretical justification for the most irrational and infantile forms of
  America-bashing. There is nothing Marxist about this. On the contrary,
  according to Marx, it was the duty of the non-utopian socialist, prior to the
  advent of genuine socialism, to support whatever state happened to represent
  the most fully developed and consistently carried out form of capitalism; and,
  indeed, it was his duty to defend it against the irrational onslaughts of
  those reactionary and backward forces that tried to thwart its development. In
  fact, this was a duty that Marx took upon himself, and nowhere more clearly
  than in his defense of the United States against the Confederacy in the Civil
  War. Only in this case he was defending capitalism against a fantasy ideology
  that, unlike that of radical Islam, wished to roll back the clock a mere
  handful of centuries, not several millennia.</p>
  <p>Those who, speaking in Marx’s name, try to defend the fantasy ideology
  embodied in <span class="caps">9-11</span> are betraying everything that Marx
  represented. They are replacing his hard-nosed insistence on realism with a
  self-indulgent flight into sheer fantasy, just as they are abandoning his
  strenuous commitment to pursuit of a higher stage of social organization in
  order to glorify the feudal regimes that the world has long since condemned to
  Marx’s own celebrated trash bin of history.</p>
  <p>America-bashing has sadly come to be “the opium of the intellectual,”
  to use the phrase Raymond Aron borrowed from Marx in order to characterize
  those who followed the latter into the twentieth century. And like opium it
  produces vivid and fantastic dreams.</p>
  <p>This is an intellectual tragedy. The Marxist left, whatever else one might
  say about it, has traditionally offered a valuable perspective from which even
  the greatest conservative thinkers have learned — including Schumpeter and
  Thomas Sowell. But if it cannot rid itself of its current penchant for fantasy
  ideology of the worst type, not only will it be incapable of serving this
  purpose; it will become worse than useless. It will become a justification for
  a return to that state of barbarism mankind has spent millennia struggling to
  transcend — a struggle that no one felt more keenly than Marx himself. For
  the essence of utopianism, according to Marx, is the refusal to acknowledge
  just how much suffering and pain every upward step of man’s ascent inflicts
  upon those who are taking it, and instead to dream that there are easier ways
  of getting there. There are not, and it is helpful to no party to pretend that
  there are. To argue that the great inequalities of wealth now existing between
  the advanced capitalist countries and the Third World can be cured by
  outbreaks of frenzied and irrational America-bashing is not only utopian; it
  is immoral.</p>
  <p>The left, if it is not to condemn itself to become a fantasy ideology, must
  reconcile itself not only with the reality of America, but with its
  dialectical necessity — America is the sine qua non of any future progress
  that mankind can make, no matter what direction that progress may take.</p>
  <p>The belief that mankind’s progress, by any conceivable standard of
  measurement recognized by Karl Marx, could be achieved through the destruction
  or even decline of American power is a dangerous delusion. Respect for the
  deep structural laws that govern the historical process — whatever these
  laws may be — must dictate a proportionate respect for any social order that
  has achieved the degree of stability and prosperity the United States has
  achieved and has been signally decisive in permitting other nations around the
  world to achieve as well. To ignore these facts in favor of surreal ideals and
  utterly utopian fantasies is a sign not merely of intellectual bankruptcy, but
  of a disturbing moral immaturity. For nothing indicates a failure to
  understand the nature of a moral principle better than to believe that it is
  capable of enforcing itself.</p>
  <p>It is not. It requires an entire social order to shelter and protect it.
  And if it cannot find these, it will perish.</p>
