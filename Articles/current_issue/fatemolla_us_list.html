        <p>BD is included in US's list of &quot;suspected (?)&quot; countries
        only because we<br>
        never bravely addressed the deadly problem that is very much ours; we
        only<br>
        played hide-n-seek with it. We will only fool ourselves and undermine<br>
        efficiency of US-Intelligence if we think that it decides on serious<br>
        International matters based on net-articles or political lectures. While<br>
        people of BD are secular, tolerant and peaceful, few voices have been
        highly<br>
        screaming about the definite presence of Islamic fanatic elements in BD
        with<br>
        an agenda of establishing Sharia-based Islamic state by violence.</p>
        <p>Let us pay due attention to what time has been whispering into our
        ears for<br>
        years, about our very own motherland. How many of these proofs will you<br>
        deny? Paper-cuttings are available on request.</p>
        <p><b>1. Dhaka, From Bhorer Kagoj, 20 July 2002.</b><br>
        At the rate of a conservative number of 5 per year, 64000 Madrasas in BD<br>
        generate 320000 students each year. If 10% of them are successfully
        poisoned<br>
        with Jihadi-Talebani Josh, 32000 Islami killers are produced each year.
        That<br>
        is scary, even half of that, 16000 per year. A more scary fact is that<br>
        nearly 57000 Madrasas are established only in last 27 years, many of
        those<br>
        without Government money. Who, for what reason spent so much money after<br>
        57000 Madrasas in 27 only years? That is, 2000 institutions each year!
        How<br>
        much money is needed for that? There must be a serious plan working
        behind<br>
        it.</p>
        <p><b>2. Dhaka 7th August 2000.</b><br>
        Jamal Shaker, the arrested leader of Harkatul Jihad informed that
        Harkatul<br>
        Jihad was born in BD with a goal of revolution in Afghan-style. He
        himself<br>
        is an Afghan Mujahid. The supreme leader of this movement Mufti Abdul
        Hannan<br>
        is a Mujahid himself, with a scar of bomb on his body in the Afghan war.<br>
        They have organized Harkatul Jihad during last seven / eight years. At<br>
        present it has nearly one hundred thousand members. But the trained
        members<br>
        are less.</p>
        <p><b>3. Dhaka 10th August 2000.</b><br>
        A Government Investigation Department reported that Harkatul Jihad has a<br>
        hundred thousand active members in BD under the leadership of eight
        persons<br>
        including Mufti Abdul Hannan and Abdul Mannan. All of them are trained
        in<br>
        Afghanistan and they are hiding in Madrasas in BD. Most of the teachers
        and<br>
        students of 641 private Madrasas are its members. Each year four to five<br>
        thousand students are sent to Afghanistan for training on arms and
        bombs.<br>
        They reach Pakistan via India, and then a Pakistani fundamentalist<br>
        organization takes them to Afghanistan. Then they take oath that they
        will<br>
        take part in any Jihad in any Muslim country.</p>
        <p><b>4. Dhaka 9th February 2001.</b><br>
        With a goal of capturing the Government by arms-revolution, Islami
        Chhatro<br>
        Shibir started arms training in the mountains of Chittagong before
        fifteen<br>
        years. To get this training free, Shibir decided to send its members to<br>
        Bangladesh Cadet Core. Also, whenever there is employment opportunity in<br>
        Defense Forces, Shibir sends selected members to ISSB. They already have<br>
        many members in Defense. Shibir also sends trained members to Bangladesh<br>
        Civil Service exam. They have members in Civil Service who give them<br>
        information and money.</p>
        <p><b>5. Dhaka 21st February 2001.</b><br>
        Two arrested top leaders of Rohinga Islamic Front (RIF) Selimullah and
        Nur<br>
        Muhammad informed police that RIF is deeply related with Jama?at-Shibir.
        RIF<br>
        supplies modern arms to Jama?at-Shibir. In return Jama?at-Shibir gives
        them<br>
        money and shelter.</p>
        <p><b>6. Dhaka 23 January 2001.</b><br>
        On 23rd October 2000 Maolana Ismail, the Imam of Jame-Mosque tempted 7
        boys<br>
        with the hope of jobs and kidnapped them to an unknown place in Rangunia.<br>
        Then they were taken to the Sundarbans by a speedboat and were forced to<br>
        arms training. Iqbal, one of the boys ran away from there and informed
        about<br>
        it. Police arrested Maolana Ismail.</p>
        <p><b>7. Dhaka 20 th October 2000.</b><br>
        Abdul Goni, lecturer of Boda College in Ponchogor is a son of Abdul
        Rashid,<br>
        a Razakar of 1971. When Abdul Goni was a student of Rajshahi University,
        he<br>
        was the President of Shibir of Joha Hall. Recently he established a
        Madrasa<br>
        in his house with security-fence and started arms training in Talebani-style<br>
        to three hundred students in different places of Neelphamari and
        Ponchogor.<br>
        This was published in Daily Jonokontho and after police arrested Abdul
        Goni,<br>
        the local journalist of Jonokontho is given death-threat from Harkatul<br>
        Jihad.</p>
        <p><b>8. Dhaka 30th July 2000.</b><br>
        In 2nd week of July, a group of seven / eight Pakistani, Sudanese and<br>
        Afghani people came to BD secretly and conducted secret meeting s with
        the<br>
        leaders of Harkatul Jihad in southern BD. They talked about increase of<br>
        their Talebani activities, procurement of arms for the revolution,<br>
        recruitment of Mujahids, etc. The movement started in Coxsbazar and<br>
        Bandarban and is spread in different parts of BD.</p>
        <p>There are other proofs. The devil's horn lies in the report that in
        most of<br>
        the Madrasas in BD, our National Anthem was never sung. If it happens in
        any<br>
        other nation, they will deal with these institutions with an iron hand.</p>
        <p>It is true that recently the devil received a blow in Afghanistan.
        But it is<br>
        also true that it is very difficult to kill a philosophy, be it a
        poisonous<br>
        one. The devil is not killed. There is every possibility that it will
        make<br>
        another effort to establish itself elsewhere on human blood and
        skeletons.<br>
        If it happens in BD, a deadly clash is inevitable with a definite<br>
        possibility of ?Another Three Million?.</p>
        <p>WHO CAN STOP ALLAH'S KILLERS? NOT ANY UNITED STATES BUT THE COMMON
        PEACEFUL<br>
        MUSLIMS, UNITED TOGETHER.<br>
