              <p>On the steel torsos of their missiles, adolescent American
              soldiers scrawl colorful messages in childish handwriting: For
              Saddam, from the Fat Boy Posse. A building goes down. A
              marketplace. A home. A girl who loves a boy. A child who only ever
              wanted to play with his older brother's marbles.
              <p>On March 21, the day after American and British troops began
              their illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq, an
              &quot;embedded&quot; CNN correspondent interviewed an American
              soldier. &quot;I wanna get in there and get my nose dirty,&quot;
              Private AJ said. &quot;I wanna take revenge for 9/11.&quot;
              <p><img alt="Arundhati Roy" hspace="14" src="arundhatiroy.jpg" align="left" vspace="14" border="0" width="125" height="135">To
              be fair to the correspondent, even though he was
              &quot;embedded&quot; he did sort of weakly suggest that so far
              there was no real evidence that linked the Iraqi government to the
              September 11 attacks. Private AJ stuck his teenage tongue out all
              the way down to the end of his chin. &quot;Yeah, well that stuff's
              way over my head,&quot; he said.
              <p>According to a New York Times/CBS News survey, 42 per cent of
              the American public believes that Saddam Hussein is directly
              responsible for the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
              and the Pentagon. And an ABC news poll says that 55 per cent of
              Americans believe that Saddam Hussein directly supports al-Qaida.
              What percentage of America's armed forces believe these
              fabrications is anybody's guess.
              <p>It is unlikely that British and American troops fighting in
              Iraq are aware that their governments supported Saddam Hussein
              both politically and financially through his worst excesses.
              <p>But why should poor AJ and his fellow soldiers be burdened with
              these details? It does not matter any more, does it? Hundreds of
              thousands of men, tanks, ships, choppers, bombs, ammunition, gas
              masks, high-protein food, whole aircrafts ferrying toilet paper,
              insect repellent, vitamins and bottled mineral water, are on the
              move. The phenomenal logistics of Operation Iraqi Freedom make it
              a universe unto itself. It doesn't need to justify its existence
              any more. It exists. It is.
              <p>President George W Bush, commander in chief of the US army,
              navy, air force and marines has issued clear instructions:
              &quot;Iraq. Will. Be. Liberated.&quot; (Perhaps he means that even
              if Iraqi people's bodies are killed, their souls will be
              liberated.) American and British citizens owe it to the supreme
              commander to forsake thought and rally behind their troops. Their
              countries are at war. And what a war it is.
              <p>After using the &quot;good offices&quot; of UN diplomacy
              (economic sanctions and weapons inspections) to ensure that Iraq
              was brought to its knees, its people starved, half a million of
              its children killed, its infrastructure severely damaged, after
              making sure that most of its weapons have been destroyed, in an
              act of cowardice that must surely be unrivalled in history, the
              &quot;Allies&quot;/&quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot;(better
              known as the Coalition of the Bullied and Bought) - sent in an
              invading army!
              <p>Operation Iraqi Freedom? I don't think so. It's more like
              Operation Let's Run a Race, but First Let Me Break Your Knees.
              <p>So far the Iraqi army, with its hungry, ill-equipped soldiers,
              its old guns and ageing tanks, has somehow managed to temporarily
              confound and occasionally even outmaneuver the &quot;Allies&quot;.
              Faced with the richest, best-equipped, most powerful armed forces
              the world has ever seen, Iraq has shown spectacular courage and
              has even managed to put up what actually amounts to a defense. A
              defense which the Bush/Blair Pair have immediately denounced as
              deceitful and cowardly. (But then deceit is an old tradition with
              us natives. When we are invaded/ colonized/occupied and stripped
              of all dignity, we turn to guile and opportunism.)

              Even allowing for the fact that Iraq and the &quot;Allies&quot;
              are at war, the extent to which the &quot;Allies&quot; and their
              media cohorts are prepared to go is astounding to the point of
              being counterproductive to their own objectives.
              <p>When Saddam Hussein appeared on national TV to address the
              Iraqi people after the failure of the most elaborate assassination
              attempt in history - &quot;Operation Decapitation&quot; - we had
              Geoff Hoon, the British defense secretary, deriding him for not
              having the courage to stand up and be killed, calling him a coward
              who hides in trenches. We then had a flurry of Coalition
              speculation - Was it really Saddam, was it his double? Or was it
              Osama with a shave? Was it pre-recorded? Was it a speech? Was it
              black magic? Will it turn into a pumpkin if we really, really want
              it to?
              <p>After dropping not hundreds, but thousands of bombs on Baghdad,
              when a marketplace was mistakenly blown up and civilians killed -
              a US army spokesman implied that the Iraqis were blowing
              themselves up! &quot;They're using very old stock. Their missiles
              go up and come down.&quot;
              <p>If so, may we ask how this squares with the accusation that the
              Iraqi regime is a paid-up member of the Axis of Evil and a threat
              to world peace?
              <p>When the Arab TV station al-Jazeera shows civilian casualties
              it's denounced as &quot;emotive&quot; Arab propaganda aimed at
              orchestrating hostility towards the &quot;Allies&quot;, as though
              Iraqis are dying only in order to make the &quot;Allies&quot; look
              bad. Even French television has come in for some stick for similar
              reasons. But the awed, breathless footage of aircraft carriers,
              stealth bombers and cruise missiles arcing across the desert sky
              on American and British TV is described as the &quot;terrible
              beauty&quot; of war.
              <p>When invading American soldiers (from the army &quot;that's
              only here to help&quot;) are taken prisoner and shown on Iraqi TV,
              George Bush says it violates the Geneva convention and
              &quot;exposes the evil at the heart of the regime&quot;. But it is
              entirely acceptable for US television stations to show the
              hundreds of prisoners being held by the US government in
              Guantanamo Bay, kneeling on the ground with their hands tied
              behind their backs, blinded with opaque goggles and with earphones
              clamped on their ears, to ensure complete visual and aural
              deprivation. When questioned about the treatment of these
              prisoners, US Government officials don't deny that they're being
              being ill-treated. They deny that they're &quot;prisoners of
              war&quot;! They call them &quot;unlawful combatants&quot;,
              implying that their ill-treatment is legitimate! (So what's the
              party line on the massacre of prisoners in Mazar-e-Sharif,
              Afghanistan? Forgive and forget? And what of the prisoner tortured
              to death by the special forces at the Bagram air force base?
              Doctors have formally called it homicide.)
              <p>When the &quot;Allies&quot; bombed the Iraqi television station
              (also, incidentally, a contravention of the Geneva convention),
              there was vulgar jubilation in the American media. In fact Fox TV
              had been lobbying for the attack for a while. It was seen as a
              righteous blow against Arab propaganda. But mainstream American
              and British TV continue to advertise themselves as
              &quot;balanced&quot; when their propaganda has achieved
              hallucinatory levels.
              <p>Why should propaganda be the exclusive preserve of the western
              media? Just because they do it better? Western journalists
              &quot;embedded&quot; with troops are given the status of heroes
              reporting from the frontlines of war. Non-&quot;embedded&quot;
              journalists (such as the BBC's Rageh Omaar, reporting from
              besieged and bombed Baghdad, witnessing, and clearly affected by
              the sight of bodies of burned children and wounded people) are
              undermined even before they begin their reportage: &quot;We have
              to tell you that he is being monitored by the Iraqi
              authorities.&quot;
              <p>Increasingly, on British and American TV, Iraqi soldiers are
              being referred to as &quot;militia&quot; (ie: rabble). One BBC
              correspondent portentously referred to them as
              &quot;quasi-terrorists&quot;. Iraqi defense is
              &quot;resistance&quot; or worse still, &quot;pockets of
              resistance&quot;, Iraqi military strategy is deceit. (The US
              government bugging the phone lines of UN security council
              delegates, reported by the Observer, is hard-headed pragmatism.)
              Clearly for the &quot;Allies&quot;, the only morally acceptable
              strategy the Iraqi army can pursue is to march out into the desert
              and be bombed by B-52s or be mowed down by machine-gun fire.
              Anything short of that is cheating.
              <p>And now we have the siege of Basra. About a million and a half
              people, 40 per cent of them children. Without clean water, and
              with very little food. We're still waiting for the legendary Shia
              &quot;uprising&quot;, for the happy hordes to stream out of the
              city and rain roses and hosannahs on the &quot;liberating&quot;
              army. Where are the hordes? Don't they know that television
              productions work to tight schedules? (It may well be that if
              Saddam's regime falls there will be dancing on the streets of
              Basra. But then, if the Bush regime were to fall, there would be
              dancing on the streets the world over.)
              <p>After days of enforcing hunger and thirst on the citizens of
              Basra, the &quot;Allies&quot; have brought in a few trucks of food
              and water and positioned them tantalizingly on the outskirts of
              the city. Desperate people flock to the trucks and fight each
              other for food. (The water we hear, is being sold. To revitalize
              the dying economy, you understand.) On top of the trucks,
              desperate photographers fought each other to get pictures of
              desperate people fighting each other for food. Those pictures will
              go out through photo agencies to newspapers and glossy magazines
              that pay extremely well. Their message: The messiahs are at hand,
              distributing fishes and loaves.
              <p>As of July last year the delivery of $5.4bn worth of supplies
              to Iraq was blocked by the Bush/Blair Pair. It didn't really make
              the news. But now under the loving caress of live TV, 450 tonnes
              of humanitarian aid - a minuscule fraction of what's actually
              needed (call it a script prop) - arrived on a British ship, the
              &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;. Its arrival in the port of Umm Qasr
              merited a whole day of live TV broadcasts. Barf bag, anyone?
              <p>Nick Guttmann, head of emergencies for Christian Aid, writing
              for the Independent on Sunday said that it would take 32 Sir
              Galahad's a day to match the amount of food Iraq was receiving
              before the bombing began.
              <p>We oughtn't to be surprised though. It's old tactics. They've
              been at it for years. Consider this moderate proposal by John
              McNaughton from the Pentagon Papers, published during the Vietnam
              war: &quot;Strikes at population targets (per se) are likely not
              only to create a counterproductive wave of revulsion abroad and at
              home, but greatly to increase the risk of enlarging the war with
              China or the Soviet Union. Destruction of locks and dams, however
              - if handled right - might ... offer promise. It should be
              studied. Such destruction does not kill or drown people. By
              shallow-flooding the rice, it leads after time to widespread
              starvation (more than a million?) unless food is provided - which
              we could offer to do 'at the conference table'.&quot;
              <p>Times haven't changed very much. The technique has evolved into
              a doctrine. It's called &quot;Winning Hearts and Minds&quot;.
              <p>So, here's the moral maths as it stands: 200,000 Iraqis
              estimated to have been killed in the first Gulf war. Hundreds of
              thousands dead because of the economic sanctions. (At least that
              lot has been saved from Saddam Hussein.) More being killed every
              day. Tens of thousands of US soldiers who fought the 1991 war
              officially declared &quot;disabled&quot; by a disease called the
              Gulf war syndrome, believed in part to be caused by exposure to
              depleted uranium. It hasn't stopped the &quot;Allies&quot; from
              continuing to use depleted uranium.
              <p>And now this talk of bringing the UN back into the picture. But
              that old UN girl - it turns out that she just ain't what she was
              cracked up to be. She's been demoted (although she retains her
              high salary). Now she's the world's janitor. She's the Philippino
              cleaning lady, the Indian jamadarni, the postal bride from
              Thailand, the Mexican household help, the Jamaican au pair. She's
              employed to clean other peoples' shit. She's used and abused at
              will.
              <p>Despite Blair's earnest submissions, and all his fawning, Bush
              has made it clear that the UN will play no independent part in the
              administration of postwar Iraq. The US will decide who gets those
              juicy &quot;reconstruction&quot; contracts. But Bush has appealed
              to the international community not to &quot;politicize&quot; the
              issue of humanitarian aid. On the March 28, after Bush called for
              the immediate resumption of the UN's oil for food program, the UN
              security council voted unanimously for the resolution. This means
              that everybody agrees that Iraqi money (from the sale of Iraqi
              oil) should be used to feed Iraqi people who are starving because
              of US led sanctions and the illegal US-led war.
              <p>Contracts for the &quot;reconstruction&quot; of Iraq we're
              told, in discussions on the business news, could jump-start the
              world economy. It's funny how the interests of American
              corporations are so often, so successfully and so deliberately
              confused with the interests of the world economy. While the
              American people will end up paying for the war, oil companies,
              weapons manufacturers, arms dealers, and corporations involved in
              &quot;reconstruction&quot; work will make direct gains from the
              war. Many of them are old friends and former employers of the
              Bush/ Cheney/Rumsfeld/Rice cabal. Bush has already asked Congress
              for $75bn. Contracts for &quot;re-construction&quot; are already
              being negotiated. The news doesn't hit the stands because much of
              the US corporate media is owned and managed by the same interests.
              <p>Operation Iraqi Freedom, Tony Blair assures us is about
              returning Iraqi oil to the Iraqi people. That is, returning Iraqi
              oil to the Iraqi people via corporate multinationals. Like Shell,
              like Chevron, like Halliburton. Or are we missing the plot here?
              Perhaps Halliburton is actually an Iraqi company? Perhaps US
              vice-president Dick Cheney (who is a former director of
              Halliburton) is a closet Iraqi?
              <p>As the rift between Europe and America deepens, there are signs
              that the world could be entering a new era of economic boycotts.
              CNN reported that Americans are emptying French wine into gutters,
              chanting, &quot;We don't want your stinking wine.&quot; We've
              heard about the re-baptism of French fries. Freedom fries they're
              called now. There's news trickling in about Americans boycotting
              German goods. The thing is that if the fallout of the war takes
              this turn, it is the US who will suffer the most. Its homeland may
              be defended by border patrols and nuclear weapons, but its economy
              is strung out across the globe. Its economic outposts are exposed
              and vulnerable to attack in every direction. Already the internet
              is buzzing with elaborate lists of American and British government
              products and companies that should be boycotted. Apart from the
              usual targets, Coke, Pepsi and McDonald's - government agencies
              such as USAID, the British department for international
              development, British and American banks, Arthur Anderson, Merrill
              Lynch, American Express, corporations such as Bechtel, General
              Electric, and companies such as Reebok, Nike and Gap - could find
              themselves under siege. These lists are being honed and re fined
              by activists across the world. They could become a practical guide
              that directs and channels the amorphous, but growing fury in the
              world. Suddenly, the &quot;inevitability&quot; of the project of
              corporate globalization is beginning to seem more than a little
              evitable.
              <p>It's become clear that the war against terror is not really
              about terror, and the war on Iraq not only about oil. It's about a
              superpower's self-destructive impulse towards supremacy,
              stranglehold, global hegemony. The argument is being made that the
              people of Argentina and Iraq have both been decimated by the same
              process. Only the weapons used against them differ: In one case
              it's an IMF checkbook. In the other, cruise missiles.
              <p>Finally, there's the matter of Saddam's arsenal of weapons of
              mass destruction. (Oops, nearly forgot about those!)
              <p>In the fog of war - one thing's for sure - if Saddam 's regime
              indeed has weapons of mass destruction, it is showing an
              astonishing degree of responsibility and restraint in the teeth of
              extreme provocation. Under similar circumstances, (say if Iraqi
              troops were bombing New York and laying siege to Washington DC)
              could we expect the same of the Bush regime? Would it keep its
              thousands of nuclear warheads in their wrapping paper? What about
              its chemical and biological weapons? Its stocks of anthrax,
              smallpox and nerve gas? Would it?
              <p>Excuse me while I laugh.
              <p>In the fog of war we're forced to speculate: Either Saddam is
              an extremely responsible tyrant. Or - he simply does not possess
              weapons of mass destruction. Either way, regardless of what
              happens next, Iraq comes out of the argument smelling sweeter than
              the US government.
              <p>So here's Iraq - rogue state, grave threat to world peace,
              paid-up member of the Axis of Evil. Here's Iraq, invaded, bombed,
              besieged, bullied, its sovereignty shat upon, its children killed
              by cancers, its people blown up on the streets. And here's all of
              us watching. CNN-BBC, BBC-CNN late into the night. Here's all of
              us, enduring the horror of the war, enduring the horror of the
              propaganda and enduring the slaughter of language as we know and
              understand it. Freedom now means mass murder (or, in the US, fried
              potatoes). When someone says &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; we
              automatically go looking for induced starvation.
              &quot;Embedded&quot; I have to admit, is a great find. It's what
              it sounds like. And what about &quot;arsenal of tactics?&quot;
              Nice!
              <p>In most parts of the world, the invasion of Iraq is being seen
              as a racist war. The real danger of a racist war unleashed by
              racist regimes is that it engenders racism in everybody -
              perpetrators, victims, spectators. It sets the parameters for the
              debate, it lays out a grid for a particular way of thinking. There
              is a tidal wave of hatred for the US rising from the ancient heart
              of the world. In Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, Australia. I
              encounter it every day. Sometimes it comes from the most unlikely
              sources. Bankers, businessmen, yuppie students, and they bring to
              it all the crassness of their conservative, illiberal politics.
              That absurd inability to separate governments from people: America
              is a nation of morons, a nation of murderers, they say, (with the
              same carelessness with which they say, &quot;All Muslims are
              terrorists&quot;). Even in the grotesque universe of racist
              insult, the British make their entry as add-ons. Arse-lickers,
              they're called.
              <p>Suddenly, I, who have been vilified for being
              &quot;anti-American&quot; and &quot;anti-west&quot;, find myself
              in the extraordinary position of defending the people of America.
              And Britain.
              <p>Those who descend so easily into the pit of racist abuse would
              do well to remember the hundreds of thousands of American and
              British citizens who protested against their country's stockpile
              of nuclear weapons. And the thousands of American war resisters
              who forced their government to withdraw from Vietnam. They should
              know that the most scholarly, scathing, hilarious critiques of the
              US government and the &quot;American way of life&quot; comes from
              American citizens. And that the funniest, most bitter condemnation
              of their prime minister comes from the British media. Finally they
              should remember that right now, hundreds of thousands of British
              and American citizens are on the streets protesting the war. The
              Coalition of the Bullied and Bought consists of governments, not
              people. More than one third of America's citizens have survived
              the relentless propaganda they've been subjected to, and many
              thousands are actively fighting their own government. In the
              ultra-patriotic climate that prevails in the US, that's as brave
              as any Iraqi fighting for his or her homeland.
              <p>While the &quot;Allies&quot; wait in the desert for an uprising
              of Shia Muslims on the streets of Basra, the real uprising is
              taking place in hundreds of cities across the world. It has been
              the most spectacular display of public morality ever seen.
              <p>Most courageous of all, are the hundreds of thousands of
              American people on the streets of America's great cities -
              Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco. The fact is that the
              only institution in the world today that is more powerful than the
              American government, is American civil society. American citizens
              have a huge responsibility riding on their shoulders. How can we
              not salute and support those who not only acknowledge but act upon
              that responsibility? They are our allies, our friends.
              <p>At the end of it all, it remains to be said that dictators like
              Saddam Hussein, and all the other despots in the Middle East, in
              the central Asian republics, in Africa and Latin America, many of
              them installed, supported and financed by the US government, are a
              menace to their own people. Other than strengthening the hand of
              civil society (instead of weakening it as has been done in the
              case of Iraq), there is no easy, pristine way of dealing with
              them. (It's odd how those who dismiss the peace movement as
              utopian, don't hesitate to proffer the most absurdly dreamy
              reasons for going to war: to stamp out terrorism, install
              democracy, eliminate fascism, and most entertainingly, to
              &quot;rid the world of evil-doers&quot;.)
              <p>Regardless of what the propaganda machine tells us, these
              tin-pot dictators are not the greatest threat to the world. The
              real and pressing danger, the greatest threat of all is the
              locomotive force that drives the political and economic engine of
              the US government, currently piloted by George Bush. Bush-bashing
              is fun, because he makes such an easy, sumptuous target. It's true
              that he is a dangerous, almost suicidal pilot, but the machine he
              handles is far more dangerous than the man himself.
              <p>Despite the pall of gloom that hangs over us today, I'd like to
              file a cautious plea for hope: in times of war, one wants one's
              weakest enemy at the helm of his forces. And President George W
              Bush is certainly that. Any other even averagely intelligent US
              president would have probably done the very same things, but would
              have managed to smoke-up the glass and confuse the opposition.
              Perhaps even carry the UN with him. Bush's tactless imprudence and
              his brazen belief that he can run the world with his riot squad,
              has done the opposite. He has achieved what writers, activists and
              scholars have striven to achieve for decades. He has exposed the
              ducts. He has placed on full public view the working parts, the
              nuts and bolts of the apocalyptic apparatus of the American
              empire.
              <p>Now that the blueprint (The Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire)
              has been put into mass circulation, it could be disabled quicker
              than the pundits predicted.
              <p>Bring on the spanners.
