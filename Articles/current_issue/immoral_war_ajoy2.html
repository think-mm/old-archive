          system of preserving peace and preventing war between its member
          countries, but they have shown little or no respect to world opinion
          against war. Thus on every count the war is immoral and unethical. But
          who cares, when the most powerful nation willfully belittle the
          functioning of UNO. The future of UNO and many world bodies engaged in
          making this world a peaceful habitable place are at stake, so also the

          the freedom loving Kurdish people in the past. We also know that in
          Iraq there exists no democracy. He had made a powerful coterie sharing
          all state powers. And most of the members of the inner circle are his
          kith and keens including his two son Uday and Qasar. We also know that
          no one can be elected to the Iraqi parliament if he is not a member of
          his Baath party. In a nutshell his regime is an out and out autocratic
          wherein peoples opinion is rarely reflected. In the past his regime,
          probably still now, had eliminated his political opponents in a
          terrorist way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>All these

          world phenomenon no ruler or even a democratically elected government

          the interest of its people or a section of people, particularly in
          human rights affairs, surely the world community has right to
          intervene. But this must be done through an international system like
          UNO. If UNO is found wanting in this respect, the world community must
          think seriously how to make the present world body more effective and
          assertive. In this 'International Peace Keeping system' no power,

          you think this is a state terrorism you are bringing in Iraq. If Laden
          is a terrorist, just an individual, his power is limited, but you, Mr.
          Bush,- are you not using state machinery of a most powerful country to
          unleash terrorism on peace loving Iraqi people ? If any one calls you
          the 'worst terrorist', can you blame him ? Can you defend yourself
          against this charge Mr. President ? If Saddam is charged with forcible
          occupation of Iraqi state power in an undemocratic methodology, do
          remember Mr. President how did you get elected ? Is your election to
          seat of power of USA truly reflected the majority of American people.
          You know very well, how you were elected through highly controversial
          election in the state of Florida. Your opponent were a gentle man, he
          accepted the so-called defeat only for the greater interest of the
          country. But you did not show any such move; you could have asked for
          a fresh election all over. But you didn't because you are not great. A
          greatness had been thrust on you. But you still remain a small man as
          your aggression against Iraq proved it beyond. To you sufferings of
          the Iraqi people and of your people matter little. Americans
          constitute a great nation, but I feel pity for them that in the
          beginning of the new millennium the nation got a worst president in
          the history of America. Ask your conscience Mr. President, isn't an
          aggression against humanity? Are you not committing genocide on Iraqi
          people ? Saddam may be at fault, but surely the children of Iraq,
          women of Iraq, elites of Iraq didn't commit any wrong for which they
          have to be punished by your barbarous solders. Why did you abandon the
          peaceful way of punishing or removing Saddam when the World body was
          trying its best to find a peaceful way? But your arrogance of power
          and personal vengeance against Saddam Mr. Bush, blinded you, took away
          your conscience and little human values that you had once. This is why
          I call this war an immoral thrust on Iraqi People. <o:p>

        all other powers including France, Germany, and Russia were trying to
        find a solution alternative to war through UNO and security council, you
        gave an ultimatum (7 a.m. BD time, 19th March) of 48 hours to Saddam
        leaving the country with his family including his two sons. You in your
        TV broadcast asked Iraqi people not to support Saddam in your noble
        mission of freeing Iraqi people from the hand of the demon Saddam. But
        today, on the 6th day of the war against world saw that you failed to
        isolate Iraqi people from the dictator. There had been no sign of it
        that Iraqi soldiers or the people took arms against Saddam. Here lies
        your failure Mr. President. Even the Pope John Paul sharply reacted for
        giving such an ultimatum when said 'The USA and its supporters would be
        held responsible for committing aggression on Iraq.'&nbsp; A mouthpiece
        of Vatican City said that those countries that would go to war without
        international unity would be held responsible to the God and the
        history. Reacting sharply, the France-President Jack commented that
        there were no moral justification to attack Iraq unilaterally. A high
        official in Russia expressing the reaction of Russian Government said
        that If USA attacked Iraq Russia would try its best for restoring peace
        in the area. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that imposing war
        against Iraq could not justifiable on the plea that Iraq poses a threat
        to world peace. Even the Arab league rejected Bush's ultimatum
        challenging its international lawful legality. </font><font face="Verdana Ref"><o:p>

  you ignore the UNO resolution of finding peaceful solution of Iraq and defied
  the Security Council. Didn't you warn the members of the council to go your
  way? You did not allow the security council to function for finding a peaceful
  path. If a punitive measure, including war, is to be taken against a member
  state it must be carried out with the sanction of the UNO. Even your European
  colleagues did not agree with you. You successfully split the European states.
  President Bush not only brought distress to Iraqi people but also undermined
  the status of the world body and its future is obviously at stake. If UNO
  could not function as it did in the past weaker nations and its people would
  be exposed to danger in many ways. Here in our concern is mush deeper. Because
  Mr. Bush ignoring the wishes of the UNO and Security Council and the opinions
  of the other world powers staged an aggression I call it an immoral war.</font></span><font face="Verdana Ref"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="color: windowtext"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">On
  all counts Iraq is weak country, militarily speaking. The allied power had
  deployed 225 thousand USA and 45 thousand British Soldiers with not less than
  600 war fighters and not less than 50 naval ships with innumerable numbers of
  Cruise Missiles capable of hitting precisely any target in Iraq as against 350
  thousand Iraqi solders and 15 thousand special guard regime with practically
  no air fighters plus a few Skud missiles. Can a super power like USA allied
  with another big power UK stage a war against a nation because its ruler is
  dictator posing a military threat against world peace. This is why I call it

  political front Arab league called for immediate ceasefire and stop to war,

  Probably Security council is meeting today.<o:p>
