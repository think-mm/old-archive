          <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000080">America is but one country
          in a world of over 200 countries. Like any country, America looks
          after its own interests first. In its dealings with other nations, it
          has often demonstrated a disturbing willingness to sacrifice human
          rights for the sake of political expediency and its own material
          interests. Despite this, can you name one country that would not,
          given the requisite political and economic power, act in a similar
          fashion? All countries in the world have been guilty of some abuse of
          human rights, if not have also engaged in outright genocide against
          either their own citizens or those of other countries. America is not
          alone in this regard. The law governing the International relations is
          the law of the jungle. In jungle each beast is after its own
          interests.</font></p>

          <p class="MsoNormal">This is an irrefutable argument. By this argument
          of course the acts of every genocide and cruelty becomes justifyable
          because one can always ask a rhetorical question &quot;Can you name a
          country which would not act this or that way.&quot; Every country has
          its share of sin but that does not absolve any other country from its
          own dirty laundry. America is responsible for its dirty acts and
          pointing fingers at other countries won't help.</p>

            Yes this boils my blood. Yes this makes me angry. But instead
            of&nbsp; placing the blame and anger solely at America's feet for
            what&nbsp; happened, let us retrace this history to see how it
            actually&nbsp; unfolded. When in 1979 the IRI (Islamic Republic of
            Iran) took&nbsp; American diplomats as hostages and millions of
            Iranians were&nbsp; shouting &quot;marg bar Amrika&quot; , or death
            to America and were saying&nbsp; &quot;Today Kabala, tomorrow Qods
            (Jerusalem)&quot;, Iran was at the&nbsp; beginning of a revolution
            that would turn it into a rogue nation.&nbsp; The mullahs, or
            spiritual leaders of Iran, were not withholding or&nbsp; covering up
            their expansionist, political ambitions for Islam. Out&nbsp; of this
            revolution this new country, now the Islamic Republic of&nbsp; Iran,
            became upfront in its goal of exporting this revolution to&nbsp;
            other Islamic countries. In so doing this Iran suddenly became
            a&nbsp; threat to the peace and the security of the Middle East as
            well as&nbsp;&nbsp; to the rest of the world. For this reason the
            IRI had to be&nbsp; contained or the consequences would have been
            too devastating.&nbsp;</font></p>
