          is 25<sup>th</sup> March. It flashed back in my mind the horror and
          ferocity of Pakistani army action I witnessed in that dreadful night.
          No I will never forget this night nor I will ever forgive those
          Pakistani hyenas in human form. To our estimate at least 10 thousand
          poor men and women were brutally killed by those hyenas on that very
          night, let loose by the army junta of Pakistan led by that beast named

          of the two nights 25<sup>th</sup> Marc and 21<sup>st</sup> March is
          too close to my assessment. My natural sympathy goes with suffering
          people of Iraq and condemned Bush as I did once Yahya.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

          am mortified, dejected and my conscience, in tune with the millions of
          common men and women of the world, is crying with despair, pain and
          anguish. Despair- because I can’t do anything to prevent or stop it,
          pain- because I have seen what and how war could bring distress and
          sufferings to the common men of the country on which the war is thrust
          upon by the maniac war mongers, anguish- because the peace loving
          world failed to prevent it. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></font></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Today, I only wish that the
          nightmares of the Iraqi people- the common men, women, children, sick
          &amp; disabled, should end the quickest way. How to do it ? I have no
          answer. I can as a humanist issue statement, participate in protest
          meetings and anti-war demonstrations or show black flags in front of
          the US embassy and submit memorandum condemning Bush’s military
          action urging him to bring an end of it forthwith. But I knew in my
          heart that all those civilized actions of ours would not do anything.
          But why ? Because I believe the war thrust on Iraq is a personal
          account on the part of the US president to settle with Saddam Hosain,
          the all-powerful dictator of Iraqi Republic. After the last gulf war
          in 1991, the senior Bush had expected that Saddam could be eliminated
          from Iraqi seat of power by CIA designed conspiracy or would be thrown
          out by Iraqi people themselves after this humiliating defeat at the
          hands of the US led allied power and the devastation and immense
          sufferings they witnessed during the one sided war. Instead, Saddam
          not only continued to reign Iraq but since the gulf war he had emerged
          more powerful consolidating his dictatorial power over Iraq and its
          people and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>establishing
          total control on the state machinery in spite of economic sanction and
          other punitive measures, endorsed by UNO and other countries against
          Iraq. During these days Iraqi people suffered but could not or did not
          overthrow Saddam Hossain either through ballot or by any military
          coup-de-tat. This enraged the senior Bush who in spite of all his
          efforts failed to eliminate Saddam from the scene of Iraq. The junior
          Bush as legacy has inherited this frustration coupled with rage and
          spirit of vengeance from his father. Since the successful war against
          Taliban Government of Afghanistan with the support and blessings of
          all democratic and peace loving people who opposed fundamentalism,
          obscurantism, terrorism, extreme conservatism and oppression on the
          common people of Afghanistan, particularly on womenfolk the junior
          Bush put himself in the role of protecting peace in the world and
          championing anti-terrorism. He discovered that Iraq is a terrorist
          country so it must be punished in a similar way as done in Taliban
          Governed Afghanistan. Thus he tried to maneuver the world opinion
          against Saddam governed Iraq depicting it as a terrorist country
          having link with Al Quida and such other organizations.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I
          remember today, 25<sup>th</sup> March, the horrible nightmare we
          witnessed in Dhaka with the rest of the country when the Pakistani
          army numbering at least one division equipped with tanks, rocket
          launchers, howitzer and most sophisticated weapons fell on the
          sleeping population of Dhaka at the dark night. I find a close
          similarity between the actions of Pakistani Military Junta led by
          General Yahya and the warmongers of USA led by president Bush. Both
          acted against humanity; both declared war on innocent people ignoring
          and flouting the world opinion. General Yahya declared war against an
          unarmed people, whereas on the other hand junior Bush thrust a war on
          a week nation. In comparison to the power &amp; effectiveness of
          allied force, Iraq is just a pigmy, a helpless entity. The only fault
          of Iraq is that a dictator called Saddam is ruling it. But there are
          so many dictators in so many countries where there is no semblance of
          democratic institution reflecting the opinion of the people, it never
          occurred to me that for this very reason a supreme power could take
          military action against one such country ignoring UNO and flouting
          world opinion and peaceful method. But what is the fault of Iraq ?</p>

          it is probably the weakest nation. Yes Saddam had committed many
          crimes against his people and possibly his terrorism new no bounds.
          But all these were confined within his country. We did not know Saddam
          ever exported terrorism to outside world least in USA. He had never
          known to have trained Palestinians and exported them to Israel. Even
          his worst enemy can charge him with remotest possibility of his
          connection with notorious 11<sup>th</sup> September incident. An
          international terrorist group, Al Queda, with its hundred of centers

          Saddam is an autocratic ruler, and his country has no democracy or a

          there are so many countries particularly in Arab and Muslim Countries
