    <p>America is under attack as never before -- not only from terrorists but
    also from people who provide a justification for terrorism. Islamic
    fundamentalists declare America the Great Satan. Europeans rail against
    American capitalism and American culture. South American activists denounce
    the United States for &quot;neocolonialism&quot; and oppression.</p>
    <p>Anti-Americanism from abroad would not be such a problem if Americans
    were united in standing up for their own country. But in this country
    itself, there are those who blame America for most of the evils in the
    world. On the political left, many fault the United States for a history of
    slavery, and for continuing inequality and racism. Even on the right,
    traditionally the home of patriotism, we hear influential figures say that
    America has become so decadent that we are &quot;slouching towards
    Gomorrah.&quot;
    <p>If these critics are right, then America should be destroyed. And who can
    dispute some of their particulars? This country did have a history of
    slavery and racism continues to exist. There is much in our culture that is
    vulgar and decadent. But the critics are wrong about America, because they
    are missing the big picture. In their indignation over the sins of America,
    they ignore what is unique and good about American civilization.
    <p>As an immigrant who has chosen to become an American citizen, I feel
    especially qualified to say what is special about America. Having grown up
    in a different society -- in my case, Bombay, India -- I am not only able to
    identify aspects of America that are invisible to the natives, but I am
    acutely conscious of the daily blessings that I enjoy in America. Here,
    then, is my list of the 10 great things about America.
    <p>-- <strong>America provides an amazingly good life for the ordinary guy</strong>.
    Rich people live well everywhere. But what distinguishes America is that it
    provides an impressively high standard of living for the &quot;common
    man.&quot; We now live in a country where construction workers regularly pay
    $4 for a nonfat latte, where maids drive nice cars and where plumbers take
    their families on vacation to Europe.
    <p>Indeed, newcomers to the United States are struck by the amenities
    enjoyed by &quot;poor&quot; people. This fact was dramatized in the 1980s
    when CBS television broadcast a documentary, &quot;People Like Us,&quot;
    intended to show the miseries of the poor during an ongoing recession. The
    Soviet Union also broadcast the documentary, with a view to embarrassing the
    Reagan administration. But by the testimony of former Soviet leaders, it had
    the opposite effect. Ordinary people across the Soviet Union saw that the
    poorest Americans have TV sets, microwave ovens and cars. They arrived at
    the same perception that I witnessed in an acquaintance of mine from Bombay
    who has been unsuccessfully trying to move to the United States. I asked
    him, &quot;Why are you so eager to come to America?&quot; He replied,
    &quot;I really want to live in a country where the poor people are
    fat.&quot;
    <p>-- <strong>America offers more opportunity and social mobility than any
    other country</strong>, including the countries of Europe. America is the
    only country that has created a population of &quot;self-made tycoons.&quot;
    Only in America could Pierre Omidyar, whose parents are Iranian and who grew
    up in Paris, have started a company like eBay. Only in America could Vinod
    Khosla, the son of an Indian army officer, become a leading venture
    capitalist, the shaper of the technology industry, and a billionaire to
    boot. Admittedly tycoons are not typical, but no country has created a
    better ladder than America for people to ascend from modest circumstances to
    success.
    <p>-- <strong>Work and trade are respectable in America</strong>.
    Historically most cultures have despised the merchant and the laborer,
    regarding the former as vile and corrupt and the latter as degraded and
    vulgar. Some cultures, such as that of ancient Greece and medieval Islam,
    even held that it is better to acquire things through plunder than through
    trade or contract labor. But the American founders altered this moral
    hierarchy. They established a society in which the life of the businessman,
    and of the people who worked for him, would be a noble calling. In the
    American view, there is nothing vile or degraded about serving your
    customers either as a CEO or as a waiter. The ordinary life of production
    and supporting a family is more highly valued in the United States than in
    any other country. America is the only country in the world where we call
    the waiter &quot;sir,&quot; as if he were a knight.
    <p>-- <strong>America has achieved greater social equality than any other
    society</strong>. True, there are large inequalities of income and wealth in
    America. In purely economic terms, Europe is more egalitarian. But Americans
    are socially more equal than any other people, and this is unaffected by
    economic disparities. Alexis de Tocqueville noticed this egalitarianism a
    century and a half ago and it is, if anything, more prevalent today. For all
    his riches, Bill Gates could not approach the typical American and say,
    &quot;Here's a $100 bill. I'll give it to you if you kiss my feet.&quot;
    Most likely, the person would tell Gates to go to hell! The American view is
    that the rich guy may have more money, but he isn't in any fundamental sense
    better than anyone else.
    <p>-- <strong>People live longer, fuller lives in America</strong>. Although
    protesters rail against the American version of technological capitalism at
    trade meetings around the world, in reality the American system has given
    citizens many more years of life, and the means to live more intensely and
    actively. In 1900, the life expectancy in America was around 50 years;
    today, it is more than 75 years. Advances in medicine and agriculture are
    mainly responsible for the change. This extension of the life span means
    more years to enjoy life, more free time to devote to a good cause, and more
    occasions to do things with the grandchildren. In many countries, people who
    are old seem to have nothing to do: they just wait to die. In America the
    old are incredibly vigorous, and people in their seventies pursue the
    pleasures of life, including remarriage and sexual gratification, with a
    zeal that I find unnerving.
    <p>-- <strong>In America the destiny of the young is not given to them, but
    created by them</strong>. Not long ago, I asked myself, &quot;What would my
    life have been like if I had never come to the United States?&quot; If I had
    remained in India, I would probably have lived my whole life within a
    five-mile radius of where I was born. I would undoubtedly have married a
    woman of my identical religious and socioeconomic background. I would almost
    certainly have become a medical doctor, or an engineer, or a computer
    programmer. I would have socialized entirely within my ethic community. I
    would have a whole set of opinions that could be predicted in advance;
    indeed, they would not be very different from what my father believed, or
    his father before him. In sum, my destiny would to a large degree have been
    given to me.
    <p>In America, I have seen my life take a radically different course. In
    college I became interested in literature and politics, and I resolved to
    make a career as a writer. I married a woman whose ancestry is English,
    French, Scotch-Irish, German and American Indian. In my twenties I found
    myself working as a policy analyst in the White House, even though I was not
    an American citizen. No other country, I am sure, would have permitted a
    foreigner to work in its inner citadel of government.
    <p>In most countries in the world, your fate and your identity are handed to
    you; in America, you determine them for yourself. America is a country where
    you get to write the script of your own life. Your life is like a blank
    sheet of paper, and you are the artist. This notion of being the architect
    of your own destiny is the incredibly powerful idea that is behind the
    worldwide appeal of America. Young people especially find irresistible the
    prospect of authoring the narrative of their own lives.
    <p>-- <strong>America has gone further than any other society in
    establishing equality of rights.</strong> There is nothing distinctively
    American about slavery or bigotry. Slavery has existed in virtually every
    culture, and xenophobia, prejudice and discrimination are worldwide
    phenomena. Western civilization is the only civilization to mount a
    principled campaign against slavery; no country expended more treasure and
    blood to get rid of slavery than the United States. While racism remains a
    problem, this country has made strenuous efforts to eradicate
    discrimination, even to the extent of enacting policies that give legal
    preference in university admissions, jobs, and government contracts to
    members of minority groups. Such policies remain controversial, but the
    point is that it is extremely unlikely that a racist society would have
    permitted such policies in the first place. And surely African Americans
    like Jesse Jackson are vastly better off living in America than they would
    be if they were to live in, say, Ethiopia or Somalia.
    <p>-- <strong>America has found a solution to the problem of religious and
    ethnic conflict that continues to divide and terrorize much of the world</strong>.
    Visitors to places like New York are amazed to see the way in which Serbs
    and Croatians, Sikhs and Hindus, Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants, Jews
    and Palestinians,
    <p>all seem to work and live together in harmony. How is this possible when
    these same groups are spearing each other and burning each other's homes in
    so many places in the world?
    <p>The American answer is twofold. First, separate the spheres of religion
    and government so that no religion is given official preference but all are
    free to practice their faith as they wish. Second, do not extend rights to
    racial or ethnic groups but only to individuals; in this way, all are equal
    in the eyes of the law, opportunity is open to anyone who can take advantage
    of it, and everybody who embraces the American way of life can &quot;become
    American.&quot;
    <p>Of course there are exceptions to these core principles, even in America.
    Racial preferences are one such exception, which explains why they are
    controversial. But in general, America is the only country in the world that
    extends full membership to outsiders. The typical American could come to
    India,
    <p>live for 40 years, and take Indian citizenship. But he could not
    &quot;become Indian.&quot; He wouldn't see himself that way, nor would most
    Indians see him that way. In America, by contrast, hundreds of millions have
    come from far-flung shores and over time they, or at least their children,
    have in a profound and full sense &quot;become American.&quot;
    <p>-- <strong>America has the kindest, gentlest foreign policy of any great
    power in world history</strong>. Critics of the United States are likely to
    react to this truth with sputtering outrage. They will point to
    long-standing American support for a Latin or Middle Eastern despot, or the
    unjust internment of the Japanese during World War II, or America's
    reluctance to impose sanctions on South Africa's apartheid regime. However
    one feels about these particular cases, let us concede to the critics the
    point that America is not always in the right.
    <p>What the critics leave out is the other side of the ledger. Twice in the
    20th century, the United States saved the world -- first from the Nazi
    threat, then from Soviet totalitarianism. What would have been the world's
    fate if America had not existed? After destroying Germany and Japan in World
    War II, the United States proceeded to rebuild both countries, and today
    they are American allies. Now we are doing the same thing in Afghanistan and
    Iraq. Consider, too, how magnanimous the United States has been to the
    former Soviet Union after its victory in the Cold War. For the most part
    America is an abstaining superpower; it shows no real interest in conquering
    and subjugating the rest of the world. (Imagine how the Soviets would have
    acted if they had won the Cold War.) On occasion the United States
    intervenes to overthrow a tyrannical regime or to halt massive human rights
    abuses in another country, but it never stays to rule that country. In
    Grenada, Haiti and Bosnia, the United States got in and then it got out.
    Moreover, when America does get into a war, as in Iraq, its troops are
    supremely careful to avoid targeting civilians and to minimize collateral
    damage. Even as America bombed the Taliban infrastructure and hideouts, U.S.
    planes dropped food to avert hardship and starvation of Afghan civilians.
    What other country does these things?
    <p>-- <strong>America, the freest nation on Earth</strong>, is also the most
    virtuous nation on Earth. This point seems counterintuitive, given the
    amount of conspicuous vulgarity, vice and immorality in America. Some
    Islamic fundamentalists argue that their regimes are morally superior to the
    United States because they seek to foster virtue among the citizens. Virtue,
    these fundamentalists argue, is a higher principle than liberty.
    <p>Indeed it is. And let us admit that in a free society, freedom will
    frequently be used badly. Freedom, by definition, includes the freedom to do
    good or evil, to act nobly or basely. But if freedom brings out the worst in
    people, it also brings out the best. The millions of Americans who live
    decent,
    <p>praiseworthy lives desire our highest admiration because they have opted
    for the good when the good is not the only available option. Even amid the
    temptations of a rich and free society, they have remained on the straight
    path. Their virtue has special luster because it is freely chosen.
    <p>By contrast, the societies that many Islamic fundamentalists seek would
    eliminate the possibility of virtue. If the supply of virtue is insufficient
    in a free society like America, it is almost nonexistent in an unfree
    society like Iran's. The reason is that coerced virtues are not virtues at
    all. Consider the woman who is required to wear a veil. There is no modesty
    in this,
    <p>because she is being compelled. Compulsion cannot produce virtue, it can
    only produce the outward semblance of virtue. Thus a free society like
    America's is not merely more prosperous, more varied, more peaceful, and
    more tolerant -- it is also morally superior to the theocratic and
    authoritarian regimes that America's enemies advocate.
    <p>&quot;To make us love our country,&quot; Edmund Burke once said,
    &quot;our country ought to be lovely.&quot; Burke's point is that we should
    love our country not just because it is ours, but also because it is good.
    America is far from perfect, and there is lots of room for improvement. In
    spite of its flaws, however, American life as it is lived today is the best
    life that our world has to offer. Ultimately America is worthy of our love
    and sacrifice because, more than any other society, it makes possible the
