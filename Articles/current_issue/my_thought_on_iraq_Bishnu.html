          <p>I do not know why this war with Iraq is one I cannot come to grips
          with! Why do I not feel happy, the way I did when the Taliban regime
          in Afghanistan was being pounded? There was immense joy in watching
          the Taliban mullahs being hog-tied and huddled in cages, where they
          indeed deserved to be! This time around, I watch the TV and see the
          flashes of the cruise missiles and the bunker-busters and with each
          strike I grimace. I feel a pain at the sight of the regal buildings
          being shattered into rock and dust. I look at those broad highways
          that crisscross Baghdad and deep inside I used to feel a tinge of envy
          when I compared those with the city of Kolkata, where I spent a part
          of my early life. But now, all are in shambles and as I hear the
          screams of those haunted residents of Baghdad and feel a strange
          empathy for those huddled masses, who are indeed paying a horrible
          price for crimes perpetrated by their leaders.</p>
          <p>This war is not a clash of civilizations as some might wish to
          portray. To me, this war is the epitome of the degradation of human
          virtues. It is also beginning of a prolonged struggle for all of us to
          re-examine our values. Have we all become so desensitized that we
          accept everything like a horde of cattle being huddled to the
          slaughterhouse? Where is the outrage, where is the cry of shame? When
          shall we all be able to stand up to this mindless destruction and say
          enough is enough?</p>
          <p>I am afraid and I am torn apart. I am struggling to convince myself
          that in the end the sun will shine and bring happiness and peace to
          all. I strive to ignore the actions of my government against the Iraqi
          regime. <b>Even as I readily concede that Saddam Hussein is a despot
          and a cold blooded murderer, I still can't convince myself that these
          actions justify the untold sufferings that is wrought upon the people
          of Iraq. I see the pictures of the suffering people and the children
          and try to imagine what would I have felt if I were in their place?</b>
          How would I cope with the torments that the nighttimes bring
          endlessly? I think of the little children and I feel their anguish, I
          sense their fear, and I imagine their horror with every
          &quot;successful&quot; strike of the &quot;precision&quot; bomb. What
          would I have done, if I were there??</p>
          <p>I am a citizen of a free nation and I am also a proud citizen of
          this wonderful country, which I chose to be my adopted motherland. I
          breathed the air upon arrival to this land many years ago and heaved a
          sigh of relief; at last I am free! I am free! I was glad to escape
          from the clutches of the oppressive political system in India run by
          the Congress mafia, which offered nothing but corruption, despair and
          pain to its thriving mass of uncounted millions. I was lucky, so I
          thought when I set foot upon the land of the free and the home of the
          brave! Home of the brave, yes - but land of the free? I don't know. I
          am so confused!</p>
          <p>I love this country, I love the wonderful people, but I am also
          saddened that 70% of the people feel that the war is justified. I know
          how caring the people of this land are, and how much they feel for the
          sanctity of human lives! But, I am saddened to see the apathy and the
          general sense of complacency in their display of nationalism at the
          expense of humanism. Perhaps they are afraid to speak out, perhaps
          they are apprehensive of letting their feelings known, and perhaps
          they are like me fearful of being branded as unpatriotic, should they
          voice their opinion against this mindless war. This war has torn me;
          this war has shaken me apart.</p>
          <p>Little did I imagine that all hopes, aspirations and the
          tranquility of the 21st century would soon come to a crushing halt as
          I remained transfixed to the tube, watching the twin towers of human
          civilization go down in a rubble of smoke and dust, the fateful
          morning of 9/11. The perpetrators of that horrible crime probably
          envisioned this outcome and much worse, but did they really care for
          the untold misery that their brutal actions would unfurl? The hate,
          the rage, and the lack of compassion implanted and deeply embedded
          into the minds of individuals through the masterful interpretation of
          so-called words of Allah, is what opened the floodgates of this
          calamity that we are all confronted with.</p>
          <p><b>No, all Muslims are not terrorists, nor are they deserving of
          the scorn and suspicion that many are subjected to. In fact, the
          Muslims are the biggest victims of the scourge that befall upon them.
          This is what happens when religion is used as a tool of governance and
          when people fail to perceive the hidden dangers in allowing the clergy
          to decide the course of nations.</b> I wonder, how a mass of humanity
          comprising of a billion plus individuals be so easily be brainwashed
          by the Kazis, Mullahs, and Imams to accept such degrading, hateful,
          and intolerant teachings to be the words of God! Wouldn't the
          believers of Allah now wish that he came down from his heavenly abode
          riding the timeless &quot;Jibrail&quot; to defend the hapless children
          of Iraq? Why doesn't he? What prevents him from saving his devoted
          children who go to sleep and wake up every morning chanting
          &quot;Allah Hu Akbar&quot;, from the suffering inflicted by the
          &quot;Great Satan&quot;?</p>
          <p>This opium of religion is what has brought this scourge upon us
          all. No one is left unaffected by this war; we are all victims. Some
          justify this as an act of self-defense; others shy away from taking a
          stand. I however, feel ashamed that there aren't enough sensible souls
          in this planet who could stand up and say, let's work together and
          solve our problems in a manner befitting of human dignity.
          Unfortunately, the onus of this falls squarely on the shoulders of the
          Muslims of the world. They have to stand up against their own clergy
          and uproot them from their lofty perches. The world needs to see the
          victims collectively voice their outrage against these fundamentalist
          despots and they will no longer stand by and let these vicious,
          ignorant barbarians dictate human values to them, while disregarding
          all norms of civilized life in their pursuit of holy jihad against the
          &quot;kuffirs&quot;, with their one track pursuit of geo-political
          supremacy.</p>
          <p>In the end, I know that my country will be victorious in this
          endeavor, but this be very costly and there is a hefty price that will
          accompany this victory. The world is indeed &quot;shocked and
          awed&quot; by the display of might and superiority of our airpower and
          technology, but at the same time there will be a chilling effect on
          the rest of the world as to what this triumph really establishes. Is
          this the &quot;new world order&quot; that we all talked about at the
          turn of the last century following the demise of the Soviet empire? I
          am afraid that now in the eyes of many my country will not appear as a
          beacon of civility, nor will be perceived as a champion of freedom;
          rather a bully whose mantra is &quot;my way, or no way&quot;!</p>
          <p>In ending, I would like to state unequivocally that I am in full
          support of the lead my country has taken in eradicating this world of
          the scourge of Islamic fanaticism. I also support my country's drive
          in removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. I hope that this war is
          over soon, and the young soldiers of this land, many of them mere
          teenagers, return home safely to be with their family and loved ones.
          I salute them for undertaking the heavy burden of this awesome
          responsibility. I also hope and pray that the people of Iraq are able
          to overcome this suffering. If there is a God, may his presence save
          the lives of the innocent Iraqis.</p>
