	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0pt" align="justify">
		&nbsp;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Where am I? I am certain no one will 
	believe me if I say I have no answer to this apparently straightforward 
	question, but the truth is I just do not know. And if I were to be asked how 
	I am, I would again answer: I don’t know. I am like the living dead: 
	benumbed; robbed of the pleasure of existence and experience; unable to move 
	beyond the claustrophobic confines of my room. Day and night, night and day. 
	Yes, this is how I have been surviving. This nightmare did not begin when I 
	was suddenly bundled out of Calcutta—it has been going on for a while. It is 
	like a slow and lingering death, like sipping delicately from a cupful of 
	slow-acting poison that is gradually killing all my faculties. This is a 
	conspiracy to murder my essence, my being, once so courageous, so brave, so 
	dynamic, so playful. I realise what is going on around me but am utterly 
	helpless, despite my best efforts, to wage a battle on my own behalf. I am 
	merely a disembodied voice. Those who once stood by me have disappeared into 
	the darkness. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I ask myself: what heinous crime 
	have I committed? What sort of life is this where I can neither cross my own 
	threshold nor know the joys of human company? What crime have I committed 
	that I have to spend my life hidden away, relegated to the shadows? For what 
	crimes am I being punished by this society, this land? I wrote of my beliefs 
	and my convictions. I used words, not violence, to express my ideas. I did 
	not take recourse to pelting stones or bloodshed to make my point. Yet, I am 
	considered a criminal. I am being persecuted because it was felt that the 
	right of others to express their opinions was more legitimate than mine.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Does India not realise how immense 
	the suffering must be for an individual to renounce her most deeply-held 
	beliefs? How humiliated, frightened, and insecure I must have been to allow 
	my words to be censored. If I had not agreed to the grotesque bowdlerisation 
	of my writings by those who insisted on it, I would have been hounded and 
	pursued till I dropped dead. Their politics, their faith, their barbarism, 
	and their diabolical purposes are all intent on sucking the lifeblood out of 
	me, because the truths I write are so difficult for them to stomach. How can 
	I—a powerless and unprotected individual—battle brute force? But come what 
	may, I cannot take recourse to untruth. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What have I to offer but love and 
	compassion? In the way that they used hatred to rip out my words, I would 
	like to use compassion and love to rip the hatred out of them. Certainly, I 
	am enough of a realist to acknowledge that strife, hatred, cruelty and 
	barbarism are integral elements of the human condition. This will not 
	change; and how can an insignificant creature like me change all this? If I 
	were to be eradicated or exterminated, it would not matter one whit to the 
	world at large. I know all this. Yet, I had imagined Bengal would be 
	different. I had thought the madness of her people was temporary. I had 
	thought that the Bengal I loved so passionately would never forsake me. She 
	did. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Exiled from Bangladesh, I wandered 
	around the world for many years like a lost orphan. The moment I was given 
	shelter in West Bengal, it felt as though all those years of numbing 
	tiredness just melted away. I was able to resume a normal life in a beloved 
	and familiar land. So long as I survive, I will carry within me the vistas 
	of Bengal, her sunshine, her wet earth, her very essence. The same Bengal 
	whose sanctuary I once walked many blood-soaked miles to reach has now 
	turned its back upon me. I am a Bengali within and without; I live, breathe, 
	and dream in Bengali. I find it hard to believe that I am no longer wanted 
	in Bengal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am a guest in this land, I must be 
	careful of what I say. I must do nothing that violates the code of 
	hospitality. I did not come here to hurt anyone’s sentiments or feelings. 
	Wounded and hurt in my own country, I suffered slights and injuries in many 
	lands before I reached India, where I knew I would be hurt yet again. For 
	this is, after all, a democratic and secular land where the politics of the 
	vote bank imply that being secular is equated with being pro-Muslim 
	fundamentalist. I do not wish to believe all this. I do not wish to hear all 
	this. Yet, all around me I read, hear, and see evidence of this. I sometimes 
	wish I could be like those mythical monkeys, oblivious to all the evil that 
	is going on around me. Death who visits me in many forms now feels like a 
	friend. I feel like talking to him, unburdening myself to him. I have no one 
	else to speak to, no one else to whom I can unburden myself. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have lost my beloved Bengal. No 
	child torn from its mother’s breast could have suffered as much as I did 
	during that painful parting. Once again, I have lost the mother from whose 
	womb I was born. The pain is no less than the day I lost my biological 
	mother. My mother had always wanted me to return home. That was something I 
	could not do. After settling down in Calcutta, I was able to tell my mother, 
	who by then was a memory within me that I had indeed returned home. How did 
	it matter which side of an artificial divide I was on? Now, I do not have 
	the courage to tell my mother that I have been unceremoniously expelled by 
	those who had once given me shelter, that my life now is that of a nomad. My 
	sensitive mother would be shattered if I were to tell her all this. Instead, 
	I have now taken to convincing myself that I must have transgressed 
	somewhere, committed some grievous error. Why else would I be in such a 
	situation? Is daring to utter the truth a terrible sin in this era of 
	falsehood and deceit? Is it because I am a woman? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I know I have not been condemned by 
	the masses. If their opinion had been sought, I am certain the majority 
	would have wanted me to stay on in Bengal. But when has a democracy 
	reflected the voice of the masses? A democracy is run by those who hold the 
	reins of power, who do exactly what they think fit. An insignificant 
	individual, I must now live life on my own terms and write about what I 
	believe in and hold dear. It is not my desire to harm, malign, or deceive. I 
	do not lie. I try not to be offensive. I am but a simple writer who neither 
	knows nor understands the dynamics of politics. The way in which I was 
	turned into a political pawn, however, and treated at the hands of base 
	politicians, beggars belief. For what end, you may well ask. A few measly 
	votes. The force of fundamentalism, which I have opposed and fought for many 
	years, has only been strengthened by my defeat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is my beloved India, where I 
	have been living and writing on secular humanism, human rights and 
	emancipation of women. This is also the land where I have had to suffer and 
	pay the price for my most deeply held and fundamental convictions, where not 
	a single political party of any persuasion has spoken out in my favour, 
	where no non-governmental organisation, women’s rights or human rights group 
	has stood by me or condemned the vicious attacks launched upon me. This is 
	an India I have never before known. Yes, it is true that individuals in a 
	scattered, unorganised manner are fighting for my cause, and journalists, 
	writers, and intellectuals have spoken out in my favour, even if they have 
	never read a word I have written. Yet, I am grateful for their opinions and 
	support. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Wherever individuals gather in 
	groups, they seem to lose their power to speak out. Frankly, this facet of 
	the new India terrifies me. Then again, is this a new India, or is it the 
	true face of the nation? I do not know. Since my earliest childhood I have 
	regarded India as a great land and a fearless nation. The land of my dreams: 
	enlightened, strong, progressive, and tolerant. I want to be proud of that 
	India. I will die a happy person the day I know India has forsaken darkness 
	for light, bigotry for tolerance. I await that day. I do not know whether I 
	will survive, but India and what she stands for has to survive. </font></p>
