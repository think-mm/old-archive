	July 04, 2004</font></b></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ms. Setara Hashem wrote a desultory 
	write-up in response to my earlier essay. In my essay, I focused on the need 
	for investigating the teachings of Islam that create obstacles in the 
	progress of any ism (socialism, capitalism, or any mixed system). <b>Ms. 
	Setara Hashem quite unnecessarily wrote on irrelevant issues while rebutting 
	my essay. She even attacked me personally.</b> According to her, I am under 
	hallucination like other Bangladesh-origin freethinkers/secularists. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As it appears to me, “she” thinks 
	anyone who does not agree with her is under hallucination. What a 
	generalization! In my essay, I didn't write anything to attack her 
	personally. I placed my point of views with my arguments. I only expected 
	“her” arguments to rebut my essay. But, “she” chose to use derogatory words 
	to undermine my knowledge and analytical abilities. “She” even suggested &quot;to 
	understand social conflict and has to gather knowledge regarding reasons of 
	present conflict and to identify the people.&quot; Regarding “her” knowledge, Mr. 
	Jahed Ahmed showed her areas of deficiency. I thank Mr. Jahed Ahmed to give 
	“her” some well-referenced data and information. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hope “she” has understood “her” 
	mistakes and lack of knowledge on the information that she communicated 
	based on her wrong ideas. It's never late to correct oneself and it's also 
	never late to learn something new. In this respect, Mr. Jahed Ahmed has done 
	a mighty fine job to educate “her.” But I am doubtful whether Setara Hashem 
	would ever learn anything from anyone in the e-forum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In her writing, she criticized USA. 
	I wrote that there are many conscious citizens in USA, who would fearlessly 
	criticize the foreign policy of their governments if necessary. I also 
	believe that there are many democratic institutions in USA, which will help 
	correct the mistakes of their government eventually. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are many freethinkers in USA, 
	who can write fearlessly against any religious doctrine that can cause 
	sufferings to their people. But, in a Muslim dominated country such as 
	Bangladesh, there aren't many people who can come forward to criticize the 
	cruelties of the dominant religion called Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ms. Setara Hashem prefers not to 
	criticize Islam even though its teachings/practices allow capturing state 
	power and impose barbaric Sha’ria laws. I hope Ms. Setara Hashem understands 
	that the barbaric Sha’ria laws are basically Islamic laws. I'm sure that the 
	freethinkers of Bangladesh (and the world) will stand against these barbaric 
	laws. They'll certainly scrutinize the teachings of Islam that creates 
	Maulanas who try to implement these age-old and barbaric Islamic laws.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ms Hashem wrote: &quot;A man, who rebuts 
	or bashes religion or Islam, cannot be a secularist.&quot; If the 
	Bangladesh-origin freethinkers are labeled as bashers for criticizing the 
	barbaric laws of Islam, then I think there will be more and more bashers 
	until the Islamists modify/rectify their barbaric laws. Ms. Hashem should 
	know that Bertrand Russell, Einstein, et al. criticized the core beliefs 
	based on a personal God. Were they bashers of Judaism or Christianity? In 
	fact, these are the people who helped the progress of civilization and 
	humanity by criticizing the superstitious belief system. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Ms. Hashem, thousands 
	of Madrassah-educated people fought against Pakistani Islamists during 1971. 
	It's such a ridiculous claim that there is no need for me to even write 
	anything on it. Only a dunce may say such a thing! The independence war 
	against Pakistan was portrayed by most of the Maulanas as a ploy to destroy 
	both Islam and Pakistan. How can I forget about such lectures of Imams after 
	Friday prayers in 1971? I'm not writing anything from any fictitious ideas. 
	I'm writing from my own experiences. It's not only my own experience. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I suggest Ms. Hashem to read about 
	the experiences of Dr. Humayun Ahmed (novelist) on the role of Maulanas in 
	1971 (reference: Shadhinotar Bish Bochor Por (Twenty Years after the 
	Independence), published probably in 1992). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On top-down policy, I didn't mean to 
	impose anything by force. I meant that the intellectuals and politicians 
	around Bangabandhu realized the need for the separation of politics/state 
	from religion long before the common mass realized about it. They considered 
	secularism as one of the major principles for the progress of Bangladesh in 
	1971. They didn't try to impose it rather they constantly tried to convince 
	the people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The role of the Islamic political 
	parties in conducting genocide in 1971 made it a necessity to ban their 
	vicious Islamic politics. After independence, the Bangalees rightfully 
	identified the political Islamists as the vicious communal forces. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The majority accepted the banning of 
	the Islamic communalists because Bangabandhu got the mandate in the election 
	held in March 1973. Unfortunately, the political Islamists didn't give up 
	their dream to make Bangladesh an Islamic Republic a la Pakistan. They 
	continued their vicious propaganda against secularism in religious 
	gatherings. Ms. Hashem wants to regulate them. How can she regulate them? 
	They get inspiration from their scriptures to regulate all including her and 
	anyone else. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Mullahs think that they've the 
	authority based on their scriptures to veil Ms. Hashem and others like her 
	under a mobile prison called Burqah. They can give authority to her husband, 
	if she has one, to beat her if she repeatedly disobeys him. Judging from her 
	attitude, she might disobey her husband! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Mullahs could stone her to death 
	if she lays her eyes on another man and fall in love in the process. If her 
	husband gives divorce at some point of time, they won't let her come back to 
	her dear husband without undergoing a hilla marriage (an intermediate form 
	of marriage, which needs to be consummated). They won't let her drive. They 
	won't even let her go out alone. Please don't take me amiss. Please don't 
	take anything personally. I just wanted to show how cruel the Islamic rules 
	are for a woman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The rules are also cruel for anyone 
	who has some analytical abilities. They'll kill if they declare anyone as a 
	Murtaad (apostate). The Maulanas are the ones who give Fatwas to kill. They 
	issue Fatwas citing the verses of their Holy Scriptures. I'm sure she (Setara) 
	read the recent Fatwa against Professor Muntasir Mamun and two other 
	professors issued by none other than a group of Maulanas. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If they succeed in capturing power, 
	then their Fatwas will become the state laws. They'll be the judges, jury 
	and all. Of course, they'll read the verses from the scriptures while 
	issuing the verdict for amputation, hilla marriage, beheading, and whatnot 
	for silly reasons. Before that happens, we must look into the scriptures and 
	disseminate the information to make the current and future generations aware 
	of the vicious rules and the pernicious forces of political Islam. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I always thank and appreciate those 
	who have come forward to expose the hidden face of political Islam. I don't 
	think Ms. Hashem has proper knowledge on this vicious philosophy of Islam 
	even though she masquerades as a know-it-all pundit. But her knowledge seems 
	to be confined to leaflet-based materials on Marxism, Stalinism, Maoism, 
	etc. I would request her to read and understand before she gives unnecessary 
	advices/suggestions to others. She wants to be “Dear Abbey” amongst 
	Bengalis. I would also like to inform her that I wouldn't debate again with 
	her for her sophistry on irrelevant issues. I would rather not listen to her 
	stentorian voice. All her cacophony must stop in the Net! </font>
