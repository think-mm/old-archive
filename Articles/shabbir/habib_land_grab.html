	<p align="justify"><br>
	<font face="Verdana">In Bangladesh, the history of land grabbing date back 
	to the period under British Raj. At that time, most of the land grabbing 
	used to be carried out by the Zamindars in the village areas. They used to 
	maintain pet armed forces, most likely lathial, to carry out the land 
	grabbing acts.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There were instances when the forces 
	of the Zamindars attacked and evicted small property owners from their homes 
	in the dark of the night by force. Later, the Zamindars registered the lands 
	in their names using their influences and installed one of their subjects on 
	the property. After the abolition of Zamindari System through East Bengal 
	State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1950), the people in the village areas 
	were freed from the tyranny of these high-class land grabbers.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, especially, in towns and 
	cities, a new breed of land grabbers gradually emerged under the influence 
	of different godfathers, who could exert their political/economic influence 
	upon the weak and docile law enforcement agencies of the government. Most of 
	the godfathers themselves are the land grabbers. Recently, we came to know a 
	case of land grabbing in Chittagong through different media. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This case needs some analysis 
	because the victim is an expatriate Bengali named &quot;Mr. Habib Siddique,&quot; who 
	was very sensitive and reactive on any such negative issues (in Bangladesh) 
	raised by others. In particular, like many others of his kind, he was 
	concerned about the image of Bangladesh not too long ago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is indeed a bad news for him 
	because he has gained painful experience after losing his paternal 
	properties to the notorious land-grabbers of Chittagong. The story of this 
	high-profile land grabbing was published in a weekly newspaper called &quot;Thikana&quot; 
	(published in New York, USA) maybe a couple of months or so ago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I became curious to read after 
	seeing the name of Mr. Habib Siddique, a writer actively involved in 
	protecting the image of Bangladesh as a tolerant Muslim country. I read a 
	part of his recent interview published in News from Bangladesh. He mentioned 
	in his interview about the total worth of his family property. It is about 
	ninety crore real estate. Mr. Siddique did not disclose the source of such a 
	huge amount of the real estate in Chittagong. Anyone can guess anything 
	until Mr. Siddique reveals the source of such an exorbitant amount of (real 
	estate) wealth his family was able to retain after maintaining all sorts of 
	the expenditure in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As indicated in Mr. Siddique's 
	interview, the land grabber of his property is the son of a powerful 
	&quot;Politician.&quot; He did not mention the name of the &quot;Politician&quot; even though he 
	met with him. He mentioned all other names but he refrained from mentioning 
	the name of the &quot;Politician.&quot; I think Mr. Siddique is afraid of even 
	mentioning the name of the &quot;Politician.&quot; What a cowardly approach from an 
	outspoken writer like Mr. Siddique? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I remember his outspoken rhetoric 
	against the writers (in Mukto-Mona and other forums), who used to criticize 
	the goons of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-i-Islami for 
	their heinous attacks including killing, land grabbing, raping, etc. against 
	minorities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, he wrote voluminous 
	articles to counter the criticism of the liberal-freethinking writers 
	against the fundamentalist goons of BNP and Jamaat-I-Islami. In a letter to 
	then moderator Mr. Rahul Gupta of Mukto-Mona, he wrote on the killing of 
	Hindu priest Mr. Goswami as: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;As to making a big fuss about 
		Hindu priest Goswami's murder (in Mayer Dak), I think it is an ignoble, 
		criminal and politically biased propaganda to blame all such murders to 
		a process of ethnic cleansing. Bangladesh never had and still does not 
		have such a policy.&quot; (<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/ethnic_clensing_Bangladesh.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/ethnic_clensing_Bangladesh.html</a>)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	<br>
	In the above link, Mr. Rahul Gupta mentioned only some of the incidences of 
	torture. Nevertheless, in the same link, the reaction of Mr. Siddique can be 
	read at the bottom of Mr. Gupta's short essay. In the aftermath of 2001 
	election, the fundamentalist goons targeted the helpless minorities 
	especially the Hindus. Many killings and rapes were reported in the leading 
	newspapers.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the killing of a Hindu priest 
	was &quot;a big fuss&quot; to Mr. Siddique as he wrote. It is true that the thugs of 
	the fundamentalist alliance targeted the supporters, workers, and leaders of 
	Awami League. However, these thugs specifically targeted the Hindus 
	irrespective of their political affiliation. Even the goons of the 
	fundamentalist alliance raped a Hindu girl who voted for Bangladesh 
	Nationalist Party (BNP) in 2001 election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, a good number of 
	people belonging to the minority community do not understand the communal 
	character of BNP, which started the politics by allowing and integrating the 
	killer Jamaat-i-Islami and other fundamentalist parties. People like Mr. 
	Siddique tried to cover up the incidences of killings, land grabbing, and 
	torturing of minorities just to protect the image of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He also tried to divert the 
	attention of the conscious people by finger-pointing many other incidences 
	against Muslims in other parts of the world especially in India. To defend 
	the crimes and torture unleashed by the goons of BNP and Jamaat on minority, 
	he pointed his finger toward India as follows (in the previous link): </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Much that we deplore, I must 
		also remind the fact that the sad event of targeted harassment during 
		the last election in Bangladesh was no different than what many Indian 
		Muslims had endured and faced during the election times in India. 
		Violence against Muslims was and still is a routine thing so that 
		Muslims vote for a particular party and not others.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/ethnic_clensing_Bangladesh.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/ethnic_clensing_Bangladesh.html</a>)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Siddique deplored the targeted 
	harassment but gave some excuses citing similar incidences in India. Now, 
	concerning Mr. Habib Siddique's land being grabbed by some goons, if someone 
	says that it was no different from what many others endured and faced in 
	Bangladesh and other parts of the world, then how he would have reacted. He 
	surely wants condemnation on what happened to him and to his family 
	unquestionably. Is this not a selfish and hypocritical expectation? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The forum of liberals and 
	freethinkers of Bangladesh named Mukto-Mona took clear stand against the 
	oppression of minorities (killing, land grabbing, harassment, rape, etc.) in 
	Bangladesh under the patronization of the present fundamentalist alliance 
	government of BNP and Jamaat-i-Islami. This forum came under Mr. Siddique's 
	attack as it can be read in &quot;Pakistan Link:&quot;:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pakistanlink.com/Opinion/2005/Jan05/14/09.htm">http://www.pakistanlink.com/Opinion/2005/Jan05/14/09.htm</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He criticized Mr. Jamal Hasan, Dr. 
	Khurshed Alam Chowdhury, and all others in Mukto-Mona. He referred some of 
	the liberal critics as apostates. Maybe with some satire, he called them 
	Muslim neocons. Even he went as far as calling them &quot;house niggers&quot; and 
	&quot;cultural coolies.&quot; He wrote as follows: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Many of these so-called Muslim 
		neocons are actually fulfilling the task of &quot;native intellectuals&quot; (whom 
		I have been calling - house niggers or cultural coolies - in some of my 
		essays posted in the newspapers and Internet) in support of their 
		imperial masters of our age. They are no different than the Rand Robots 
		in ideology, but are more harmful than the latter, because of their 
		namesake and somewhat familiarity with our people.&quot; </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the next paragraph, Mr. Siddique 
	called them traitors and compared them with Mir Zafar et al. as follows:
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;What every student of history 
		knows is that it does not require too many foot soldiers to occupy a 
		land and rule it effectively, as long as there are traitors like Jagat 
		Seth, Umi Chand, Rai Durlabh and Mir Jafar that are willing to betray 
		the masses and work for the colonizer. Muslim neocons are trying to 
		fulfill that historical role. They should be identified and shunned by 
		our people for the harm they bring to our community.&quot; </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To Mr. Siddique, those who point out 
	the root causes of fundamentalism, communalism, etc. in Bangladesh are 
	traitors, cultural coolies, house niggers, etc. In fact, if I am not wrong, 
	Mr. Siddique's land has been grabbed by the &quot;Politician,&quot; who has been doing 
	communal politics using Islamic fundamentalism, fascism, and communalism for 
	a long time in Bangladesh in general and in Chittagong in particular. I 
	think my guess is not wrong but I would not mention the name based on my 
	guess only. Interestingly, the &quot;Politician&quot; in question is now at a higher 
	level in power in the government as indicated by Mr. Siddique. The current 
	fundamentalist alliance government elevated and empowered him next to the 
	level of the present Prime Minister. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Siddique was so anxious for not 
	embarrassing the fundamentalist goons now in power. He exerted all his 
	energy to counter those who critiqued the communal government that empowered 
	the fundamentalists and the communalists (even the land grabbers) of 
	Bangladesh. In the name of protecting the image of Bangladesh, he served the 
	interests of the fundamentalist coalition government. Now, a question to Mr. 
	Siddique. Are his interviews and write-ups in the cyberspace and print media 
	(about the land grabbing involving a powerful &quot;Politician&quot;) increasing the 
	image of Bangladesh? If not, then why is he doing all these? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not disagree on what he is 
	doing but I am trying to expose the hypocrisy in Mr. Habib Siddique. At 
	least, I think, he has learned some lessons at the cost of the crores of 
	takas land property. These acts should be protested without raising any 
	question. He was supposed to raise the protests along with others in the 
	case of repression on minorities without finger pointing toward India and 
	without attacking those who were protesting the criminal acts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Instead, indirectly, he protected 
	the criminals, who may have become the land grabbers of his own property. I 
	hope he will refrain from attacking the protestors in the future based on 
	the lessons he has learned. However, old habits die hard. Therefore, it is 
	difficult to become hopeful about the consistency of the moral stand of 
	people like Mr. Siddique. In all likelihood, when his family will be able to 
	retrieve all the grabbed land, he probably will revert to BNP-Jamaat camp 
	and then worry about the “Image” of Bangladesh. Now his ire is on BNP-Jamaat 
	Administration. But wait, it will be on secularists as soon his family’s 
	nightmare concerning land grabbing is over. The million-dollar question is ­ 
	will he change forever? </font></p>
