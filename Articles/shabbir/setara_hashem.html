  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">The
  progressive people of Bangladesh had a great vision to establish their
  country, which they did in 1971. The proposed nation was supposed to be based
  on the separation of religion and state.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was called
  &quot;secularism&quot; in the context of Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  concept of secularism was accepted by a great majority of the educated
  Bangalees of Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>It's sadly true that the
  overwhelming majority of the people of Bangladesh are too poor to think about
  many different conflicting isms and more importantly what secularism could do
  for a nation such as ours.<span>&nbsp; </span>That's why even a
  progressivism-based system doesn't originate in a bottom-up process there.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>In Bangladesh, the system still develops in a top-down process.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>This won't change until the masses become educated and achieve
  awareness at least to a certain level.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe the top-down
  process is still true in many developed countries all over the globe.<O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">In a
  top-down process, the spirit of secularism was gradually growing in the
  aftermath of the war of independence in 1971 under the leadership of
  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<span>&nbsp; </span>He wasn't a freethinker
  or in an absolute sense, he wasn't a strict secularist.<span>&nbsp; </span>However,
  in a relative sense, he was a great secularist of all times of Bangladesh for
  he tried his best to bring the country into the path of a progressive system
  based on separation of religion and government.<span>&nbsp; </span>If he were
  am ardent secularist, he wouldn't have participated in prayer in the
  parliament building.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, his government wouldn't have
  provided funds to Islamic Foundation or Durga Puja Committee. Despite all the
  shortcomings that Bangabandhu had, I still admire him for starting the process
  of separation of religion from politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>The parliament
  under his leadership banned all the parties based on religion. <O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">The
  Madrassah-educated Mullahs didn't accept wholeheartedly the banning of the
  fundamentalist parties based on secularism in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most
  of the Mullah started preaching against secularism in mosques and other
  religious gatherings.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, the frequency of <i>Waj
  Mehfils</i> (religious gatherings for brainwashing) increased throughout
  Bangladesh during 1972-'75.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Madrassah-educated
  Islamists started a wave of campaign against secularism and secular principle.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>They interpreted secularism as an ism devoid of religion.<span>&nbsp; </span>I
  myself had attended and listened to the fiery speeches of Imams in mosques and
  <i>Waj Mehfils</i> against Bangabandhu and his ideals of secularism.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>The Mullahs didn't stop criticizing only the secularists.<span>&nbsp; </span>According
  to them, the concept of secularism was brought to the surface by the
  left-leaning socialists.<span>&nbsp; </span>The socialist's did not understand
  at the time nor do they understand npw the mindset of the Islam-educated
  Islamists.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Mullahs, however, understood the thought
  process of socialists quite clearly according to the spirit of their
  scriptures.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Mullahs used to call the socialists as
  Kaffirs to show their contempt for communists and socialists<span>&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">Beginning
  from the 1970s, the Madrassah-educated Islamists of Bangladesh destroyed the
  spirit of secularism quite successfully.<span>&nbsp; </span>They did all the
  necessary works based on which the military dictator Ziaur Rahman deleted
  secularism from the constitution of Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>Throughout
  Bangladesh, the Mullahs supported the vile dictator Ziaur Rahman for bringing
  Islamic fundamentalist parties and mixing Islam and politics in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Gen. Zia and his supporters legitimized the entry of Islamists into
  Bangladesh politics by calling it multi-part democracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>And
  democracy it was!<span>&nbsp; </span>General Zia did everything to squash
  democracy in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>No wonder that when he was
  brutally murdered in Chittagong in May 1981, another military General was
  waiting in the wing to take nation to path of Islamism only to safeguard his
  position as a despotic ruler.<span>&nbsp; </span>Muslims hardly believe in
  democracy; they rather would see a vicegerent whom they will call Allahs
  appointed ruler.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">Based on
  the aforementioned brief analysis, we can criticize Islam-educated Mullahs for
  their opposition against secularism.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, again the
  question arises about their education in Madrassahs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don't
  they learn the teachings of Islam during their long educational carriers in
  Madrassahs? We would have criticized a few of the Mullahs (not Islam) if there
  were a handful of them against secularism, democracy, capitalism, socialism,
  etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>To the contrary, we see a great majority of the
  Mullahs against any of the man-made isms.<span>&nbsp; </span>Almost all of the
  Islam-educated Islamists want Allah-made system where Sharia laws based on
  scripture will dominate the lives of all including Muslims, Hindus,
  Christians, Buddhists, et al.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, they don't endorse
  any ism whether capitalism or socialism that is man-made.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
  want Islamism. Period.<span>&nbsp; </span>That's why we call them Islamists.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>All Muslims aren't Islamists.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Sharia-lovers
  fundamentalists/extremists are the Islamists.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">It would
  be a futile attempt to criticize only the Mullahs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rather,
  we should focus on Islamic teachings that make the Mullahs work against any
  ism of this world.<span>&nbsp; </span>A capitalist or a socialist won't be
  able to bring capitalism or socialism in a country where the Islamists are
  preaching on the basis of Islamic teachings.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the
  progress of time, it's now a sort of established notion that secular democracy
  is the basis of progress where different forces can advance the agenda of
  capitalism or socialism or mixed system of economy.<span>&nbsp; </span>But,
  under the threat of the Islamists, no system can be advanced safely.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>So, the influence of the teachings of Islam upon the Islamists should
  be examined thoroughly.<span>&nbsp; </span><O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="EmailStyle15"><font face="verdana">It's a
  matter of regret that many progressive people of Bangladesh don't try to
  recognize the threat of the hateful/political teachings of Islam propagated by
  the fundamentalists.<span>&nbsp; </span>In Vinnomot, a cyber forum for
  Bangalees in the Internet, I read a few of the articles where one Ms. Setara
  Hashem criticized many Bangladesh-origin freethinkers, who correctly focused
  on the threat caused by the sudden rise of Islamic fundamentalism.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>In this respect, I appreciate Avijit Roy, Jahed Ahmed, Dr. Jaffor Ullah,
  and others to make Ms. Setara Hashem understand the need for focusing on the
  Islamists, who are endangering the progress of human civilization in countries
  like Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of these writers originated from
  Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>They've experienced how the Islamists
  suppressed different progressive forces.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Islamists were
  cunning enough to label many secular democrats as communists during the Cold
  War era.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Islamists under different banner supported the
  torture/killings of many progressive people in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ms.
  Setara Hashem doesn't seem to like focusing on the Islamists, who would most
  likely to call her a <i>murtaad </i>or apostate and then mete out the justice
  by annihilating her from this world for supporting man-made ism called
  socialism.<span>&nbsp; </span>This hardly perturbs Ms. Hashems mind.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Oblivious to this threat she appears to be more interested about
  criticizing America for their policy against Iraq and globalism.<span>&nbsp; </span><O>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="verdana">There are many born-citizen
  Americans, who will fearlessly criticize any wrongdoings of their government.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>But, there are a few Muslim-origin and Bangladesh-origin freethinkers
  who have overcome the fear of the Islamists to voice their concern against
  Islamic fanaticism.<span>&nbsp; </span>In doing this, they're investing the
  root causes that promote the spread of fanaticism.<span>&nbsp; </span>By
  attacking the fundamentalists, we will focus only on the effects but by
  attacking the teachings of the fundamentalists, we will focus on the causes.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>It's a blessing that the western powerful countries are learning from
  the mistakes of their past.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many of these countries
  supported the Islamists in the past for various reasons that I will not
  mention in this article.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now, there is a new
  realization about the global growth of Islamism based on the fundamental
  teachings of Islam.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would request Ms. Setara Hashem and
  others like her to use the present global focus against the Islamists to
  progress toward a secular democratic system where the people will decide
  whether they want a capitalist or a socialist or a mixed economic system.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Let the people decide later about the economic system.<span>&nbsp; </span>But,
  let's focus on the threats imposed by growing Islamism and its adherent who
  want to destroy man-made progress of our civilization that took nearly 5,000
  years.<span>&nbsp; </span>Those who are focusing on the root causes of the
  Islamic fundamentalists aren't Islam bashers, as Ms. Setara Hashem would like
  to call them.<span>&nbsp; </span>They're the people with foresight and vision
  full of courage.<span>&nbsp; </span>I admire them all.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because
  of their baggage of experience due to their origin in a Muslim-dominated
  country, they'll obviously focus on the teachings of Islam that is creating
  the fanatic Islamists and hindering the progress in many respects.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>It's also true that globally the Hindu fanatics or peace-loving
  Buddhists aren't dreaming to bring the whole world under their respective
  religion.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it's the Islamists who believe
  in the spread of Sharia-based rule throughout the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>I
  wouldn't mind about their dream if they're non-violent or if I hadn't seen the
  torture of rickshaw-pullers for eating a bun in a hot humid weather during
  Ramadan in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>The government implemented the rule
  (order issued to all government offices and broadcasted in all dailies)
  according to the teachings of Islam proposed by the Islam-educated Mullahs.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>This is one of the many examples I've cited.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  Islamic rules attack individual's freedom and rights in all possible ways.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>For this, the focus on Islam by the freethinkers of Bangladesh deserves
  praise not criticism from a secular socialist (I suppose) like Ms. Setara
  Hashem.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, I don't think she would like to be
  confined under a burqa or to be beaten by a fanatic/Mullah for walking alone
  without accompanied by a male relative in the streets of a city in Bangladesh.</font></p>

  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="verdana">In summary, the progressive folks
  and modernists originating from Bangladesh should not make scathing comments
  against secularists those who are also from the same country.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  secularists are trying their best to come up with ideas that is responsible
  for the growth of worldwide Islamism.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, all the
  progressive force of our motherland should join hands to figure out how quick
  we could halt the progress of Islamism.<span>&nbsp; </span>We just saw how a
  lone Islamist by the name Bangla Bhai had wreaked havoc in the western and
  southwestern part of Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>That should give Ms.
  Hashem a chill run through her spine.</font></p>
