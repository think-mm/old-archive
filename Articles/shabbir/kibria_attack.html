	An afterthought of grenade attack in Habiganj: Who provides shelter for the

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#000080" size="4"><b>
	<a href="index.html">Shabbir 
  Ahmed</a></b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A gruesome grenade attack has taken 
	the life of a great bureaucrat-turn politician named Mr. S. A. M. S. Kibria 
	in Bangladesh. As a former diplomat, he earned great reputation both inside 
	and outside Bangladesh. He even served as the head of an agency under United 
	Nations. For quite sometime, he has been writing in-depth analytical essays 
	in both English and Bengali. Like many others, I used to enjoy reading his 
	essays on sociopolitical and economic issues of Bangladesh. Unfortunately, a 
	personality like him had to die in the hands of the terrorists. The 
	conscious people of Bangladesh have been deeply saddened and shocked for his 
	sudden untimely death in a grenade attack. Just a few months ago, there was 
	a grenade attack on the Awami League leaders in Dhaka midtown. In that 
	attack more than twenty leaders and workers died. More than two hundred 
	Awami League leaders and workers were injured. The government failed to 
	identify the perpetrators of that gruesome killing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people have been writing about 
	all these attacks against Awami League, especially, now after the death of 
	Mr. Kibria. Some has expressed that it is the continuation of the attack 
	that took place on 8/21last year. In my opinion, the killing of high-profile 
	Awami League leaders started in earnest in 1975 with the killing of 
	Bongobonddhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his close associates. Since then, the 
	characters of the killers and the beneficiaries have not changed at all. The 
	motive and interest of the killers and the beneficiaries and their patrons 
	have remained the same as it was in 1975. The killers of 1975 were able to 
	capture the state power for a few months before their patrons and 
	beneficiaries took control of Bangladesh under the leadership of military 
	dictator Gen. Ziaur Rahman. Since then, Bangladesh is being ruled most of 
	the time by the same group of people consisting of the beneficiaries and 
	patrons of the killers of 1975. Now, the patrons and beneficiaries along 
	with Jamaat-i-Islamists are ruling Bangladesh. It is not difficult to 
	understand that the present regime of the beneficiaries and the patrons will 
	never try to get into the causes of the deaths of so many leaders and 
	workers of Awami League including the recent killing of Mr. Kibria. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We should look into the alleged 
	patronization of the killers by the present administration of the 
	fundamentalist alliance government of Jamaat-i-Islami and Bangladesh 
	Nationalist Party. The present government released one of the accused of the 
	jail killing case after they came into power in 2001. They even appointed 
	him as a director in the foreign ministry. Gen Ziaur Rahman gave jobs to the 
	killers of Bongobondhu in foreign ministry. The present Prime Minister 
	Khaleda Zia brought one of the killers of Bongobondhu and his associates 
	into the parliament as the opposition party leader after rigging election in 
	February 1996. The recent verdict on jail killing was a staged fiasco. The 
	government changed the judge and the government prosecutors to get verdicts 
	in favor of the accused. One of the accused is a top ranking leader of the 
	ruling alliance. You figure it out whether justice is possible under the 
	present circumstance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On August 21, 2004, the government 
	staged a number of arranged fiascos. First, they wanted to express sympathy 
	and later they tried their best to blame victim Awami League for the killing 
	of their top ranking leaders and workers. The lawmakers of the 
	fundamentalist alliance even laughed and questioned why more Awami League 
	leaders including Sheikh Hasina did not die after the heinous grenade attack 
	on that August day. They are quite adept in the staging of this type of 
	drama. In fact, the founder of BNP, the dictator Gen. Ziaur Rahman knew this 
	art of deception and tricks rather well. On jail killing case, a judicial 
	inquiry was formed probably (if I recall correctly) under Justice K. M. 
	Sobhan. However, internally, the dictator General did not allow him to do 
	the necessary functions on the investigation. In addition, Gen Zia was 
	patronizing simultaneously the killers by giving them lucrative jobs in 
	Foreign Service. Later, the dictator General gave indemnity to the killers 
	through his rubber stamp parliament. Receiving impunity through political 
	patronage was legitimized in Bangladesh way back in 1976-77. The founding 
	father of BNP should have received an award for his ingenuity posthumously.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, we observe the similar tricks 
	played by the followers of the dictator Gen. Ziaur Rahman. They have been 
	expressing their sympathy first and later they have been doing everything 
	possible to cover up the killers. Even they used the government 
	investigators to destroy the traces of evidences in the crime scene. They 
	have been employing these deceptive techniques for a long time. 
	Unfortunately, they got away with all these conspiracies quite effectively. 
	In the recent times, we are observing the concerns of even the foreign 
	diplomats and the foreign media due to the increased role of deception and 
	tricks employed by the present fundamentalist alliance government. After the 
	killing of Mr. S. A. M. S. Kibria, the foreign diplomats, especially, the U. 
	S. and European Union diplomats have expressed their suspicion about the 
	sincerity of the government in bringing the killers into book. It can be 
	concluded that the deceptive techniques of the present fundamentalist 
	partners has been exposed to all quarters. The shelf life of this deceptive 
	trick has all but expired in this day of Internet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, I must concur with other 
	writers that this killing of Mr. Kibria is a great loss for Bangladesh. Mr. 
	Kibria showed how an international figure like him could do writings and 
	politics to represent the people of his ancestral village in Hobigonj. I do 
	not believe that the present conspiratorial government of the fundamentalist 
	alliance will try the killers and save people like Mr. Kibria. For this, a 
	resistance should be built against the present fascist regime of the 
	fundamentalist alliance of Jamaat-I-Islami, Islami Oyko Jot, and their 
	protector, the BNP. Or else, the nation will plunge into anarchy from where 
	there is no turning point. The vicious development in Bangladesh has 
	implications for rest of the South Asian nations and for that matter for the 
	entire world. Therefore, donor nations including America should apply 
	pressure on the present government to catch the culprits who do not live in 
	vacuum in a densely populated country. The other possibility could be 
	resignation en masse at this time by Khaleda Zia and her trusted 
	lieutenants. Lest Mrs. Zia forgot, the wellbeing of 145 million people is at 
	stake here. </font></p>
