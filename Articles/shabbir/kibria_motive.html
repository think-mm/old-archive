	Kibria Killing: Motives for wiping out the vestiges of secular intellectuals

	<a href="index.html">Shabbir 
  Ahmed</a></b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is increasingly becoming difficult 
	to accept the killing of a renowned former diplomat and the ex- finance 
	minister, Mr. Shah A. M. S. Kibria. The more we read the more we feel pain 
	for the loss due to his premature death in the hands of the goons supported 
	by a vested quarter. As a former high official of United Nations and of 
	Bangladesh Government, he could easily enjoy his retirement without getting 
	involved into the chaotic politics of Bangladesh. He could enjoy the retired 
	life visiting friends and families in Europe, America, and Bangladesh. 
	However, he did not do that. He chose to live permanently in Bangladesh. He 
	did not even live in an isolated fashion in Dhaka. He got involved in 
	politics to do good for the people of his motherland. As we read more and 
	more after his death, we learn how he improved the economy of Bangladesh as 
	a successful finance minister during 1996-2001. In particular, his tireless 
	efforts (as the former finance minister) for the eradication of poverty by 
	adopting various economic policies brought results to the impoverished 
	nation. He was the pioneer in adopting many welfare programs for the poorest 
	of the poor in Bangladesh. As a brilliant economist, he was able to create 
	programs that helped flow money to the people of lowest rung in Bangladesh 
	society. A few of the programs developed by him that aimed at widows, 
	elderly people and flood victims, benefited millions of poor population in 
	Bangladesh. The Bangalees will forever remember him with love and respect 
	for what he did for the welfare of the impoverished millions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The brilliant people like Mr. Kibria 
	are not appreciated by the present regime under Khaleda Zia and Maulana 
	Matiur Rahman Nizami. The educational qualifications of the present Prime 
	Minister give rise to questions concerning her abilities to understand and 
	appreciate highly educated people in Bangladesh. Her capabilities for 
	generating and adopting policies for the benefit of a highly populous 
	country Bangladesh are equally questionable. Her partner in power &quot;Maulana 
	Matiur Rahman Nizami&quot; is a top-ranking leader of the fundamentalist 
	Jamaat-i-Islami, who is widely known as one of the war criminals for he 
	played a very dirty game that led to the killing of Bangalees in 1971. 
	Suppressing and killing of dissenting voices are natural characters of the 
	present regime. As always, they use their cadres secretly to kill the 
	renowned individual and use the law enforcing agencies to take necessary 
	steps to conceal the facts. One can easily understand and find out that 
	after taking over power in 2001, the gang of fundamentalists under the 
	leadership of Khaleda Zia and Maulana Matiur Rahman Nizami gave clear 
	signals to their cadres to target the secular and non-communal intellectuals 
	of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While secular and non-communal Awami 
	League was in power, it was alleged that the fundamentalist cadres belonging 
	to the parties under the present coalition government attacked and issued 
	threats to many secular/non-communal organizations. During that time, there 
	were a good number of accused criminals in various jails for the cases on 
	Udichi murder, Journalist Shamsur Rahman killing, Ramna bomb blast, attempts 
	for bomb blasts in Kotalipara, killing in a rally in Chittagong, killing in 
	Church, etc. All these cases were either withdrawn or thrown into the cold 
	storage after the fundamentalist coalition government came to power in 2001. 
	It was reported and alleged that the present fundamentalist alliance 
	government released all the criminals belonging to the fundamentalist 
	groups. In addition, the government took steps to terrorize the secular 
	intellectuals. They arrested, harassed, and tortured Professor Muntasir 
	Mamun, Dr. M. Khan Alamgir, Journalist Shahriar Kabir, and many others 
	without bringing any charge against them. By doing all these, the government 
	created a congenial atmosphere for the killer terrorists belonging to the 
	communal and fundamentalist groups to go after the secular 
	independent-minded intellectuals and politicians in the country. The 
	fundamentalist terrorists understood that they could easily get out of jail 
	through the coverage and support from the present government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many expatriate secular Bangalees 
	were anxious and worried about the fate of the intellectuals living in 
	Bangladesh after the present fundamentalist regime came to power in 2001. In 
	particular, the Bangalees experienced the loss of a good number of 
	intellectuals in 1971. The armed faction of Jamaat-i-Islami called Al-Badars 
	and Al-Shams killed many great souls of Bangladesh at the fag end of their 
	defeat in December 1971. The cowards killed many professors, doctors, 
	journalists, and other professionals. Unfortunately, the party 
	Jamaat-i-Islami came back to the politics through a series of conspiracies 
	with the help of the present prime minister’s husband, a military dictator 
	named Gen Ziaur Rahman. Gradually they have gained power in a coalition with 
	the late military dictator’s party through a conspiratorial election in 
	2001. Now this vile group of the fundamentalists is ruling Bangladesh.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the character of the present 
	ruling class, it is a matter of concern for the safety and security of the 
	secular-minded non-communal intellectuals in Bangladesh. With all our 
	concerns, we observed how the gang of the fundamentalists was inspired by 
	Maulana Delwar Hussain Saidee and others in the fundamentalist-dominated 
	Bangladesh parliament to attack Professor Humayun Azad, who later died in 
	Germany. They continued killings and issued threats to many secular 
	individuals. Finally, the terrorists killed a brilliant economist, a 
	renowned diplomat, and a successful former finance minister. The pattern of 
	the killings suggests that the terrorists have targeted the intellectuals 
	belonging to or close to a secular and non-communal party Awami League. The 
	terrorists want to destroy the think-tank of this party. Of course, Mr. 
	Kibria was the most brilliant thinker behind Awami League, who helped this 
	party to win election in 1996. Later, he worked extremely hard to uplift the 
	economy of the country ruled mostly by the martial and semi-martial regimes.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The terrorists belonging to the 
	fundamentalist groups never consider the intellectual abilities of a 
	respected individual. In fact, their prime targets are the intellectual 
	people in Bangladesh. Like Talibans, the fundamentalists would not 
	appreciate the qualifications of a respected person. In Bangladesh, the 
	semi-fundamentalist cadres belonging to Khaleda Zia’s party have joined 
	hands with the hardcore fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami. That is why, it is 
	alleged by all quarters that the terrorists belonging to the ruling alliance 
	are responsible for the killing of Mr. Kibria. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How will the protectors of the 
	terrorists provide justice to such a high-profile killing? With this 
	question in mind, how long the people of Bangladesh have to wait to watch 
	the staged drama of the investigation performed under the supervision of the 
	actors belonging to the ruling fundamentalist alliance? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, ambassadors of many 
	countries including USA have expressed their doubt and concern about the 
	ability and sincerity of the present regime of Bangladesh to catch and try 
	the killers. Consequently, the family members of Mr. Kibria and the 
	conscious people are raising the legitimate demand for an independent 
	international inquiry into the killing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As reported, FBI, the federal agency 
	of the U.S. government, would investigate only if they are given full access 
	during investigation. In fact, this present government has lost trust both 
	at the national and international levels. They should accept the reality and 
	take responsibility before it is too late. The sooner they realize, the 
	better it will be for the image of the country. With their departure from 
	power, Bangladesh will be able to get a chance to advance toward secular 
	democracy and try the killers belonging to the fundamentalist and 
	semi-fundamentalist groups who are actively involved in the killings of 
	intellectuals for paving the way for the Talibanization of Bangladesh.
