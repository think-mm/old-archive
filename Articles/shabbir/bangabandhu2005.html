	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The students of history of South 
	Asia know it too well that the partition of India into two nations did not 
	bode well for us, the inhabitants of the then East Pakistan. Punjabi clique 
	ruled our motherland for a long time and that includes the military and the 
	communal forces of Pakistan. These Islam-based communal forces tried to 
	suppress the secular political and cultural tradition of our ancestral 
	homeland. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To implement their sectarian Islamic 
	Ummaism, the communal ruling class of Pakistan denied the right of the 
	Bengalis to use their language in the state of Pakistan. Even the communal 
	ruling class tried to ban and restrict the cultural activities of our 
	people. Most of the non-communal political and intellectual forces of 
	erstwhile East Pakistan were frustrated under the rule of the communal 
	system of Pakistan. At that time, Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 
	organized the secular and non-communal intellectuals and other social forces 
	of our motherland to stand against the military and their allied 
	fundamentalist “Muslim Leaguers” of Pakistan. He received a full support 
	(except a few pro-Pakistani collaborators) for the political and cultural 
	freedom of the Bengalis. He continued his relentless struggle and suffered 
	for a long time in the jails of Pakistan. It was possible for a towering and 
	charismatic leader like Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to unite our 
	people against the communal ruling classes of Pakistan, who were using Islam 
	at all levels to keep our motherland under their Ummatic system. Bongobondhu 
	was a believer in Islam but opposed to the use of religion Islam in 
	politics. That is precisely why the first parliament in Bangladesh wrote the 
	constitution that banned all the Islamic political parties. Bongobondhu had 
	this farsightedness to realize that the aspirations of Bengalis could never 
	be met by the religious traders who kowtowed the ruling Punjabi clique from 
	the then West Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, after Bangladesh’s 
	independence the banning of the communal politics using Islam did not 
	prevent the pro-Islamic political goons from continuing destructive politics 
	by joining hands with many other extremists. Most of the cadres of the 
	Islamic parties went underground. At the same time, the Maoists/communists 
	formed underground political parties with armed cadres to carry on armed 
	revolution inside our motherland. In the aftermath of the independence of 
	Bangladesh, all these underground extremists created a terrible condition in 
	the newly born republic. Even the ultra-leftists formed political parties 
	and their armed wings (such as Gonobahini) to implement “scientific 
	socialism,” a term not quite clear even to the proponents. To protect the 
	country and its independence, Bongobondhu took a temporary measure to unite 
	all the pro-liberation forces of our motherland under Bangladesh Krishak 
	Sramik Awami League (BKSAL). Unfortunately, he along with most of the 
	members of his family was murdered before he could able to implement the 
	programs under BKSAL. In the wake of the independence of Bangladesh, there 
	was a need for bringing stability in the country before allowing free-will 
	politics. However, Bongobondhu was a leader who believed in multi-party 
	political system. That is why, immediately after the independence he allowed 
	political activities of all parties except the Islamic parties that 
	performed genocide and spread communalism in Bangladesh under the occupation 
	of Pakistani army for nine long months in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At a later stage, it was necessary 
	to go for a restricted democracy due to the extremists of the armed wings of 
	the communists and the defeated Islamic forces. But disregarding the 
	restricted democracy under BKSAL, one would find pragmatism for the 
	development of the future of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bongobondhu. 
	The administrative reforms that were supposed to take place under BKSAL 
	would have brought significant effects on the condition of Bangladesh. All 
	the districts were supposed to be getting autonomy under a representative 
	executive body headed by the governor. Under this system, most of the 
	development programs could have been implemented directly by the district 
	administration. The bureaucratic system under the secretariat was supposed 
	to be cut down to a minimum level. The central ministry was supposed to be 
	mostly providing funds to the districts. The agricultural reforms could have 
	brought self-sufficiency in food a long time ago. It was planned to 
	cultivate under cooperatives where the government would provide modern 
	equipments and other resources. According to the plan, the owner, the 
	government (for providing resources), and the laborer (for providing labor) 
	would get the share of the production. A massive plan was undertaken to 
	bring all the lands (including the ones that are not cultivated by the 
	owner) under cultivation. Unfortunately, Bongobondhu could not able to 
	materialize his vision of reforms especially in administration and 
	agriculture because of his assassination by a few disgruntled army officers. 
	It is noteworthy that the disgruntled army officers first declared 
	Bangladesh an Islamic republic after the assassination of Bongobondhu. The 
	Wahhabi hate kingdom “Saudi Arabia” and their partner Pakistan recognized 
	Bangladesh only after the death of our great leader Bongobondhu Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many researchers in Bangladesh and 
	abroad wrote on the life and politics of Bongobondhu. Of them, Dr. Habibur 
	Rahman, wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on &quot;Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the 
	Independence of Bangladesh&quot; in 1989. Based on his Ph.D. research, Dr. Rahman 
	later wrote a book titled &quot;Bangladesher Obvhuddhoy O Sheikh Mujib (Rise of 
	Bangladesh and Sheikh Mujib)&quot; in 1991 (City Press and Publishers, Dhaka, 
	Bangladesh). In the preface, Dr. Emaj Uddin Ahmed (a former vice chancellor 
	of Dhaka University) wrote on Bongobondhu as &quot;a leader ever memorable like 
	Mahatma Gandhi, Sukornao, Kamal Pasha, et al.” In this book, Dr. Rahman 
	wrote elaborately and neutrally like a researcher on the rule under Pakistan 
	and the political programs and organization under the leadership of 
	Bonbondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Especially, he wrote about the difficulties 
	encountered by the government under Bongobondhu in the post-war Bangladesh. 
	He mentioned about the destructive activities of the opportunists in his own 
	party and the extremists belonging to the armed wings of different 
	underground political parties. Despite the failures in controlling the 
	chaotic condition in the post-war Bangladesh, Dr. Rahman wrote about some 
	far reaching successes of the government. In particular, he highlighted the 
	decision of the government in taking over the financial responsibilities of 
	all the primary schools in the villages and tax exemption for the poor 
	farmers (up to 25 bighas of land). We can come to know from his research 
	that the government for the first time provided forty thousand power pumps, 
	ten thousand shallow pumps, and three thousand deep pumps to the farmers of 
	Bangladesh. Dr. Rahman elaborately mentioned about the programs (under BKSAL) 
	taken by then government a bit early to eradicate poverty and hunger through 
	massive cooperative programs in the agro-based areas in the villages 
	throughout Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who observed Bongobondhu 
	closely and studied his policies and rule, gives overall positive high marks 
	for his sincerity to eradicate poverty and communal Islamic politics from 
	the soil of Bangladesh. It is a tragedy that the people of Bangladesh lost 
	such a great leader only after three and half years of the independence of 
	Bangladesh. All the Bengalis regard him as the founder and the father of the 
	nation of Bangladesh except a few followers of the military rulers and the 
	followers of the political Mullahs who were our Fifth Columnists. The 
	descendants of the communal forces ideologically attached to the 
	Mullah-Military alliance of Pakistan and Bangladesh try to create 
	controversy on Bongobondhu. In fact, their followers are now in the catbird 
	seat of power. They are the ones who are re-writing the textbooks to inject 
	confusion amongst the future generations of Bangladesh. But, they won't be 
	able to succeed because it is the &quot;truth&quot; that ultimately will prevail.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bongobondhu’s contribution for 
	Bengalis will remain afresh in the minds of millions of people. It is a 
	small wonder that in recent BBC survey he was voted as number one Bengali to 
	set foot in this mortal world. </font></p>
