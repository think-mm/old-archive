	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because of the folly of a few 
	politicians who wanted to rig the election by questionable means our 
	motherland, Bangladesh, went through a period of turmoil and turbulence 
	before the current government under Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed took over power. 
	The people of Bangladesh including the expatriate Bangalees were happy to 
	see the change of the government. It was anticipated that Bangladesh would 
	be governed by a well-educated and well-experienced person like Dr. 
	Fakhruddin Ahmed, who would uphold the rule of law and human rights in 
	Bangladesh. As far as I remember, he himself expressed his determination in 
	his first speech to maintain the human rights and rule of law for the people 
	of Bangladesh. Unfortunately, there occurred a number of disturbing 
	incidences in Bangladesh while the government is headed by a 
	western-educated individual like Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, who seemingly 
	appeared to be committed to prevent any violation of human rights. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the disturbing occurrences is 
	the killing of Mr. Cholesh Richil (a Garo tribe leader) by the combined 
	forces consisting of army, police, and rapid action battalion. Dr. Zafar 
	Iqbal wrote a sub-editorial on the gruesome killing of Mr. Richil by the 
	combined forces in vernacular newspaper, Prothom-Alo, a few days ago. It is 
	difficult to control emotion for the victim, Mr. Cholesh Richil and to 
	control anger against those who committed the crime by killing him 
	mercilessly. The description of the killing given by Dr. Zafar Iqbal exposed 
	the sadistic and animalistic nature of those individuals, who killed the 
	minority community leader from Madhupur area of Mymensingh district. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Zafar Iqbal’s sub-editorial 
	indicates that Mr. Richil was returning from the wedding ceremony of his 
	nephew while he was picked up by forty armed persons of the combined forces. 
	They took him to their camp where they tied the victim to a window grill. An 
	officer ordered his people to give Mr. Richil a lesson. Following the army 
	boss’s order, nine people started beating Mr. Richil in an inhuman and 
	brutal fashion. At one point, Mr. Richil started throwing blood through his 
	mouth and became unconscious. When he got his conscious back, the killers 
	started to beat him again. Then, they poured hot water through the nose of 
	the victim. The killers did several things that include: taking his nails 
	off from the fingers, inserting nails in his hands and legs, and gauged his 
	eyes. Dr. Zafar Iqbal knew about many more torture unleashed upon Mr. Richil 
	but these were so brutal, sadistic, and animalistic that he preferred not to 
	mention them at all. Finally, the hapless victim died in the hands of his 
	killers of the combined forces. We saw and heard about these brutalities by 
	the Pakistani military in 1971 but in 2007 Mr. Richil was tortured and 
	killed by the combined forces of his own country Bangladesh, which receives 
	100% of its funding from taxpayers such as Mr. Richil. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are ample reasons why the 
	combined forces targeted the Garo community leader. Read on and you will 
	learn more on this. Originally, Mr. Cholesh Richil antagonized the 
	fundamentalist alliance government under Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) 
	and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI). The government wanted to establish an Eco-Park in 
	Modhupur, where Garo tribe people lived. It was planned to evict about 
	twenty five thousand Garo tribe people systematically from Modhupur. Mr. 
	Cholesh Richil organized the Garo tribe people and subsequently led a 
	protest rally on January 3, 2004. The police forces under then 
	fundamentalist government fired shots mercilessly at the rally. One person 
	died and many tribal people were wounded. Subsequently, the government filed 
	five thousand cases against the Garo people in Modhupur police station. In 
	almost all the cases, Cholesh Richil was named as an accused. Under protest 
	from different quarters along with the tribe people, the government stopped 
	building the Eco-Park. In the emergency rule under the government of Dr. 
	Fakhruddin Ahmed, the works on building the Eco-Park resumed. Mr. Cholesh 
	Richil again organized the tribe people and protested. As a consequence, he 
	was picked up and later killed by a group of people belonging to the 
	combined forces. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a Bangla vernacular newspaper it 
	was recently mentioned that the forest department officials in Madhupur has 
	adversarial relationship with Mr. Richil. The Garo community leader opposed 
	indiscriminate cutting of the trees in the nearby forest. In all likelihood 
	the forest officials were illegally cutting the trees to pocket the money. 
	Therefore, they also targeted Mr. Richil for harassment. It makes sense why 
	the government forces had arrested the minority community leader. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In another development, in the SAARC 
	summit, Asian Center for Human Rights sent the description of this brutal 
	killing to the participating heads of the governments of the member 
	countries. The head of Bangladesh government Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed should 
	know about the brutal killing of Mr. Cholesh Richil. Since the home ministry 
	and the government as a whole is under his control, it is our expectation 
	that Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed would take necessary steps to bring those into 
	justice, who committed such a gruesome murder and crime. If he remains 
	silent and indifferent, then there will be enough reasons for people to 
	doubt about his sincerity in terms of establishing human rights and rule of 
	law throughout Bangladesh. Anyone can evaluate him as a man full of words 
	but not full of deeds. He should act because for a few bad people, the 
	principle of the armed forces and the law enforcement agency people of 
	Bangladesh should not be questioned in the whole world. The inertness on Dr. 
	Fakhruddin's part will not enhance the sagging image of his government and 
	the country as a whole. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the past, while the newsman, Tipu 
	Sultan was beaten by Joynal Hazari’s goons, the newspapers took an active 
	role to protest and raised funds for the victim. Even some of the expatriate 
	Bangalees took very praise-worthy steps to collect funds. It is a mystery 
	for a relative silence of the media and other organizations on the brutal 
	and gruesome murder of Mr. Cholesh Richil. I sincerely hope that Mr. 
	Richil’s ethnicity is not the reason for this deafening silence and 
	indifference on the part of mainstream newspapers. I hope that all will come 
	forward and will raise their strong voice to protest the killing of an 
	innocent man, who was killed so brutally and mercilessly.</font></p>
