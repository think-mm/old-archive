				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Cyberspace opened the 
				door for exchanging ideas on various issues among 
				Bangladesh-origin freethinkers. It helped a good number of 
				Bangalees to express their opinion in different Internet forums. 
				A few of the forums were started by brave Bangalees, who allowed 
				the writers to express their opinion freely against religious 
				bigotry and superstitious belief system. Of these forums, 
				Mukto-Mona (<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com">www.mukto-mona.com</a>) 
				took the lead in allowing freethinking and exchanging ideas 
				based on rational thinking. The founder of this forum is Avijit 
				Roy. He participated in many discussions himself and allowed 
				others to do so. In fact, he played the role as one of the 
				pioneers in bringing together a group of Bangladesh-origin 
				writers in Mukto-Mona. Especially, he writes eloquently in both 
				Bengali and English. To convey the messages to a wide group of 
				Bangalee readers, it is important to write in Bengali. Mainly, 
				the young Bangalees should get the knowledge on scientific facts 
				by reading science-based essays and eventually be able to 
				question the philosophies of bigotry and superstition. This is 
				what <i>Skepticism</i> is - a vital part of science. In this 
				respect, Avijit Roy has a superb capability in communicating his 
				rational thoughts in Bengali. I read many (if not all) of his 
				essays in both Bengali and English. While writing rebuttals and 
				taking part in discussions, he was writing investigative essays 
				in an organized fashion. In particular, he devoted his 
				investigation to use scientific truth to rebut the beliefs based 
				on nothing but mental blindness and superstition. Based on his 
				diligent effort, he has written the recently published book 
				titled &quot;Alo Hate choliyachey adharer Jatri.&quot; (Publisher: Ankur 
				Prakashani, April: 2005, ISBN : 984 464 124 1) This book will 
				definitely help a good number of Bangalee readers to open their 
				minds about the scientific truth against myths and 
				superstitions.&nbsp; </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the book &quot;Alo Hate 
				choliyachey adharer Jatri&quot;, Avijit Roy presents science as a 
				means to understand the origin and existence of the natural 
				systems of the universe in both space and time. To make the 
				&quot;spatial and temporal processes in the universe&quot; understandable 
				to the readers, he writes about the contribution of the great 
				scientists in a systematic and logical fashion. He started his 
				book with the analysis of the contribution of Isaac Newton and 
				continued explaining the monumental contribution of Galileo, 
				Albert Einstein, George Gammow, Jocelyn Bell, Vera Rubin, John 
				Schwarz, Joel Scherk, Ed Witten, Sheldon Glasgow, Steven 
				Weinberg, Stephen Hawking and many other illuminating scientists 
				whom Avijit correctly denotes as “Alo Hatey chola Adharer 
				Jaatree”. Readers will also get inspiration to see the 
				contribution of Meghnad Saha, Satyen Bose, C.V. Raman, Abdus 
				Salam, Chandrashekhar et al, indeed some of them were from our 
				Bangalee origin. In addition to the analysis of the contribution 
				of these scientists, he writes quite eloquently about the 
				phenomena of the <i>Expanding Universe</i>, <i>Inverse law of 
				Gravitation</i>, <i>Special and General theory of Relativity, 
				Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Vacuum Fluctuation, Big Crunch, 
				Accelerating Universe, Big Rip, Superstring theory,</i> etc. in 
				a way that would be understandable to most of the Bangalee 
				readers having little or no scientific background. While 
				explaining these complex phenomena and processes, he adds a 
				scholarly appendix at the end of his book for the satisfaction 
				of more educated readers. He also points out extensively about 
				the struggle of the scientists for establishing the scientific 
				facts against the superstitious belief system in those days. 
				Unfortunately, the struggle of the scientists and freethinkers 
				is not over yet, especially, in a country like Bangladesh. 
				That's why, a book in Bengali titled &quot;Alo Hate choliyachey 
				adharer Jatri&quot;, is a timely and a courageous effort of Avijit 
				Roy, a great freethinker and an emerging scientist. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The blind believers 
				believe that everything came into being just because a 
				supernatural power thought to create all the processes at a 
				certain instant of time in the infinite past. It is an over 
				simplification of the existence of the whole complex processes 
				in the universe. With this sort of belief system, a good number 
				of Bangalee scientists work on their areas of expertise without 
				questioning &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; regarding the changes in the 
				universe, evolution in earth, theories contradictory to the 
				sudden creation, etc. In fact, if it were so simple to analyze 
				based on the will of a great creator, then it would have been 
				better because the scientists in the past and at the present 
				would not have to worry about the complexities centering the 
				origin and existence of the spatially and temporally varying 
				universe. But, it is not simply true based on the solution given 
				by a great creator. Unfortunately, the believer scientists and 
				gullible philosophers around the globe do not try to go into the 
				in-depth analysis contradictory to the belief system centering a 
				great creator. They continue their research and development on 
				theories of physics, mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc. to 
				try to solve current and future problems without questioning the 
				contradictions caused by the simplified belief system on the 
				variations of the processes in the universe from the infinite 
				past to the infinite future. Avijit Roy very carefully 
				highlights the simplified conclusions of the believer scientists 
				and philosophers that bear no scientific basis. In many cases, 
				the believers jump into conclusions to justify their belief 
				system using the facts/hypotheses of the hard working 
				scientists. They even try to give credits to the great creator 
				(whom they believe in unquestionably) based on the findings of 
				the heart and soul efforts of many great scientists. Avijit Roy 
				gives many examples. In one example, he gives the statement of 
				an Islamic thinker on Big Bang theory. One of the prominent 
				Islamic thinkers named Mr. Harun Yahya wrote (&quot;Alo Hate 
				choliyachey adharer Jatri&quot;, page 67):&nbsp; </font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">&quot;Scientists are 
					now certain that the universe came into being from 
					nothingness as the result of an unimaginably huge explosion, 
					known as the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. In other words, the universe came 
					into being - or rather, Allah created it.&quot; </font></i></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above statement 
				reflects the views of many defenders (scientists/thinkers) of 
				the blind belief systems that only teach them to over simplify 
				the complex processes in the name of an almighty creator. With 
				appreciation, I should say that Avijit Roy explains the facts 
				against the blindness of the believer scientists/philosophers. 
				As an applied scientist, he broke the norm and started 
				questioning and searching about the space-time relationships of 
				the processes in the universe. Through his continued efforts, he 
				learned about the contribution of the scientists and the complex 
				processes of physics that explains many of the questions of a 
				freethinker. In chapter two, maintaining an impartial style in 
				describing history of science and demystifying all types of 
				religious bigotry, Avijit demonstrates how Christian 
				fundamentalism once literally shackled the minds of men for 
				thousands of years, and held back the advancement of science. 
				The Biblical belief system was used as evidences against Galileo 
				and Bruno, who argued for the theory of Copernicus that the 
				earth was not immovable, rather rotated around the sun. 
				Interested readers will find that it was just few years ago- in 
				1992, after 350 years of demise of Galileo, Pope John Paul II 
				(recently deceased) formally apologized for the persecution of 
				Galileo, though the Church till date is silent about Bruno (Alo 
				Hate, page 33), who was brutally burned at stake – a more severe 
				persecution from the Church compared to the fate of Galileo, for 
				supporting Copernicus’s heliocentric model, which was to become 
				the key insight that led to our present view of the world. In 
				chapter seven, Avijit writes extensively about the mysteries of 
				the universe and the contradictions caused by the simplified 
				belief in a great creator. His essays remind us late Carl Sagan, 
				famous astrophysicist and advocator of <i>Modern Scientific 
				Humanism</i>:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">The idea that God 
					is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in 
					the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. 
					But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern 
					the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is 
					emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to 
					pray to the law of gravity. </font></i><font face="Verdana">
					[Carl Sagan]</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Avijit Roy reveals 
				himself as an engineer in the book. In fact, engineers are 
				supposed to be the applied physicists and applied 
				mathematicians. Unlike many engineers, I find his exceptional 
				inquisitive mind that he used to search for scientific truths 
				like a physicist. His latest book tells us how science leads us 
				toward <i>rationalism</i>, basing conclusions on logic and 
				evidences. He organized all of his findings and put together in 
				a book to enlighten fellow Bangalee readers. I thank and 
				congratulate him for all that he did in this regard.</font></p>
