  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most history 
  books and memoir written on our glorious struggle for independence in 1971 
  would tell you that the freedom movement was a victory for secular democracy 
  against the tyranny of the military and theocratic rules of Pakistan.&nbsp; The 
  military rulers of Pakistan intentionally used Islamic fundamentalism to 
  suppress the rule of law in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and in the rest of 
  Pakistan.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the contrary, the 
  pragmatic leaders of Bangladesh stood against the oppressive rule of the joint 
  forces of the military and their allied fundamentalist forces long before 
  1971.&nbsp; Finally, the democratic forces won the election in December 1970 
  defeating the allied fundamentalist forces of the military rulers.&nbsp; 
  Nevertheless, the defeated forces united using Islam as their shield to 
  overturn the election results.&nbsp; As a result, the people of Bangladesh 
  protested and created pressure on their elected leader Bongobondhu Sheikh 
  Mujibur Rahman to separate Bangladesh from Jinnah’s Pakistan.&nbsp; The Bongobondhu 
  declared independence a short time before he was arrested in the wee hours of 
  March 26, 1971 as Punjabi soldiers whisked him away in a military vehicle.&nbsp; 
  That however did not stop Bangalees from fighting; they fought bravely with 
  the help of the Indian forces to get rid of the brutal rule of the Islamic 
  Republic of Pakistan.&nbsp; After independence, Bangladesh declared itself as a 
  Peoples Republic to fulfill the aspirations of all Bangalees (Muslims, Hindus, 
  Christians, Buddhists, agnostics, atheists, et al.).&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The people of 
  Bangladesh got the bitter experience of Taliban–type rule of the joint forces 
  of the Pakistan military and their allied fundamentalist forces in 1971.&nbsp; The 
  paramilitary forces were trained to Islamize the Bangalee society.&nbsp; As a part 
  of their Islamization, these brutal forces, namely, Al-Badars, Al-Shams, 
  Razakars, etc., used to kill educated and liberal people of Bangladesh.&nbsp; They 
  also killed many people belonging to the opposition parties and the minorities 
  just like Gestapo, the brutal forces of Hitler.&nbsp; The aforementioned 
  paramilitary forces consisting of the Jamaat-i-Islami and Muslim League cadres 
  carried out genocide and rape of women in the name of protecting Islam and 
  Pakistan.&nbsp; Because of their brutalities, the first government of Bangladesh 
  banned these Islamic parties through a popular support of the mass.&nbsp; However, 
  the disciples of Hitler however emerged silently through underground 
  conspiracies with the help of a conspirator general by the name Ziaur Rahman.&nbsp; 
  The general’s wife has finally brought the killer forces to power in the 
  aftermath of the election in October 2001.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite the popular 
  support for banning the Islamic political parties in Bangladesh, the Talibani 
  forces were eventually able to reorganize and regroup their political parties 
  legally and came to power eventually with their coalition partners.&nbsp; This has 
  happened because the secular principle of Bangladesh was nipped at the bud on 
  August 15, 1975 with the brutal murder of Bongobandhu, his family members, and 
  some Awami League Leaders.&nbsp; The entire process was completed in the first week 
  of November 1975 when the vile force killed the remaining topnotch leaders of 
  Awami League when they were interned in Dhaka’s Central Jail.&nbsp; The 
  fundamentalist forces proceeded silently in a stepwise process after killing 
  the entire command structure of Awami League.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Initially, the 
  conspiratorial force made a blueprint with the help of the general by the name 
  Ziaur Rahman to revive their politics in the name of multi-party democracy.&nbsp; 
  Simultaneously, they continued their Wahhabism-based politics with the help of 
  their masters in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; It is relevant to mention that 
  these two countries (Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) recognized Bangladesh one or 
  two days after the death of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who mobilized a 
  vast majority of Bangalees against the political Islamists and the Pakistani 
  military.&nbsp; With the death of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, his government 
  collapsed and the political Islamists succeeded in bringing about the 
  necessary changes for taking Bangladesh into the path of Talibanism, Wahhabism, 
  obscurantism, and Islamic bigotry.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A question certainly 
  arises about the reason for the failure and near-demise of secularism in 
  Bangladesh, once a fertile ground for freethinking.&nbsp; It lasted only for about 
  three and a half year period until the collapse of the Awami League government 
  under the leadership of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.&nbsp; There are many 
  reasons for the failure.&nbsp; One of the reasons is the political nature of Islam 
  as a religion.&nbsp; The political Islamists wrongly thought that they would be 
  able to have a better system of governance under the rule of seventh-century 
  old Sha’ria.&nbsp; A vast majority of the political workers and preachers belonging 
  to the Islamic political parties are shrewd enough to misguide common people 
  by preaching in mosques and religious gatherings in favor of Sha’ria.&nbsp; Many 
  political Islamists preached heavily in the religious gatherings against 
  secularism that was the basis for banning the Islamic political parties during 
  1972-‘75.&nbsp; The masses of Bangladesh were not all that happy with the Awami 
  League rule at that time because of the deteriorating economic condition and 
  the food supply situation but the political Islamists could not able to 
  succeed in motivating people toward them.&nbsp; For this, they schemed with the 
  conspiratorial General, Ziaur Rahman, to legalize their sectarian politics in 
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; Now, there are a good number of Islamic political parties doing 
  politics with a hope to implement barbaric and obscurantist Sha’ria Laws 
  sometime in the future in Bangladesh.&nbsp; The leading political party 
  Jamaat-i-Islami is now enjoying power with the blessings of the wife of late 
  General Ziaur Rahman as they together sit on the catbird seat of power in 
  Dhaka. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1972, the 
  government under Awami League banned the Islamic parties through a popular 
  mandate.&nbsp; The credit should be given to Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 
  his close associates, who realized the need for the separation of Islam and 
  politics in the newly formed republic.&nbsp; They separated religion from state 
  based on the spirit of the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971 and on one of the 
  preambles of 1972 Constitution.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Islamists gradually 
  undermined that spirit with the help of the pro-Pakistan and pro-Saudi Arab 
  conspirators.&nbsp; Of course, Bongobondhu and his associates were believers and 
  Muslims.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they were liberal Muslims having beliefs in Islam that 
  developed in Indian subcontinent.&nbsp; The conservative Muslims did not support 
  the banning of Islamic politics in Bangladesh.&nbsp; An overwhelming majority of 
  the Mullahs did not support the path of the separation of Islam from the 
  politics in Bangladesh.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, the Mullahs are the most learned persons 
  on religion “Islam.”&nbsp; In my personal inquiry as a skeptic (while I was in 
  Bangladesh), the Mullahs used to say that Islam couldn’t be separated from 
  politics.&nbsp; They used to give examples on the role of Prophet of Islam both as 
  a preacher and as a ruler.&nbsp; One cannot disagree with them on their logic.&nbsp; 
  That is probably the reason why many pious Muslims are soft on Jamaat-i-Islami 
  of Bangladesh.&nbsp; They were also soft on Talibans of Afghanistan.&nbsp; Some of the 
  western educated political Islamists are trying hard to change their color.&nbsp; 
  These days, they are trying to be politically correct and pretending their 
  dislikes for the Talibans.&nbsp; However, the same group generally remains silent 
  about the ascendance of Jamaat-i-Islami to power despite the genocidal acts 
  committed by Jamaat during the nine-month grueling period in 1971.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Erudite readers may 
  have noticed that a great majority of the Islam-educated Mullahs supports 
  mixing of Islam and politics just like the Wahhabism-based political party 
  Jamaat-i-Islami.&nbsp; This concept, Theo-Democracy, is the brainchild of Abu Ala 
  Moududi, the intellectual guru of Jamaat.&nbsp; The Mullahs who are adherent to 
  ‘Theo Democracy’ give examples of the Prophet and the Caliphs who ruled and 
  preached Islam at the same time.&nbsp; The western educated Mullahs also write 
  about the compatibility of Islam and democracy.&nbsp; Therefore, it is probably 
  true that Islam cannot be separated from politics.&nbsp; If this is the case, then, 
  how a Muslim-dominated country will be freed from the violent and sectarian 
  Islamic political parties.&nbsp; There will be always a good number of Mullahs, who 
  will try to follow the path of the Prophet and the four Caliphs to preach and 
  rule at the same time.&nbsp; Given a chance, they will enact barbaric laws 
  according to Sha’ria.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is a formidable 
  challenge to the secular people of the modern world to separate Islamic 
  politics from the governments in Muslim-dominated countries.&nbsp; The religionists 
  of all other religions sans Islam will not have equal democratic rights under 
  Islamic laws in a Muslim-dominated country if the political Islamists take 
  full control of the government.&nbsp; One could clearly see what is happening in 
  Pakistan, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, right now.&nbsp; In these countries, Islamic 
  laws dominate and marginalize the people of other religions.&nbsp; Therefore, the 
  focus of the democracy-loving people of the world should be to reform the 
  political philosophy of Islam in such a way that the Islam-educated Mullahs 
  and their followers follow only the path of preaching leaving aside politics.&nbsp; 
  These forces must be prevented at all cost from taking control of the 
  government that will eventually destroy the existence of a pluralism-based 
  democratic system. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion and 
  politics are like oil and water; if allowed to mix create a dangerous 
  situation under certain conditions.&nbsp; I touched on my personal experience to 
  promote the idea that religion should not be allowed to mingle with politics 
  because such mixing might engender a dire future for country such as 
  Bangladesh.</font></p>
