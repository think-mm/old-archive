  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>Honestly speaking, my
  motherland, Bangladesh, has become a very unsafe place for moderate people,
  freethinkers, and intellectuals under the aegis of the present
  government.&nbsp; A few days ago, it was reported that the goons of the ruling
  parties attacked a notable politician, Dr. Kamal Hussain.&nbsp; Today
  (February 27, 2004), the attack on Dr. Humayun Azad has become a news
  item.&nbsp; According to news report from diversified sources, he has been
  critically injured.&nbsp; As it appears, he is now fighting for his
  life.&nbsp; He has been transferred from Dhaka Medical College Hospital to the
  Combined Military Hospital.&nbsp; I’m sure that the physicians will try
  their best to save the life of this eminent scholar and intellectual.&nbsp;
  Bangladesh cannot afford to lose him.&nbsp; We don’t have many intellectuals
  the like Dr. Humayun Azad.<O>
  </O>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>During the rule of the former
  government under Awami League, the fundamentalist miscreants attacked Poet
  Shamsur Rahman.&nbsp; The memory of that attack is still fresh in my
  mind.&nbsp; He critically survived from the attacks.&nbsp; The investigation
  was carried out at that time and the government showed serious concerns for
  the attack on the eminent poet of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The newspaper reports
  indicated that a number of the fundamentalist goons were arrested.&nbsp;
  However, the present government has suppressed most of these types of serious
  cases after assuming power.&nbsp; It was noticed that the then main opposition
  party BNP including their partner Jamaat-i-Islami tried hard to downplay the
  heinous attack on Poet Shamsur Rahman.&nbsp; They were even ridiculing the
  grave attack as a staged drama.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they’re in power at the
  present time.&nbsp; That is why they’re downplaying all the attacks against
  the moderates, minorities, and eminent people of the country.&nbsp; This is
  resulting in a serious sense of insecurity to the liberal and rational
  thinkers of Bangladesh.&nbsp; <O>
  </O>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>These days, the government is
  not only downplaying but also distorting the facts.&nbsp; The Home Minister
  distorted the attack against Dr. Kamal Hussain by saying that the attacker was
  none but Dr. Kamal Hussain himself.&nbsp; It’s a matter of grave concern
  when the Home Minister of a country tries to cover up the attacks of the goons
  by accusing an eminent personality like Dr. Kamal Hussain.&nbsp; The goons are
  getting encouragement from the present government to attack the moderate and
  liberal people of the country.&nbsp; As a result, we are observing relentless
  attacks one after another.<O>

  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana"><span>The intellectuals such as Dr.
  Humayun Azad and late Dr. Ahmed Sharif were always under the Fatwa of the
  fundamentalist Maulanas (clerics) of Bangladesh.&nbsp; Many times, these
  disgruntle Maulanas associated with Jamaat-i-Islami issued Fatwa against the
  liberal/rational thinkers of Bangladesh.&nbsp; They always encourage their
  fundamentalist followers in meetings/gatherings to kill these
  intellectuals.&nbsp; So, it isn’t surprising that one group of these people
  conspired to kill a renowned intellectual like Dr. Humayun Azad.&nbsp; It’s
  highly likely because these groups openly declare Dr. Humayun Azad et al. as
  Murtads (apostates) and they try to incite their followers to kill them.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, these groups of people are sharing power now.&nbsp; They’re
  downplaying these crimes continuously.&nbsp; It was possible that these types
  of crimes could have taken place during the time of the former
  government.&nbsp; However, there were serious concerns and serious efforts by
  the government to bring the culprits into justice despite the cover-up of the
  then opposition party BNP and their Jamaat-i-Islami coalition.&nbsp; <O>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Dr. Humayun Azad recently
  wrote a book titled “Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad (the first line of the Pakistani
  national anthem).”&nbsp; In this book, he criticized the role of the
  Pakistanis and the pro-Pakistani collaborators during erstwhile East
  Pakistan.&nbsp; All the fundamentalist parties collaborated with the killer
  Pakistani regime at one time or other.&nbsp; Dr. Humayun Azad by exposing
  their misdeeds has made them very angry.&nbsp; By a stroke of luck the
  collaborators are ruling Bangladesh now. The goons of these fundamentalists
  and the collaborators of Pakistan are attacking the pro-liberation and
  liberal-minded intellectuals.&nbsp; All the pro-liberation political parties
  should unite against the ruling pro-Pakistani fundamentalists and the
  collaborators of Pakistan.&nbsp; The liberal people of the country should also
  condemn the heinous acts of the fundamentalist goons even though the
  government isn’t serious to root them out.&nbsp; How can they root out the
  fundamentalist goons? After all, they are patronizing the fundamentalists by
  sharing power with them. Therefore, the conscious people should raise their
  strong voices and condemn the brutal attacks on an eminent intellectual like
  Dr. Humayun Azad.<O>
