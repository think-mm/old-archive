	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As of late, Bangladesh has become a 
	safe haven for the Islamic fundamentalists under the aegis of government of 
	the four-party alliance consisting mainly of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), 
	Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), and Islami Unity Council (Islami Oykko Jote or IOJ)). 
	The major party BNP is the patron and the sustainer of all the 
	fundamentalist parties including JI and IOJ in Bangladesh. After the 
	independence in December 1971, the then government formed by Awami League 
	(AL) under the leadership of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman banned all 
	these Islamic parties to pave the way for Bangladesh to grow as a modern, 
	non-communal, progressive and secular country in the world. Unfortunately, 
	the killing of Bongobondhu by the killers and conspirators such as the 
	military dictator Gen. Ziaur Rahman created a vacuum of leadership in the 
	area of secular politics in Bangladesh. Later, the tragic killing of four 
	national leaders (belonging to AL) created more vacuum in the area of 
	secular front in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is hard to believe that a lower 
	ranking army major in 1971 became the President in 1976 and issued 
	proclamation after proclamation under martial law to change the secular 
	character of the constitution. The banned Islamic political parties such as 
	JI and many others like them came back through the patronization of the 
	founder of BNP, the military dictator Gen. Ziaur Rahman. Currently, the 
	party BNP under the leadership of the wife Mrs. Khaleda Zia of the deceased 
	dictator is ruling Bangladesh by sharing power with JI and IOJ. There are a 
	number of Islamic fundamentalist organizations (both political and 
	non-political) now exist in Bangladesh that share the same philosophy with 
	JI and IOJ. So, the other Islamic organization including the underground 
	ones are the natural allies of the current government of BNP-JI-IOJ. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the past, the patron BNP used to 
	come forward to give protection to the fundamentalists in Bangladesh. The 
	last government under AL emphasized the need to focus on the problem of 
	fundamentalism by acknowledging their existence in Bangladesh. It is 
	important to refresh our memory that the leaders of BNP then used to 
	ridicule and downplay the existence of the fundamentalists as claimed by the 
	last government under Sheikh Hasina. By doing this, they (BNP and their 
	fundamentalist allies) encouraged the extremists to carry out attacks mainly 
	on AL and other secular cultural organizations. Immediately after taking 
	over power in late October 2001, the coalition government of the 
	fundamentalist parties (BNP-JI-IOJ) used to be outrageous against any 
	criticism of the fundamentalist parties. They provided all sorts of cover up 
	and direct protection in the name of protecting the image of the country. 
	Their inaction and protection allowed the Islamic fundamentalists to 
	organize and continue their murderous activities more frequently. The latest 
	one is very severe that goes to show how organized they have become under 
	the protection of their patrons BNP-JI-IOJ. They demonstrated their ability 
	to attack the whole of Bangladesh synchronously. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Be mindful that the poisonous venom 
	of the fundamentalists have not grown in a short period of time. It was 
	reported that almost all of the fundamentalist cadres captured by the former 
	AL government were released and the cases against them were withdrawn. In 
	essence, the Islamist goons received impunity from the present government. 
	The government has stopped the trial on Udichi murder, Ramna killing, 
	Kotalipara bombs, Narayanganj bomblasts, etc. Some of these cases were 
	investigated and the culprits were under custody. However, the present 
	government chose to give cover up and protection to the fundamentalists. 
	They released almost all of them. As mentioned earlier, the military 
	dictator Gen. Zia chose to create and revive them. His wife Mrs. Zia has 
	chosen to let them grow through the protection of the government under her 
	party BNP in alliance with JI, and IOJ. The government under the leadership 
	of duo Mrs. Zia and war criminal Razakar Maulana Nizami did not bother even 
	to investigate the Jihadists, who were reported to come to Bangladesh after 
	they lost their paradise in Afghanistan. The government decided not to go 
	after the main criminals and perpetrators behind the arms smuggling, last 
	years grenade attack on AL chief, killing of former finance minister Mr. 
	Kibria, etc. They gave protection to Bangla Bhai and allowed his Jihadi 
	killings by denying even his existence. These are just a few blatant 
	examples of the government's inaction and giving cover up/protection to the 
	jihadi Islamic fundamentalists. Under pressure, they acted one time by 
	arresting a few of the fundamentalist goons and banning their organizations. 
	However, most of the newspapers reported that it was nothing but an arranged 
	fiasco. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, after the 8/17 blasts it is a 
	dangerous situation in Bangladesh. Indeed, what has happened is beyond 
	anyone's imagination. None thought that the terrorists would be doing to 
	such a level throughout Bangladesh just on a single day almost at a precise 
	time. Yesterday (August 17), the government spokesmen were trying to divert 
	and/or cover up despite the claims of the fundamentalists through their 
	leaflets. To Jamaat and BNP, AL is the main enemy. They have been busy all 
	these years to squeeze AL and protect the fundamentalists. So far, AL paid a 
	heavy price under the attacks of diehard fundamentalists, BNP, and company. 
	This time around, the pet snakes of BNP have expressed their anger for not 
	implementing Sharia through their leaflets. They have claimed the 
	responsibility for the blasts. However, as of yesterday, the government was 
	not willing to blame the fundamentalists. This role of the government has 
	frustrated even the politicians like Mr. Hasanul Haque Inu, Mr. Rashed Khan 
	Menon, et al. They are now blaming the BNP-Jamaat-IOJ government for the 
	present acts of terrorism.<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I understand how difficult the job 
	has become for the law enforcement agencies. A few of them are sincere to 
	get rid of the fundamentalists in the country. But they cannot extend their 
	investigation beyond a certain limit. Dr. Humayun Azad died a year ago as a 
	broken-hearted person because of attack on him by the fundamentalist goons. 
	The killer Maulanas threatened him even in the parliament. Could the 
	investigating officer interrogate those Maulanas? Did the government try to 
	find the goons who tried to slash the throat of the renowned professor? It 
	is in vain to ask the present government consisting of the fundamentalist 
	parties for bringing the culprits and their fundamentalist godfathers into 
	justice. The law enforcement agencies have captured a number of low-level 
	fundamentalists. They have acted due to the severity of the present 
	condition. The government will pass the peak hot period and then gradually 
	they will throw the process of investigation into the cold storage as they 
	have done before. The charade will continue ad infinitum. It would be a 
	matter of joy if this were not true but the past activities of the present 
	government would not make even a naive person to be optimistic. This 
	government has eroded their credibility through their own actions of denial 
	of the existence of the fundamentalists, suppression of the facts, and 
	collaboration with the disgruntled Islamic extremists. We should not be too 
	optimistic about the government of Khaleda Zia becoming sincere about 
	rounding up the Islamist criminals lest she lose the election that is 
	looming in the horizon. </font></p>
