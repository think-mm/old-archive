	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The astute observer of Bangladesh 
	politics please note down what the present interim government is saying to 
	appease the public. The chief of the caretaker government, Dr. Fakhruddin 
	Ahmed, has been repeatedly saying that the election will be held as soon as 
	possible for handing over power to the elected representatives. Whenever any 
	foreign delegate meets Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, he expresses his opinion about 
	the upcoming election as if it is his prime job. However, his cabinet member 
	Mr. Mainul Hosein gives a totally contradictory indication about the holding 
	of the parliamentary election. In fact, his comments indicate that the 
	roadmap to election is not so important. To him, the roadmap to democracy is 
	more important. It is rather difficult to fathom out how the roadmap to 
	democracy will be established without having a free and fair election as 
	early as possible. Be that as it may, the government in general and the 
	election commission in particular says that they need eighteen months to 
	hold the election. As it appear from the current situation the government 
	needs eighteen or so months for holding the free and fair election. With the 
	passage of time, it is becoming increasingly clear that the present “neutral 
	government” wants to implement their agenda prior to the holding of the 
	election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recent arrest of Mr. Jalil 
	indicates that the government wants to squeeze Awami League (AL) along with 
	Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to gradually implement its “minus two” 
	solutions. Under the “minus two solution,” the government not only wants to 
	eliminate the top two leaders but the two top parties out of power in the 
	next election. The general perception is that the political rhetoric of 
	Brig. (retd) Hannan Shah of BNP and Mr. Jalil of AL was the reason for their 
	fall from grace and eventual arrest. The government does not want to 
	tolerate any political statement/rhetoric of any existing parties at this 
	time before they see the party of their choice gets organized and take a 
	good shape to win it all in the upcoming election. Because of the brilliant 
	reporting of the private TV channel reporters, we could watch how the party 
	under the blessings of the government is taking a shape gradually. The 
	founders of the new party are holding meetings in restaurants and talking to 
	the media without getting into any trouble whatsoever even though the indoor 
	political activities are banned under the emergency rule. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As has been reported in many 
	newspapers, the new party or parties will be formed, which will be 
	transformed into a political front and most likely the front will become a 
	party under the blessings of the all-knowing caretaker advisors including 
	the chief advisor Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. This is nothing new to the people of 
	Bangladesh and Pakistan . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lest we forget, the history of a few 
	countries in this part of the world is replete with duplicities by ambitious 
	men in uniform. Gen. Ayub Khan, Gen. Ziaul Huq, Gen. Musharraf, Gen. Ziaur 
	Rahman, and Gen. Ershad did the same thing. They formed parties and imposed 
	it through a top-down process. The sunglass-clad military dictator Ziaur 
	Rahman beats all other military men in this vile game. After taking over 
	power through coup and counter coup he said initially that he had no desire 
	for politics. His only job was to hold a free and fair election. Then under 
	his blessings, various parties and fronts were formed, which were finally 
	transformed into BNP, a combination of pro-Chinese and pro-Pakistani leaders 
	who were looking for opportunities under the blessings of the government run 
	by the Military Bureaucracy Alliance (MBA). At this time, the government is 
	giving blessings indirectly and/or directly to the future party of their 
	choice. So far, the parties that were formed by the snobbish elites in the 
	past with the blessings of the special quarters did not bring anything good 
	for the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">History repeats itself. The present 
	political stand-off, conspiracies, and chaos are the results of those elite 
	conspirators, who formed the pet political parties by making “politics 
	difficult” not for the opportunists but for the real politicians. In fact, 
	the political opportunists and the conspirators get the scope of their 
	lifetime whenever the politics in Bangladesh becomes chaotic. They try to 
	fish in troubled water. For example, Mr. Ferdous Ahmed Qureshi is now 
	blatantly taking the opportunity for yet another time to create a new party. 
	In the past, he was with AL . From AL , he shook hands with Gen. Osmani and 
	formed Janata Paty. Later, he conspired against Gen. Osmani and shook hands 
	with Ziaur Rahman and took part in the formation of BNP. Before joining 
	military dictator Gen. Zia, he was a high ranking leader in Janata party (if 
	I recall correctly the name of the party) formed by Gen. Osmani. At the 
	present time, the same old Mr. Qureshi has become active one more time as we 
	observe. How can he miss the opportunity again to form a party with the 
	blessings of the powerful quarter? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people of Bangladesh in general 
	and many expatriate in particular are very skeptic and disappointed by the 
	mischievous steps taken by Dr. Fakhruddin’s government most likely under the 
	goading of the powerful quarter. They are allowing political activities of 
	the future parties (which will likely become a front and then will 
	metamorphose into a party of the political opportunists) of their choice but 
	arresting any other politicians, who are demanding for political activities 
	to the government. One thing is notably observed by the cautious analysts on 
	the activities of the present government of Bangladesh is that they are not 
	harassing and/or criticizing the fundamentalist parties such as 
	Jammat-i-Islami and Islamic Unity Council, which propagated Islamic 
	terrorism and militancy throughout Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By marginalizing the established 
	political parties, the present government will eventually form a party that 
	they will endorse. The existing big parties will be weakened and the new 
	party will come onto the surface. Most likely, the new party will get to the 
	power without any grassroots level support. In the mean time, the 
	fundamentalist parties like Jamaat-i-Islami will be left to grow even more 
	with their existing political strengths along with their underground (such 
	as Horkatul Jihad, Jadid Al-Qaeda, etc.) and over ground parties such as 
	Islami Unity Council, Katme Nobuwat, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under this dire backdrop what is the 
	future of the two dominant parties? The secularist and quasi-secularist 
	parties will become busy to protect themselves against the palace intrigue 
	of the military-backed government. As this happens it will create an 
	opportunity of lifetime for the fundamentalist parties such as 
	Jamaat-i-Islami and other similar religious parties to gain strength. This 
	is the history of the political game in the militarily ruled countries such 
	as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia. I wish someone could prove me wrong 
	but the present rise of the Islamic terrorists, Islamic fundamentalists, and 
	Islamic extremists is the result of the “minus two” solution in Pakistan. Is 
	the present caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed taking Bangladesh 
	in this direction following Pakistani model? It is my understanding that 
	Bangladesh with a great socio-political-economic potential will be ruined by 
	the game-plan of Dr. Fakhruddin’s government backed by the military. I wish 
	someone could prove me wrong by historical data and by intuition. </font>
