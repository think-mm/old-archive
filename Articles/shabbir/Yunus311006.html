	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the independence, it is for 
	the first time the people of Bangladesh have become united to express their 
	happiness for the winning of Nobel Prize by Dr. Yunus. Undoubtedly, he has 
	brought name and fame not only for him but also for the country. Especially, 
	Bangladesh was going through a huge image crisis in the last five years 
	under the rule of the government headed by Khlaeda Zia and Matiur Nizami of 
	Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-I-Islami (JI), respectively. 
	So, a good number of people have become little more happy for the good image 
	created by Dr. Yunus and his Grameen Bank. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is true that almost all the 
	people irrespective of their political identity became happy and 
	congratulated Dr. Yunus for making his way into the list of the Nobel 
	Laureates of the world. Having so much divergence in the political arena in 
	Bangladesh, here in the case of Dr. Yunus, the people of all different 
	opinions converged while congratulating him. So, to keep this unity, none 
	should try to bring Dr. Yunus into controversy by advocating for him to come 
	into politics or to takeover the charges of the caretaker government. In 
	fact, the over-enthusiastic admirers sometime damage the good name of noble 
	personalities in our part of the world. It is good that Dr. Yunus responded 
	negatively on the question of taking over power as the head of the caretaker 
	government. However, he expressed his desire for starting a new political 
	party. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As it appears, he does not find any 
	existing political party suitable for him to do politics by becoming a part 
	of them. His recent remarks indicate that the leaders of the existing 
	political parties are just a group of cantankerous people. Is the 
	quarrelsomeness of the politicians so simple to infer without proper 
	in-depth analysis? Is their no ideological divide among politicians? Most 
	notable is his eagerness to look for honest people for doing politics in 
	Bangladesh. We may observe in any country, the political parties and their 
	leaders often disagree on issues. In Bangladesh, the differences in opinions 
	are not coming to the level of issues related to education, economic 
	development, technological advancement, welfare supports, and other similar 
	matters. These are not been focused yet because there are more serious 
	problems the country is going through under the rule of war criminals of JI 
	and their patrons. Did the rule of JI, their godfathers, and the growth of 
	Islamic terrorists patronized by these forces in Bangladesh cause any 
	concern to Dr. Yunus? He appears to be silent on these core issues that may 
	undermine the existence of Bangladesh as a modern progressive country.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Yunus considers that the 
	politics is the problem against creating a poverty free Bangladesh. He does 
	not specifically say the political parties or the persons doing politics are 
	on his way against making Bangladesh a poverty-free country. It is true that 
	the poverty cannot be eradicated with so much problems in poltics. But, how 
	we can have a problem-free political environment without taking a clear 
	stand against those who are creating the problems. Especially, the clear 
	stand should be taken against the fundamentalist forces, their militant 
	terrorist wings, and their patrons/godfathers. After all, these are the real 
	problems Bangladesh (not only Bangladesh even the whole world) should 
	confront bravely. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh is not going through a 
	peaceful condition. The political violence is creating a new recod on a 
	daily basis. Especially, during the rule of the fundamentalist alliance 
	government, the attacks on secular intellectuals and politicians has 
	exceeded all the records of the past. Even the goverment allowed killings 
	through &quot;state-approved&quot; crossfire. Many high-profile killings took place by 
	the groups suspected to be aligned with the Khaleda-Nizami government. While 
	many concious people were on the forefront to protest the incidences, Dr. 
	Yunus surprisingly maintained his silence. For example, we did not hear his 
	concerns on the killing of his fellow economist, former finance minister, 
	and a former Under-Secretary General of UN, Mr. S. A. M. S. Kibria. On the 
	silence of Dr. Yunus on the political violence, Dr. Mozammel H. Khan wrote 
	as follows (in Mukto-Mona, October 21, 2006): </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Over the last several years the 
	battered human right situations of our dear homeland was of grave concerns 
	for many concious souls around the golbe. Oppression of minorities and 
	opposition workers, custodial torture and death, the brutal techniques of 
	custodial torture of politicians and intllectuals alike and probably the 
	most despicable of all crimes committed by the government that has been 
	termed by human rights organizations as &quot;terrorism by the State&quot; where 
	people are being killed on daily basis in the name of so-called &quot;crossfire,&quot; 
	absolutely disregarding the rule of law. Ironically, Dr. Yunus has been 
	totally mum on these reprehensible acts of a government that derived its 
	authority from a constitutional process. Even the mini Jalliwanwala Bagh 
	massacre of August 21, 2004 targeting the life of our former PM failed to 
	stimulate the conscience of Dr. Yunus to express any words of concern for 
	the drfeadful act.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The silence of Dr. Yunus after the 
	gruesome killing of Mr. S. A. M. S. Kibria has been criticized by Dr. 
	Mozammel H. Khan. He wrote as follows (in Mukto-Mona, October 21, 2006):
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;While Dr. Yunus has his blessings 
	on the civil society movement to elect honest and suitable candidates, he 
	has been totally silent when one of our brightest bureaucrat-turned 
	politicians has been killed by assassin's grenade. It was puzzling to note 
	the indifference of our gifted sons, even before he became a Nobel Laureate 
	vis-a-vis such a heinous crime and tragedy, who in time of the most crucial 
	juncture of our history took only a moment to decide his course of action 
	for the freedom of his motherland.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I agree with Dr. Mozammel H. Khan on 
	his analysis on the unexpected silence of Dr. Yunus on the hot political 
	issues and political crimes in Bangladesh. Dr. Yunus' support and his 
	endeavor for searching &quot;honest people&quot; in Bangladesh may create some hope 
	among a good number of gullible Bangalees of Bangladesh. Certainly, there 
	are honest people doing politics in Bangladesh. He should know by now who 
	are at the helm of corruption in different &quot;Bhabans.&quot; It should not be a 
	difficult task for him to know the neo-billionaires that amassed wealth 
	through corruption. Did Dr. Yunus say a single &quot;word&quot; on the reported 
	corruption of the prince-like individuals? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a Nobel Prize winner in &quot;peace,&quot; 
	he can work for enhancing peace and stability in Bangladesh by making his 
	position clear against the evil forces now active in politics. It is easy to 
	blame all the politicians. Anyone can do that in Bangladesh. There are many 
	individuals, who tactfully blame all the politicians only to conceal the 
	acts of the party that protect the vested interests of the class they belong 
	to. Of course, it takes courage and honesty to stand firm against the 
	political Mafias that ruled with support from the fascist JI and their 
	militant terrorist wings. Dr. Yunus should have the courage and firmness now 
	with all the strengths he has gained after winning the Nobel Peace Prize. 
	Before floating a new political party, he should prove his sincerity first 
	in promoting peace, stability, and honesty in politics in Bangladesh using 
	his influence in the future despite his controversial silence on the burning 
	political issues in the past. </font></p>
