	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A weekly newspaper editor and a 
	controversial columnist named Mr. Enayetullah Khan died a few weeks ago. In 
	the aftermath of his death a good number of people expressed condolences and 
	highlighted his glorious role as a brilliant columnist in Bangladesh. Of 
	course, he was a brilliant editor. But, it is really difficult to fathom out 
	whether he used his brilliance in supporting and enhancing democratic 
	processes for the progress of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the death of a person like Mr. 
	Enayetullah Khan, it is natural that people aligned with his philosophy will 
	highlight his good side and will glorify his persona with some exaggeration. 
	Those who are not philosophically aligned with him would remain silent and 
	even would go to the condolence meetings arranged for remembering him. In 
	general, people will deliver only good words to glorify an intellectual like 
	Mr. Enayetullah Khan. In the case of politicians, especially those belonging 
	to Awami League such as Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Taj Uddin Ahmed, 
	et al., there are exceptions. They are not remembered by all by highlighting 
	their positive contribution. Maybe, because they were politicians so they 
	are subjected to critical evaluations by their opponents, even by those who 
	claim to be neutral. In this respect, Mr. Enayetullah Khan should go through 
	some critical evaluations because he was a politician who joined hands with 
	two military dictators: Gen. Ziaur Rahman and Gen. Ershad. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The martial regimes of Pakistan and 
	Bangladesh created a group of pet intellectuals to advance their vicious 
	agenda to discredit the pro-democratic civilian politicians and the 
	conscious liberal intellectuals. To legalize their illegal takeover of power 
	and their dictatorial proclamations under the rule of martial law, they used 
	to hire a group of pet intellectuals and collaborators. In particular, the 
	hired (Varate) intellectuals and politicians used to create confusion among 
	the democratic forces, who were routinely subjugated by the brutal martial 
	regimes. In particular, the pet intellectuals used to glorify the takeover 
	of power of the fascist military rulers. To these hired (Varate) 
	intellectuals, the killings, and conspiracies of the military regimes were 
	justified. A case in point is the killing of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur 
	Rahman and the takeover of power finally by a military dictator named Ziaur 
	Rahman. A jubilant and ecstatic Enayetullah Khan wrote after the death of 
	Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and all but two of his entire family 
	members. In his article, he expressed his relief in a cynical way on the 
	death of Bongobondhu. In one place, he even resorted to satire and it hardly 
	bothered him to ridicule Bongobondhu as an actor. He did not have a trace of 
	humanly feeling for the gruesome murder of innocent individuals including 
	children and a pregnant woman in the night of August 15, 1975. It was 
	observed that people like Mr. Enayetullah Khan were waiting to get the 
	benefit out of the military rule that eventually followed like a nicely 
	scripted drama in the aftermath of the death of Bongobondhu. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Ray-ban clad military ruler, 
	Gen. Ziaur Rahman, finally took over power after about three months of the 
	death of Bongobondhu. He needed to hire a good number of so-called 
	intellectuals/editors to strengthen his power base and give a civil face to 
	his military rule. One of the hired intellectuals was Mr. Enayetullah Khan 
	who was anxiously waiting in the wing to be called by the army despot. He 
	became a minister under the military ruler Ziaur Rahman. The military ruler 
	Gen. Zia wanted to establish the fundamentalist parties namely 
	Jamaat-i-Islami, Muslim League, etc. in Bangladesh. These parties were 
	banned according to the separation of religion from politics under the 
	secularism principle of the constitution of Bangladesh. The hired scribes 
	like Mr. Enayetullah Khan were the collaborators of the military regime to 
	provide intellectual support for creating the present-day monster 
	Jamaat-i-Islami of Bangladesh. At one point in time, he (Mr. Khan) was 
	thrown out when the military dictator Ziaur Rahman did not find him useful 
	anymore. The dictator Ziaur Rahman had this habit of throwing away or even 
	killing people after using them for his purpose. An example is the arrest 
	and finally the killing of Col. Taher by Gen. Zia after using him for 
	ascending to the catbird seat of power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Enayetullah Khan later 
	collaborated with Gen. Ershad when the people of Bangladesh were trying to 
	get out of the nasty military rule. The opportunist Enayetullah Khan did not 
	hesitate to shake hands and get benefit from Gen. Ershad. He was appointed 
	an ambassador to China by the military dictator Gen. Ershad. In the past, he 
	provided support to the pro-military regime of Pakistan. In fact, it is 
	alleged that an agent of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the military rulers of 
	Pakistan named Muhammad Aslam was made the executive editor of Holiday by 
	Mr. Enayetullah Khan. The objective of this agent was to link up 
	pro-Pakistani elements of Bangladesh with the Pakistan Intelligence service 
	(source: &quot;Facts and Documents&quot; by Professor Abu Sayeed, page 66). This 
	information was revealed sometime in 1973. At one point, Mr. Enayetullah 
	Khan was arrested by the government at that time. But, he was able to get 
	release using his influence. Like a chameleon, he changed his color and 
	approached Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mr. Enayetullah Khan even 
	became an advisor to the President. According to his formula, the government 
	regulated the media in the post-liberation period in Bangladesh under BKSAL. 
	Mr. Enayetullah Khan again changed his color after the changeover of the 
	government through the killing of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his 
	family members excepting two daughters. He wrote article criticizing 
	Bongobondhu. He even wrote that Bongobondhu betrayed the people of 
	Bangladesh. In fact, he (Mr. Khan) himself conspired and betrayed the people 
	of Bangladesh by collaborating with the military dictators against the 
	constitution and the democratic process of Bangladesh. However, none of his 
	followers would talk about these episodes of infamy in their grief-stricken 
	pieces written solely to glorify him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The only saving grace for Mr. Khan 
	was the following conversion from Jamaat loving to Jamaat hating right 
	before his passing away. Mr. Enayetullah Khan wrote an article on the recent 
	rise of bomb attacks by the Islamic militants throughout Bangladesh while he 
	was recuperating from operation in Toronto. He criticized the fundamentalist 
	parties for the extremism of their underground cadres. Not too long ago, he 
	harshly criticized those who correctly predicted that the terror activities 
	of the militants in Bangladesh would accelerate as the days wore by. At long 
	last, Mr. Enayetullah Khan finally (a few days before his death) realized 
	the severity of the terrorist acts of the Islamists in Bangladesh. I wished 
	Mr. Enayetullah Khan would have lived longer and wrote more aggressively 
	against the Islamic terrorists, who were patronized and raised by the 
	military governments of Bangladesh (that he supported and collaborated with) 
	to redeem himself. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of Mr. Khan’s blind supporters 
	wrote that the departed editor was a brilliant analyst but they never 
	pointed out that he often supported the wrong cause. For example, he was no 
	lover of democracy when he aligned with two despotic regimes. Mr. Khan’s 
	persona thus was filled with hypocrisy of which French playwright Molière 
	said, &quot;Being a hypocrite has marvelous advantages!&quot; Late Enayetullah Khan 
	indeed had many advantages over his compatriots. </font></p>
