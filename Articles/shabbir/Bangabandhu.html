    Dear All,
  </div>
  <div>
  </div>
  <div>
    The black day for Bangalees have come again. It's a day for the Bangalees to
    mourn. The hyenas killed Bangabandhu and most of his family members on the
    black day of 15th August 1975. The killers didn't spare pregnant women,
    nine-year old children, and newly-wed house wives. The animals living in the
    jungle don't do such animalistic and cruel acts. These killers are even
    worst than the animals living in the jungle. I can't write anything more
    about the killers and their patrons because I don't want to degrade my level
    using words against these killer human beings having qualities less than the
    animals.

    Thanks to fatemolla for writing his <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/12339">Bangla
    essay</a> on our great founding father. I admire him for writing a short but
    an eloquent and powerful essay on Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

    I wrote an essay on Bangabandhu a few years ago. It was published in
    &quot;News from Bangladesh.&quot; I'm posting it again. The readers will
    find some information about this &quot;Great Poet of Politics - Bangabandhu
    and the Father of the Nation of the Bangalees.&quot;

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">The
    myopic supporters of the military dictators in Bangladesh always raise their
    voice against the one-party rule envisioned by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
    Rahman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>To undermine the democratic
    values of the founding father, these supporters of the military rulers use
    all sorts of threadbare arguments to show their disdain for him and in the
    process they only portray the last few months of his long political life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>These cynics hardly want to analyze the political contribution of
    Bangabandhu in a total perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>They
    interpret his politics based only on his few months of one-party rule that
    was not even materialized in any form, never mind its full-scale
    implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Readers may have
    noticed that if any political analyst sheds any historical truths about the
    military rule and the proponents of that Martial Ruler, then the anti-BKSALites
    rear their heads and they throw question regarding BKSAL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>While doing so, they spend no time with a deliberate attempt to
    conceal the heinous, unlawful acts of the military dictators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It's is a known tactic, which had worn out due to over usage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Should anyone justify the ruthless rule of the military dictators
    under martial law by questioning the one party rule of BKSAL?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Was it justified to have Martial Law under ruthless military
    dictators to replace the then one party rule of BKSAL?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>We all know that Soviet Union was under one-party communist rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The countries under the sphere of Soviet Union came out of one-party
    rule without imposing undemocratic Martial Law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>There is no example of it!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The process was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Evolutionary</i>
    not 'Revolutionary' as it was the case with Kurmotola-based conspiracy under
    the aegis of a Major General and his ilk who suddenly became the champion of
    universal suffrage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was a blatant
    lie and the supporters of the vile general know it too well!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The 'freedom' loving Bengali nationalists did not have to depend on a
    ruthless military dictator (with all powers in his hands) to transform them
    from one-party quasi 'communist' or 'socialist' rule to a multi-party
    democracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The vicissitudes of time
    would have done it a la dismantling of Reagan's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Evil
    Empire</i>, the Soviet Union and her allies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>No military leaders have to sweat for this conversion, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">The
    criticisms on the ephemeral one-party rule by the critics of Bangabandhu are
    rather harsh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One should not exclude
    his long struggle for democracy during more than two decades of his
    political life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>To establish
    democracy and non-communal secular politics in Pakistan, he fought
    relentlessly with the people against the military junta and the political
    Islamists of Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Lest we
    forget, these two forces shook hand to drive out the vestiges of secularism
    from Jinnah's Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Should I
    remind everyone one more time that Bangabandhu spent prime times of his life
    (more than a decade, about twelve years) in jail for establishing the
    democratic rights of the majority Bangalees in Pakistan? No one has to
    fabricate these facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>All is there
    in any archives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The fervid critics
    and faultfinders of Bangabandhu have to do some legwork to find those
    records in old newspapers in Dhaka and that is all!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Furthermore, a Bangalee does not need to be an ardent Awami Leaguer
    or a political scientist or a historian to fathom out his sufferings and
    contributions in the democratic movements in Pakistan especially in the
    sixties when the nation was griped by the military General such as FM Ayub
    Khan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>How could the self-professed
    Bangalee historians become amnesiac all of a sudden?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span><o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">As
    the head of the government, Bangabandhu had to bring tranquillity through
    improvement of law and order in the war-ravaged nation of 75 millions in the
    early days of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The
    government was reluctant to involve army in restoring internal law and order
    because of the bitter experiences of Pak Army's interference in taking over
    power from the civilian government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>So,
    to support the police forces, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> was formed. Even civilized nation such as America has National
    Guard to serve the nation when every county in America has police force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It is ridiculous to see that few critics very often equate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> with the Gestapos of Nazis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>How
    come they do not equate America's National Guard or Canadian Mounties to be
    a variant of Hitler's Gestapos?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Any
    thoughts on this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>After the
    independence, there was this necessity of employing a good number of young
    energetic freedom fighters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>No one
    wanted to see roving bandits of ex-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mukti
    Bahini</i> members terrorizing the villagers with their arms hanging by
    their neck and shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was a
    smart move of Bangabandhu to bring these armed men under his fold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The nation was spared from absolute lawlessness and mayhem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Thus, it was decided collectively by all concerned in the defense and
    home ministry to form a paramilitary force named <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> to support both the army and police to maintain some semblance of
    law and order in the aftermath of our hard fought independence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>We should never forget that most of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> members were the members of the freedom fighting forces, not the
    members of the Gestapo type forces as few of the critics may hopelessly try
    to label them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The same group of
    critics propagated that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> was made superior to army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>If
    the intention of the government was really that to happen, then the tanks
    used during the midnight massacre in the mid-August of 1975 would have been
    given to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi Bahini</i> to protect
    Bangabandhu and his inner circle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Of
    course, many members of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi
    Bahini</i> committed excesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But,
    the critics of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Rakkhi Bahini</i> keep
    mum in respect of the excesses committed by the army under martial law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>They do not equate the army with the Gestapo for their excesses
    during the Martial Law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I think none
    of these forces should be equated with the Gestapo of Nazis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Our law enforcement agency people did not and do not have yet a good
    sense of restraint while carrying out their duties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>They need continuing improvement and training suitable for enforcing
    laws in a civilized, democratic country. <o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">It
    will always be mind boggling for anyone to rationalize why Bangabandhu,
    despite his long struggle for democracy, adopted a one-party rule after
    about only three years of our independence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bangabandhu
    took over the charges of the war-ravaged country in 1972 at a time when the
    country was mostly in a ruin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One
    should give credit to the then government under his the leadership for
    preventing famines in 1972 and 1973 in the newly independent Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>But, he was unable to prevent the manmade famine in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The critics and the political opponents are critical to Bangabandhu,
    the then food Minister Late Foni Bhushan Majumder, and Awami League
    leaders/workers for that unwanted famine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bangabandhu
    and his party had to pay very dearly for that famine of 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>But, it is important to note that the then secretary of the food
    Ministry 'Abdul Momen Khan' did not have to pay any price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>He was rewarded later after the death of Bangabandhu in 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>He was made the Food Minister by the military dictator Ziaur Rahman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It was revealed that the Food Secretary 'Abdul Momen Khan' and few
    other bureaucrats convinced Bangabandhu and his cabinet in purchasing rice
    from USA with the argument to establish and improve trade relation with the
    USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bangabandhu wanted to improve
    relation with the USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But, there
    were conspiracies behind his back, which he could not predict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Finally, at a critical time, when the US government did not allow
    shipment of rice to Bangladesh, he became helpless in tackling the already
    ensuing famine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He, the then Prime
    Minister, a great loving and caring leader of the Bangalees, cried openly in
    the cabinet meeting for his inability and helplessness in tackling the
    unwanted famine in 1974 (source: 'Facts and Documents' by: Professor Abu
    Sayeed, page 60).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Our leader became a

    </span>Despite opposition of many US leaders and people, the US government
    supported the Pakistani military junta for no good reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span>Bangabandhu maintained a multiparty-based open democratic system with

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">We
    should never blame Bangabandhu for taking our new republic under the fold of
    Soviet-India nexus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bangabandhu being
    an all time activist for establishing democracy tried his level best to link
    Bangladesh with other democracies of the globe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Therefore, contrary to all those misinformation campaigns done by the
    ilk of military junta Bangladesh was not a communist country, after all. In
    addition, Bangabandhu did not get support from the democratic superpower
    that he deserved in enhancing democracy in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Instead, he was discredited for the famine in 1974 that he could have
    averted if he were not eager to enhance relationship with the USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>So, that was a turning point for him to take a side in the ever
    polarized world at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>No
    country in the seventies was truly a free nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The vicious power play by the two superpowers polarized every nation
    on earth into two camps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is rather
    unfortunate that Bangladesh was reluctantly lumped with the group that had
    no access to staples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>

    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">In
    a helpless and hapless situation, Bangabandhu adopted the Soviet model of
    one party rule at a time when Bangladesh did not have a strong opposition
    party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The opposition parties with
    insignificant support of the people were either the underground miscreants
    or overground revolutionaries with arms to establish different forms of
    socialism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The parliament was not
    divided with strong opposition as it is now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>His party, the Awami League, won 167 out of 169 seats in 1973
    election in the then East Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In
    that year, his party lost (probably) more than 10 seats in parliament (it is
    ridiculous to notice that few critics compare this election with the one
    held in 1978 under martial law aimed at legitimizing a sitting military
    ruler) maintaining more than two-third majority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>So, there was no resistance from a legitimate strong opposition
    against bringing the country under one-party rule through constitutional
    amendment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In doing that, he did not
    conspire or stage a coup or put pressure or kill anyone to grab the post of
    President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One can notice that Gen.
    Osmany and Barrister Moinul Hussain disagreed with Bangabandhu on the
    question of BKSAL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>None were
    imprisoned for their disagreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Lawfully,
    Bangabandhu explained the reasons then for an urgent need of constitutional
    amendment to the Speaker and to the House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>At
    one point, he said in his speech in parliament on 25<sup>th</sup> January
    1975:<o:p>

    must bring discipline in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Mr.
    Speaker, very sadly, we had to consider making this amendment in the
    constitution. '. ' ' Mr. Speaker, I was a member and leader of this house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>I feel sad that I will not be able to remain a member of this house
    anymore.' (translation mine; source: 'Bangabandhur Bhashon' edited by

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">The
    above statements indicate that introduction of one-party rule was not an
    outcome of his inner political philosophy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He
    did it at a time when internal stability of the country was at risk because
    of the open and outright hostile declarations of most of the then (minor)
    opposition parties (such as Jatio Samajtantrik Dal's armed Gono Bahini,
    Armed Sarbahara Party, etc.) for armed struggle to overthrow the legitimate
    government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There were killings on
    all sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The miscreants killed four
    ruling party parliament members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Internationally,
    the democratic superpower did not cooperate and help his government that he
    deserved for advancing democracy after 1971 in Bangladesh and even before
    1971 as the Prime Minister-elect of Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The internal and international situation during that time of Cold War
    era compelled him to take a side after famine in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Contrary to his stand with a long history of his struggle for
    democracy, he adopted one-party based model only after 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>All he did was to bring stability and tranquillity for the people
    that he loved so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>His long
    struggles with readiness for sacrificing his life for establishing the
    rights of the Bangalees are historical facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The overwhelming support and mandate of the people he earned through
    all his sacrifices and efforts were the major causes of his overconfidence
    in taking steps that he deemed beneficial to the country at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Therefore, we should factor in all these points before we vilify
    Bangabandhu for ushering one-party rule in the newly born republic of
    Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">It
    comes as no surprise that critics of Bangabandhu try to highlight only the
    political aspect of one-party rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But,
    all his critics and even many of his supporters ignore the pragmatic steps
    he took in decentralizing administration, reforming administration, and in
    augmenting agricultural production with the new system he introduced in
    1975.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Not many of his colleagues
    revealed different aspects of his pragmatic programs that he started in
    early 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Mr. Mahbubur Rahman was
    one of the few bureaucrats who wrote extensively about Bangabandhu's
    programs in his memoir '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Kichu Sriti
    Kichu Driti</i>' published in 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He
    worked directly in close contact with Bangabandhu both as a cabinet
    secretary and as an establishment secretary during all the years till the
    death of Bangabandhu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He is one of
    the few bureaucrats critical to the bureaucratic systems in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>I have extracted most of the following information from his book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>One should know that he was not an Awami Leaguer or was not an
    appointee of the Awami League government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He
    was probably the last bureaucrat who joined Bengal Civil Service probably in
    the waning days of British Raj<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">Bangladesh
    is not a big country to divide based on autonomous provinces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>But, the huge population (the population of our many districts is
    even more than the total population of countries like Sweden, Denmark, etc.)
    entails employing a decentralized administration under a form of autonomous
    body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bangabandhu wanted to do just
    that by bringing district administration under an elected Governor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The district administration under the Governor was supposed to do all
    the development works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Even now, a
    small irrigation project or a small bridge project in Sunamganj needs to be
    approved by all levels of bureaucrats locally in the district and centrally
    in different ministries in Dhaka including finance ministry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Bangabandhu and his government desperately wanted to curtail that
    process through decentralization by giving all these powers to the governing
    council under a governor in a district.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>For
    the district level projects, the central government would provide only
    financial support to the district administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>By doing that, the role of bureaucrats in the secretariat at Dhaka
    would have been brought to a minimum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The
    hindrances caused by the red tapes in the secretariat at Dhaka would have
    been removed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The governors with a
    governing council were given authorities to formulate and implement
    development activities in their respective districts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>One does not need to be a political scientist to understand that the
    system was introduced to empower the bureaucrats of the Secretariat Building
    in Segun Bagicha, Dhaka, but to ensure a decentralized autonomous district
    administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">On
    the agriculture sector, Bangabandhu exerted his all out efforts to overcome
    food deficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He did his politics
    from and at the grass root level in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>He knew well about the poor economic conditions of the farmers in the
    villages of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>So, the plan
    was that the government would provide machineries and other resources
    through a cooperative framework in the villages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>All those massive plans were undertaken to improve the conditions of
    the people in the villages of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In
    1974, the government ordered to cultivate every inch of land in Bangladesh
    to increase food production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>For
    that, most of the government lands were brought under cultivation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>One can remember that most of the unused lands of colleges, schools,
    and government organizations were cultivated in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>By doing all these, in early 1975, Bangladesh was able to develop a
    sufficient food stock despite flood in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It was amazing how people trusted and listened to the words of
    Bangabandhu and worked hard during a short span of his rule.<o:p>

    of his programs were abandoned, though, by the military regimes through
    anti-BKSAL propaganda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Gen. Ershad
    took a portion of Bangabandhu's concept of decentralized administration by
    upgrading Thanas to Upozillas in a distorted fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>While Bangabandhu gave full power to the peoples' representatives in
    the district, but, Gen. Ershad kept Deputy Commissioner above the Upozilla
    Chairman in the district.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One can see
    that Bangabandhu genuinely wanted to decentralize and upgrade district
    administration first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Then he wanted
    to plan for upgrading Thana administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>As
    he said in a speech given in Bangabhaban:<o:p>

    is noticeable that the Upazilla administration, introduced by Gen. Ershad

    government for no valid reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The
    present government is yet to revive the Upazilla administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It is hard to imagine how long will it take for Bangladesh to

    writing is not intended to elevate Bangabandhu to a superhuman level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>He made mistakes because he did try to do some works to modify and
    upgrade the colonial-type bureaucratic administration with an aim to improve
    the conditions of the people of Bangladesh that he loved more than himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Before 1971, he was the majority party leader of Pakistan and the
    most popular leader of the then East Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>After 1971, the Bangalees regarded him as someone more than a Prime
    Minister or a President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He could
    remain as a 'King Maker' without involving himself in administering the
    country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>His thoughts on policies
    would have been implemented even if he were not a Prime Minister or a
    President.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Or, he could have
    implemented his decentralization policies without going through the
    ill-fated one-party rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was and
    still is important for Bangabandhu to remain above controversies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>A non-controversial Bangabandhu is important for the pro-liberation,
    liberal, and secular forces in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In
    a strict and absolute sense, he was not a completely secular political
    leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But, relatively speaking, he
    was a great secular leader who promoted secularism by forbidding politics in
    the name of religion in independent Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>His non-communal pragmatic political activities with secular views
    helped aware Bangalees against the communal political Islamists even before
    1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>His hard work at the grass root
    level (with the support of the secular forces) was the key factor for the
    defeat of the communal political Islamists in the then East Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>By including secularism in the constitution of Bangladesh after 1971,
    he helped create a wide platform for the liberal secularists to grow in
    Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><font size="3">Since
    Bangabandhu was a politician and a former head of the government, he will be
    criticized and evaluated in all the years to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>There is nothing wrong in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I
    do not think that the historians and chronicler<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>should not criticize because he is dead and not here on this earth to
    defend himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Similarly, I also do
    not think that the critics should remain silent since his maker will judge
    him after reincarnation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The question
    arises when certain individuals deliberately undermine him without giving
    due credit to him for his long struggle for democracy and for the
    emancipating Bangalee nation from the clutches of Punjabis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Few pro-military critics of Bangabandhu try to equate him (as a
    democrat) with a military dictator who came to power through backdoor with
    the 'able' help of conspiracy, coup, and killing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Bangabandhu underestimated the sweet-talking and the fulsome army
    general by taking him in his administration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>After 1975, the conspirator military General overestimated him by
    exerting his efforts to become another Bangabandhu of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The name of Bangabandhu was even forbidden in government media by the
    conspirator general and his successors. To materialize his dream his stooges
    in the government actively suppressed the history of our liberation war and
    the contribution Bangabandhu Sheik Mujibur Rahman made for his impoverished
    people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>By disregarding the policies
    of Bangabandhu they even tried to take Bangladesh back into a centralized
    Pakistan style government under the clutches of
    military-theocracy-bureaucracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Above
    all, BKSAL minus one party rule is something that Bangladesh still needs to
    implement for a decentralized people-oriented administration that will
    result in nothing but dynamism, prosperity, and growth for the impoverished
    125 million people who still call Bangladesh their home</font></p>
