	<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080">By: <a href="index.html">Shabbir 
	Ahmed</a> </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The people of Bangladesh were 
	repressed and subjugated by the Pakistani military rulers and their cohort 
	Islamists in 1971. They invoked various aspects of Islam to justify mass 
	murder, rapes, and torture of Bengalis. The political Islamists used Islam 
	to commit genocidal crimes. I myself saw and observed the severity of crimes 
	committed against the Bengalis in general and the minority Hindus in 
	particular. All the crimes were justified in the eyes of most of the Mullahs 
	and their allied fundamentalist forces. Many Bengalis still remember the 
	crimes of the political Islamists even after thirty four years of the 
	independence of Bangladesh. Here I am writing a few of the atrocities that I 
	saw in 1971. First of all, I am giving a brief background information on the 
	conflicts created by the Pakistani military and their Islamist cohorts.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh, whose name used to be 
	East Pakistan, was a part of Pakistan till December 16, 1971. In East 
	Pakistan (now Bangladesh), the movement for liberal democracy (against 
	military and theocratic rule of Pakistan) grew very fast since late 50s of 
	the last century. In this movement, the intellectuals and the liberal 
	politicians of all secular parties in general and the political leaders of a 
	major political party Awami League in particular, contributed to mobilize 
	public opinion in favor of democratic movement in a Muslim majority East 
	Pakistan. As one can understand that the intellectuals can write and create 
	a wave on an issue among the conscious section of the population of a 
	country but ultimately there should be the political leaders having clear 
	political agenda to carry forward the messages to the grass root level. The 
	people of East Pakistan were fortunate enough to have a charismatic 
	political leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (we lovingly call him “Bongobondhu” 
	meaning a friend of Bengal), who wholeheartedly wanted liberal democracy and 
	separation of Islam from politics as opposed to Islamic theocracy, 
	fundamentalism, and military rule in the then Pakistan. He popularized 
	secular democratic values in East Pakistan – an overwhelmingly Muslim 
	majority province of Pakistan. The nation was under the military rule of 
	Gen. Ayub Khan till 1969. Then another military man, Gen. Yahya Khan, took 
	over the power and promised to establish democracy through adult franchise.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In December 1970, a free and fair 
	election was held throughout the nation. In this election, Bongobondhu 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s party Awami League won 167 out of 300 parliamentary 
	seats in the entire Pakistan. His party got 167 seats (out of 169 seats) 
	from East Pakistan but did not get a single seat from West Pakistan (now 
	Pakistan). Compared to East Pakistan, the intellectuals and the political 
	leaders in West Pakistan were way behind in promoting secular liberal 
	democratic values. So, there were sharp differences in the vision and 
	mindset between the people of East and West Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The victory of Bongobondhu Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League did not bode well with the military rulers 
	from West Pakistan. Besides, the Islamic fundamentalist parties including 
	Jamaat-i-Islam of Pakistan and Muslim League were not all that thrilled to 
	see a secularist party such as Awami League literally knocking at the door 
	to assume the power to rule the entire of Pakistan. Furthermore, the 
	military in power thought that the establishment of liberal democracy would 
	undermine the unlimited power the military had in those days in Pakistan. 
	Whereas, the Islamic fundamentalists thought that the establishment of 
	secular democracy by Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s Awami League would 
	seriously jeopardize the Islamists dream for a totalitarian Islamic Shariah 
	rule in Pakistan. Therefore, both the military and the Islamic 
	fundamentalist parties of Pakistan joined hands to deny handing over power 
	to Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and to his party Awami League even 
	though they got clear mandate to rule Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At one point, on 25th March, 1971 
	the military in power under President Gen. Yahya Khan overturned the 
	election results and cracked down on unarmed Bengalis (people of East 
	Pakistan) for supporting and voting Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 
	his party the Awami League. In the night of 25th March, they killed tens of 
	thousands of people in Dhaka city alone by targeting minority Hindus, 
	students, Awami League supporters, and young men/women. They immediately 
	arrested Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and took him to a jail in West 
	Pakistan, which is thousand miles away from East Pakistan. Later, they 
	continued their operation throughout East Pakistan for nine months. Millions 
	of people were displaced and about ten million people took shelter as 
	refugees in the neighboring provinces of India. The elected leaders of Awami 
	League had no other choice but to form a government in exile in India and 
	start a freedom struggle for the marginalized population of East Pakistan.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most hideous development however 
	was the joining of the Islamic fundamentalists with the Pakistan army in 
	wanton killing, raping, torture, and extortion of the Bengalis. They said 
	that they were protecting Islam and Pakistan, both from becoming extinct in 
	East Pakistan. Many of the Mullahs justified the killings and rapes 
	mentioning the rulings in Qur’an (verses of God) and Hadith (sayings of 
	Prophet Muhammad). All the fundamentalist forces came together and they 
	organized to form Islamic paramilitary militia forces with the support and 
	training given by the Pakistan military in power. Three main forces they 
	formed were: Razakars, Al-Badars, and Al-Shams. Razakars were composed of 
	the fundamentalist members and supporters from the whole country. Al-Badars 
	and Al-Shams were mainly the members of the student wing of the 
	fundamentalist party Jamaat-e-Islami headed by the political leaders Maulana 
	Abul Ala Moududi (now deceased), and many ideologues of Moududi such as 
	Golam Azam (retired, living comfortably in Bangladesh), Maulana Matiur 
	Rahman Nizami (currently a Minister in Bangladesh), and few other Bengali 
	Islamists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The members of Razakar, Al-Badar, 
	and Al-Shams forces were trained by Pakistan army just like Talibans of 
	Afghanistan. They could kill anyone if they deemed them to be an enemy of 
	Islam or of Pakistan. They carried out this brutal operation till our 
	independence on 16th December 1971. During the turbulent nine-month period 
	in 1971, the Pakistan army and the Islamic Militia forces could investigate 
	anyone to check whether he knew the four basic Kalemas (Kalema means the 
	pledge or allegiance to Allah and Muhammad, which every good Muslim must 
	know by heart). According to a fundamentalist Muslim, one cannot be a good 
	Muslim unless one could recite those Kalemas in Arabic uninterruptedly. That 
	was not all. Everyone had to wear Islamic cap (called “tupi” in Bangladesh) 
	to show the army and their allied Islamic militia that he was a Muslim. Just 
	for being Hindu was a crime of the century! Many Hindus who could not flee 
	to India were thus killed. Many supporters of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 
	Awami League who could not hide and/or flee to India were killed as well to 
	keep Islam and Pakistan intact. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1971, on one day, I was riding a 
	bus. The bus was halted by Pakistan army and Razakars. Before the bus could 
	come to a dead stop, the driver instructed everyone to wear Islamic cap and 
	memorize the four Kalemas of Islam in Arabic. The first Kalema, which is 
	better known as Kalema Taiyeb in Arabic, is “La Ilaha Illallahu Muhammadur 
	Rasulullah” meaning “there is no other God but Allah and Muhammad is His 
	Prophet.” I remember quite well the terror and tremor in the bus. Everyone 
	was panicked and terrified and couldn’t wear the cap properly because then 
	all of us were terrified and our hands were constantly in tremor. We were 
	ordered to get down from the bus. We approached one-by-one. We had to recite 
	the Kalemas. A Pakistan army and few Razakars asked everyone whether we were 
	Muslims. Fortunate for us, all the passengers could say the Arabic pledges 
	and we were allowed to board the bus and resume our journey. I still could 
	remember seeing few hapless persons handcuffed (probably from another bus) 
	on one side. I heard people saying that most probably those unfortunate ones 
	couldn’t utter the Islamic pledges and they failed to prove that they were 
	Muslims. In those turbulent days, this could have been a horrendous crime in 
	the eyes of the brute Pakistani military and their Islamist allies. A harsh 
	death penalty was given to many who failed to prove that they were Muslims. 
	Many Hindus started memorizing the four Arabic pledges of Islam just to save 
	their neck. The Pakistan army and Islamic militia forces came to know about 
	this later. So, they started checking whether they were circumcised like 
	Muslims even though they were able to recite the Kalemas. Therefore, it was 
	rather difficult for a Hindu to escape death from the Pakistan army and 
	Islamic militia forces in 1971 inside East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I still remember the mass scale 
	massacre of Hindus of a small village called “Naria” near Moulvibazar, in 
	the northeastern part of Bangladesh. Pakistan army in cohort with the 
	Islamic paramilitary forces (“Razakars”) attacked all the Hindu families of 
	that village. I was living with my Aunt’s family at the time in a 
	neighboring village. I still remember the heartfelt crying of one Hindu 
	survivor “Mr. Nolini,” whose all family members were killed by the Pakistan 
	army and Razakar Islamists. He survived because he became unconscious (and 
	that’s why he survived) probably a second before the army and the Islamic 
	forces shot bullets from the machine guns on the columns in which all the 
	members of his family were lined up by the army. Mr. Nolini was probably in 
	his early 60s and was recovered by the neighboring villagers from the pool 
	of blood of his near and dear ones. He was brought by the sympathizers to my 
	Aunt’s house where I was living. My Aunt’s husband was a friend of Mr. 
	Nolini. As the only survivor, he was crying and regretting the following day 
	by saying why he was not being killed by the Pakistan army and by the 
	fundamentalist forces. What we came to know was that he felt unconscious 
	(probably a second before the army and the fundamentalist forces opened fire 
	from the machine guns) when he saw every one of his family including his 
	little grandson crying and waiting for imminent deaths standing on the 
	columns. About thirty members of his near and dear ones (his sons and their 
	families and others) were mercilessly killed in that village in one evening 
	sometime in April/May of 1971. Everyone standing there (including myself) 
	cried after seeing the gentleman the following morning. Still, it is hard 
	for me to check my tears whenever I remember that old gentleman rolling on 
	the ground for the loss of his near and dear ones. The villagers later tried 
	to help him to flee to India because they figured that the army and the 
	Razakar Islamists would come back and would even kill those who helped Mr. 
	Nolini, a Hindu. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Pakistan army and Islamic 
	paramilitary forces raped many girls and women. Most of the religious 
	leaders or Maulnas were the patrons and supporters of the killers and the 
	rapists. Many of them were even the perpetrators of all these heinous 
	crimes. At that time, I even heard them saying in Mosques that the proper 
	actions by Pakistan military against Hindus helped protect Islam in East 
	Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The Pakistan army and theirs allied religious 
	forces captured Bengali girls and women mostly from the minority Hindu 
	community. Many army officers captured the Bengali women to keep them as 
	“pleasure girl.” Most of the Mullahs justified these types of acts as Mut’a 
	marriage (temporary marriage) approved by Islam. To them, it was perfectly 
	okay because the Muslim Pakistan soldiers and their allied religious forces 
	rescued Pakistan from the enemies of Pakistan and Islam. So, according to 
	them, the women captured by these forces were Halal (meaning okay according 
	to Islamic law) as spoils of the war. Many Mullahs were not even shameful at 
	all in giving their edict in public meetings in favor of the Islamic 
	paramilitary forces and Pakistan army. I asked a few times to Mullahs in 
	Bangladesh about the torture on Hindus and liberal Muslims by the Islamic 
	paramilitary forces. In reply, these Mullahs tried to cover up and defend 
	shamelessly. I observed similar attitude among many so-called Islamic 
	thinkers (not Mullahs but western-educated defenders of Islam). A disgruntle 
	Mullah named Maulana Abul Ala Moududi of Pakistan supported all the torture 
	on minority Hindus and liberal Muslims by allowing his party Jamaat-I-Isami 
	in forming different paramilitary forces. In the whole Muslim world, this 
	Maulana is regarded as an Islamic scholar. In response to my strong 
	criticisms, many times I was reminded by the Islam-oriented Bengalis about 
	the scholarly works of this killer Mullah Moududi on Islam. I started 
	questioning: where did Mullah Moududi get inspiration to let his party take 
	part in genocidal crimes against Hindus and liberal Muslims? Did this 
	scholar get inspiration from the scriptures that he knew so well? Inspired 
	by Maulana Moududi, almost all the Mullahs supported and/or defended the 
	genocide of Bengalis in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many Mullahs took active part in the 
	killings. For example, Maulana Delwar Hussain Saidee (a current parliament 
	member in Bangladesh from Jamaat-I-Islami) and Maulana Matiur Rahman Nizami 
	(a current minister in Bangladesh from Jamaat-I-Islami) are two among many, 
	who were wanted by police for their crimes after the independence of 
	Bangladesh. The crimes committed by the political Islamists in 1971 was 
	severe. There were innumerable number of incidences of torture, brutality, 
	killings, and rapes committed by the Pakistan army and the Islamist Fifth 
	Columnist of the then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). During the last 
	three/four days of our independence war, these forces killed many secular 
	Bengali intellectuals including university professors, journalists, doctors, 
	newspaper editors, and others before their surrender in December 16, 1971. 
	After the independence of Bangladesh, the government banned all the 
	religious (read Islamic) political parties according to constitutional law 
	to separate state from the Mosque. That was sufficient of crime for 
	Bangladesh for not being recognized by not only Saudi Arabia but also by 
	many Islamic nations of the globe. Through a tragic coup, the government was 
	changed on August 15, 1975. Does this surprise anyone that Saudi Arabia 
	recognized Bangladesh immediately after the change of the government? A 
	military dictator named Gen. Ziaur Rahman came to power by a stratagem. He 
	immediately deleted the article of separation of religion from politics from 
	the constitution. He even allowed Islamic political parties to grow and 
	function. In a planned way, the Islamic politics and the allied parties were 
	brought to the surface by changing the secular constitution of Bangladesh. 
	The constitution was changed later to make Islam as the state religion of 
	Bangladesh. Now, two of the fundamentalist parties (Jamaat-e-Islami and 
	Islami Oikko Jote (Islami Unity Council)) are sharing power in an alliance 
	with two other semi-Islamic parties. In 1972, we started as a pragmatic 
	liberal secular state but now with time we are going down under the 
	influence of political Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many intellectuals, progressive 
	democracy-loving young men/women, and minorities sacrificed their lives in 
	the hands of the brutal political Islamists with a dream to have a 
	non-communal Bangladesh for all irrespective of their religious identities. 
	But, the political Islamists extended their base through Madrasas, Islamic 
	non-government organizations, and Islamic charities. Gradually, they have 
	gained strength to share government power. Still, their militant cadres are 
	killing respected secular people. Many minority men/women have been tortured 
	and killed since they took over power after the election in 2001. The 
	secularization of Bangladesh, which happened rapidly in 1972 with our 
	independence was replaced by the gradual Islamization. All indications are 
	there that this nation of 140 million people will become another 
	fundamentalist Islamic nation a la Afghanistan unless we start re-educating 
	our people by showing the gross inanities in Political Islam, which is 
	thwarting all the progress in the nation and above all taking the people of 
	Bangladesh to a journey backwards in time. </font></p>
