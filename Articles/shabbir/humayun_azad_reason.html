  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">The
  secular people of Bangladesh have lost a great voice and an uncompromising
  intellectual of our time.&nbsp; Dr. Humayun Azad did not compromise on his
  views, principle, and philosophy.&nbsp; He stood tall against all the
  obscurantists including fascist political Islamists; he was ready to wage a
  war against them using his mighty pen. &nbsp;The late professor threatened
  them and their old-age ideology with his powerful pen.&nbsp; However, the
  political hyenas of Islamic origin threatened him by their “blunt” knives.&nbsp;
  These hyenas knew that they would not be able to kill the philosophy of Dr.
  Azad merely by writing any inordinate amounts of articles.&nbsp; Instead of
  using pens, the political Islamists chose to use knives to kill him.&nbsp;
  They failed in their aggressive and well-planned attack.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
  they did not give up.&nbsp; The hyenas generally do not give up so easily.&nbsp;
  The hyenas of political Islam are not exceptional compared to their species,
  which live in the jungle.&nbsp; &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">The
  political Islamists continued their threats both directly and indirectly.&nbsp;
  Newspaper pages were filled with stories that will testify my assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>One of the local vernacular newspapers, Inquilab, took the lead in this
  villainous effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">To
  inflict pain on the poet cum essayist, the vile gang even tried to abduct his
  son and threatened to kill his whole family.&nbsp; All these were happening in
  a country where there was a government in power.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a big
  part of the government is under the control of the political Islamists in
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; Therefore, the hyenas were fearless and were actively
  pursuing their agenda to keep Dr. Azad under mental stress.&nbsp; In fact, he
  did not get the time and opportunity to recover mentally and physically from
  the severe attack that the political Islamists unleashed upon him only 5
  months ago.&nbsp; I understand that he left for Germany very recently to do
  research on nineteenth century German romantic poet Heinrich Heine.&nbsp; I'm
  sure that he was worrying for his loved ones whom he left behind in
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; He was worrying for the well being of his wife, for his
  daughters, and for his son.&nbsp; In a lonely and desolate environment, he was
  passing last few days of his life with no peace in his mind.&nbsp; Certainly,
  he was under tremendous stress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>The present and previous conditions might have caused severe pressure
  on his health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
  </span>The German authorities have pointed out that Prof. Azad may have died
  of stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">Nonetheless,
  there is a legitimate concern for those who loves him to find out the real
  cause of his sudden demise while he was sleeping.&nbsp; The demand for a
  proper postmortem is a realistic one.&nbsp; However, do we need to wait for
  the postmortem to know the cause of his premature death?&nbsp; For an
  unnatural death, the postmortem is done to carry out subsequent investigation.&nbsp;
  In particular, if it is suspected that there were killers behind the death,
  then the postmortem lead toward finding and capturing the killers.&nbsp; In
  the case of Dr. Azad, there were attacks upon him because of Fatwas by the
  political Islamists.&nbsp; The criminals openly declared him <i>Murtaad</i>
  (apostate).&nbsp; By this declaration and Fatwas, the political Islamists
  encouraged their goons to attack him and continued to threaten him and his
  family.&nbsp; The killers threatened him even in the parliament.&nbsp;
  Therefore, without postmortem, we should know who the silent killers were.&nbsp;
  The defeated political force of 1971 that includes the Islamists is the
  killer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they are now in the cabinet, in the parliament,
  and in the administration.&nbsp; We do not need a detail account of Prof.
  Azad’s death to discern the fact that the gangs of the political Islamists,
  who are doing politics and sharing power under the umbrella of Jamaat-i-Islami,
  are the real killer of the renowned academic.&nbsp; The late professor was
  disheartened to know that the government as usual had miserably failed to
  track down the gang of murderers who attacked him on the fateful night of
  February 27, 2004.<o:p>
