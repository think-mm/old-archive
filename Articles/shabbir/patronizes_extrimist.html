	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As of this moment, Bangladesh is 
	going through some rough weather after the recent spate of bomb blasts in 
	all but one district. A good number of people are now expressing their 
	concerns after about more than five hundred bomb blasts throughout 
	Bangladesh. Many of them expressing their concerns were very much in denial 
	for a long time. For reasons unknown to me, they chose to disregard what the 
	fundamentalists were saying and what their present government in power was 
	doing to protect them. <br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The present growth of the 
	fundamentalists throughout the country is the result of the indifferent 
	attitude of the good number of educated Bengalis living both inside and 
	outside Bangladesh. In fact, the leading section of expatriate Bengalis even 
	tried to undermine the efforts of those who were in the forefront to express 
	their concerns on the ominous growth of the criminals under the 
	patronization of the present fundamentalist coalition government, consisting 
	of the well-known Islamic extremist parties such as Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and 
	Islami Unity Council (Islamic Oikko Jote or IOJ). The overall attitude of 
	the defenders of the present regime and the “Image Conscious” expatriate 
	Bengalis helped the cancerous growth of the Islamic extremists on the soil 
	of Bangladesh. Especially, the “Image Conscious” defenders of the coalition 
	government gave protection by denying the crimes of the Islamist and the 
	semi-Islamist cadres/workers of the fundamentalist parties. These groups of 
	people used to be critical to anyone writing or saying freely about the 
	existence of the Islamic extremists in Bangladesh. They used to be ultra 
	conscious for the image of Bangladesh. In fact, they were conscious about 
	the deteriorating image of the fundamentalist coalition government under 
	Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), JI, and IOJ. They penned serious 
	articles to protest against the writings of Mr. Alex Perry of Time Magazine, 
	Mr. Bertil Litner of Far Eastern Economic Review, and Ms. Eliza Griswold of 
	New York Times. But, now the Pandora’s box has been opened by the Islamic 
	terrorists through their terrorism in the whole of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is true that without getting any 
	real resistance from all sections of Bengalis, the present government became 
	very much bold in carrying out unethical and illegal acts. They not only 
	released on-trial Islamic terrorists but also let loose convicted criminals. 
	For example, just recently, the present law minister of the coalition 
	government Mr. Moudud Ahmed helped release a double murderer by the name 
	Mohiuddin Jintu through presidential pardon in collaboration with the Prime 
	Minister, Mrs. Khaleda Zia. The convict is a BNP leader. He met the Prime 
	Minister and the law minister abroad and got assurances for this pardon. In 
	essence, the PM gave this high profile criminal impunity. This is the sad 
	state of affair in present-day Bangladesh. Look how things work out in the 
	country. The convicted killer came to Bangladesh from abroad and went to 
	jail without any fear for his execution. He applied for mercy to the 
	president. The law minister hastily gave notes to the president to expedite 
	the approval of the mercy for the convicted killer. The double murderer 
	Mohiuddin Jintu was pardoned within a few days while two other convicts were 
	executed earlier for the same crime. The president even did not dare to pay 
	heed to the charge of double murder against the convict. Like a robot, he 
	pardoned the criminal. The president acted like a sixth-grader and did not 
	question the impropriety that surrounds the Jintu affair. The president’s 
	conscious did not work a bit and he acted just blindly to protect his party 
	cadre/leader. By pardoning a criminal, the law minister, the prime minister, 
	and the president actually encouraged the other criminals allied to the 
	government. In fact, the Islamic militants in Bangladesh got similar 
	messages in all the past years since the present fundamentalist government 
	came to power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The governments under BNP in the 
	past and now had released so many criminals that one will simply get tired 
	to count them. With a political motive, the military dictator Zia pardoned 
	convicted killers of the seven murders that took place in Dhaka University 
	in 1974. With the same motive, the dictator even gave indemnity to the 
	killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, of his family members, and all those who 
	died in 1975; for this to happen through constitutional amendments, Gen. Zia 
	had to rely on a bunch of constitutional lawyers in Bangladesh. There is no 
	dearth of sycophant barristers in Bangladesh. If my memory serves me right, 
	Barrister Ishtiaq who is highly touted in Bangladesh as an epitome of 
	scholar also did his part to appease the despotic ruler in 1975-1976. 
	Basically, the RayBan-clad military dictator, Zia, wanted to ensure the 
	protection for the killers. His wife Mrs. Khaleda Zia is also following in 
	her husband’s footsteps. Her government gave indemnity to those who killed 
	during operation clean heart with a view to keep her source of power happy 
	in Bangladesh. All these examples indicate that the government under the 
	forces of BNP and their allies is not at all interested about ensuring 
	justice if it does not bring political benefit for them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The terrorists who are ideologically 
	aligned with BNP-Jamaat-IOJ clique did the recent spate of bomb blasts. 
	Naturally, the government would not want to take any step to disturb their 
	precious vote bank. The founder of BNP, the military dictator, created this 
	vote bank Ziaur Rahman himself. With time, the strength of the 
	fundamentalists in creating terror has increased by manifolds. They have 
	been encouraged through various actions of the government now in power. 
	Already, the reports in newspapers (The Daily Janakantha, The Daily Jugantor, 
	The Daily Star, The Daily Prothom Alo, etc.) are out that reveal the 
	reluctance of the government higher up to take action against the real 
	perpetrators of the recent terrorist acts. It is reported that the 
	terrorists belonging to Jamaat-i-Islami and their student wing have been 
	released and exonerated from any interrogation. Even warnings have been 
	issued by the government higher up not to arrest any cadres belonging to the 
	government parties, especially JI and their student wing. The newspaper 
	reports (Bangladesh origin) now indicate that the BNP-Jamaat and Jamatul 
	Mujahidin cadres are working jointly in many places in Bangladesh. Many of 
	the terrorists are connected to the government higher up, for which the law 
	enforcement people cannot even ask them a question, let alone issuing a 
	warrant for an arrest. Therefore, the defenders of the present government 
	and the “Image Conscious” Bengalis should wake up from their long slumber. 
	We certainly do not want to project the image of Bangladesh as another 
	Afghanistan. We should protest against the patronization of the terrorists 
	by the government under BNP-JI-IOJ.</font><br>
