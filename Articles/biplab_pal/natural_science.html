  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For last one hundred years, we see 
	growing tendency of interpreting Quran, Upanishad etc. in terms of natural 
	science. Funny thing is, all of a sudden everybody seems to understand 
	Quantum Mechanics, Big-Bang theory etc. even if none has any background in 
	classical mechanics or in experimentation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What caused the problem? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Few senile physicists of course. Few 
	of them were found of concept of 'non-dualism' in eastern philosophy. Name 
	includes Tesla, Subramanyam Chandrashekhar, Edwin Tailor and many who's who 
	in modern physics. However, what we have to note strongly, none of them 
	tried to search natural science in the scripture. To them, non-dualism is a 
	'mythical philosphy' that seems to fit well with their spiritual needs. But 
	then, some 'B' grade physicists, who could not make any name in proper 
	science, tried to win cheap popularity and started writing books relating 
	'Maya' with quantum mechanics etc. One of such name is John Dobson, author 
	of &quot;Adaiya Vedanta and modern science&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a sample, his logic goes like 
	this: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) All this is Brahman. Let a 
		man meditate on that visible world as beginning, ending and breathing in 
		it, the Brahman. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2) Now mind is, as it were, a 
		sense of otherness in That. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3) In the changeless. In the 
		infinite. In the undivided. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4) Its appearance is through the 
		Gunas of which ignorance, Maya, is made. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5) Concealing, projecting, yet 
		revealing, in the projected, something of that which is concealed.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6) As something of the rope is 
		revealed in the snake for which it is mistaken. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7) As if, being hidden, through 
		the veiling power of Tamas, the nature of Brahman, through the revealing 
		power of Sattva, shone in the otherness for which, through the 
		projecting power of Rajas, it is, as it were, mistaken. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8) By this Vivarta, the 
		changeless, the infinite, the undivided as Asti-Bhati-Priya. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9) Giving rise to Parinama 
		(transformation) in the causal, the subtle and the gross. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And then he relates this vedantic 
	conjecture with modern science as </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We can understand the attraction 
	between the proton and the electron as the undividedness seen in the 
	duality, just as we can understand the gravitational attraction of the 
	protons for each other as the undividedness seen in the plurality. As a 
	member of the duality, the proton sees itself (if we may use such language) 
	as separated from the electron. As a member of the plurality, it sees itself 
	as separated from the rest of the universe. But in either case it sees 
	itself as small, and we can understand the self- repulsion of like charge as 
	simply the infinitude seen in the apparent smallness. The gravitational 
	energy of the primordial hydrogen can be understood as priya, the undivided 
	seen in the apparently divided. The electrical energy of the primordial 
	hydrogen can be understood as bhati, the infinite seen in the apparently 
	finite. Bhati and Priya drive the change in which the changeless is seen as 
	Asti, inertia. In the great-space, this is our primordial hydrogen. It 
	arises through apparition, through the appearance of pairs of opposites, 
	space against time, mass against energy, gravity against electricity, plus 
	against minus and spin-up against spin-down, without any change in the 
	changeless. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have seen how, through relativity 
	theory, modern science has been driven to the conclusion of the Advaita 
	Vedantins that the first cause must be apparitional. The screen through 
	which we see the reality must be the screen of apparitional causation  what 
	the Vedantins call Maya. We have also seen how, through relativity theory, 
	modern science has been driven to the conclusion that the nature of the 
	reality which underlies the multifarious diversity in the world of our 
	perceptions must be changeless, infinite and undivided. Finally, and this is 
	the important point, we have seen that, through a careful analysis of 
	apparitional causation we are able, at last, to understand why we see a 
	universe of hydrogen and not something else. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What we see here and we also see 
	same in the logic of Vir Gupta and people alike. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What this people do not realize is
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'What is the definition and scope of 
	a theory in physics&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Science by definition is repeatable 
	observable truth. Science is not a collection of theories or the assumptions 
	made for the formulation of the theories or neither 
	conclusions/interpretation from an equation unless any of it is 
	experimentally verified. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An example from the last debate can 
	be cited: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/21384">
	http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/21384</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Electron's spin is a theoretical 
	postulate that has been used to match experimental results in Zeeman's 
	splitting or in Fine structure splitting. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Truth here is the wave number 
	difference that we can measure in fine structure splitting. That is science. 
	Intrinsic angular momentum of electron is an assumption/model and in future 
	there can be a experimental result is deviating, we search for a better 
	theory or a better model. No model is an absolute truth, but just a tool to 
	understand the reality conformed by state-of-the art experiments. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, effort to relate old philosophy 
	with modern science is absolute garbage, since old scriptures never recorded 
	any experimental observation (that is the only science) that led to the 
	foundation of modern theories. Also, advanced mathematics needed to explain 
	these observation was absent. So, only a few lunatics or perfect idiots can 
	think of relating modern natural science with religious scripture. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hope none of our beloved Muktomona 
	readers is lunatic enough to spend his time on it! </font></p>
