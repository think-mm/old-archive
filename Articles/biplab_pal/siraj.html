	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First of all, I am shocked to be 
	termed as communal. Those who are familiar with my postings in this forum, 
	know pretty well that I am fighting against Sangha philosophy all the time.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now some clarifications from 
	history. The fact that all the postings identified Jagat Seth as a person, 
	proves that none of you has gone through history as thoroughly as you should 
	be before commenting on this topic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jagat seth is a family title enjoyed 
	by two brothers. I did read some research papers on this period and now I 
	would request you to remove some misconceptions that we inherited from our 
	school text books that portayed Siraj as great independant Nawab. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[1] There was seven Hindu Kings/Zamindar 
	under Nawab of Bengal: King of Nadia Krishna Chandra ( who was main 
	conspirator), King of Burdwan, Kingdom of Natore, Kingdom of Ban Bishnupur, 
	etc.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nawab never ruled Bengal directly. 
	These local kings were ruling more or less independantly paying taxes to 
	Nawab. Nawab's army was also highly dependant on the supplies from these 
	seven kingdoms. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the first war against British 
	(1748), King of Burwan supplied all the logistics to 40,000 army of Siraj.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[2] During the time of Nawab 
	Alibardi ( grand father of Siraj), relationship between Hindu Kings and 
	Nawab was very cordial. Attack by the Maratha invadors (Bargi) was common 
	ground to be united. While fighting against one of such invasion against 
	Bargi, Alibardi was running away after losing a battle in Bihar. He was 
	abondoned by all of his Generals. However, one small group leader 
	(Mansabdar) didn't leave him. This man was Mirjafar. Strange as it sounds, 
	upon return to Murshidabad, Alibardi elevated Mirjaffor to be one of his 
	main General, as a reward to his loyality and faithfulness. Mirjaffor was a 
	devoted Muslim. He was very loyal and honest to Alibardi. Later on, he was 
	married to Alibardi's family. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[3] Nature of Siraj's communalism 
	needs to be adjudged against [1] &amp; [2]. Several times Siraj expressed 
	dissatisfaction that he had to depend on Hindues for any kind of financing 
	and he predicted that these Kafirs would betray him one day ( he was right 
	indeed). Besides, his force abduction of any woman was a matter of great 
	concern among the Hindu Kings as he even didn't spare their families. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He abducted daughter-in-law (not 
	daughter) of older Jagat Seth brother ( Manik Chand probably). However, he 
	was vehemently opposed by Mirjaffor who was a man of moral character (!) and 
	finally he had to abondon the abduction. Maharani of Natore had a beutiful 
	widow daughter. When she was visiting her palace in Murshidabad, Siraj got a 
	glimpse of her daughter's beauty. He immediately sent his army to capture 
	her. However, the news was leaked and Maharani's widow daughter was 
	evacuated in the disguise of a dead woman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact that Alibardi was a man of 
	honor and Siraj was communal is revealed through several documents: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[A] Communication between Krishna 
	Chandra and Jagat Seth brothers. From their letters, you would learn that 
	Jagar Seth never wanted to help British against Siraj. Reason is simple: 
	Jagat Seth's main business was financing and banking. They knew once East 
	India company would get their grip, they will be knocked out from the 
	business. ( Their business was indeed ruined by East India company). They 
	knew that their business is always safe under Nawab. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However after the abduction of their 
	daughter-in-law, they had no choice but to agree to King of Nadia,Krishna 
	Chandra, who was indeed the first and core conspirator against Siraj. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">B. Communication between Lord Clive 
	and East India company senate: Clive mentioned in his communication that 
	Hindu kings are extremely hostile against Siraj and they would help in any 
	attempt to depose him. Clive mentioned that Hindu kings are greatly worried 
	about to protect their religion under Nawab's rule. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">C. Communication between Maharani of 
	Natore and Maharaja Krishna Chandra </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">D. Communication between King of 
	Burdwan and Krishna Chandra: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In C and D, you will find explicit 
	language used by Krishna Chandra to term Siraj as communal. His letter 
	indeed started as an appeal to protect Sanatan Hindu religion against Siraj.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One has to remember, Krishna Chandra 
	and Alibardi were great friend. Krishna Chandra was very loyal to Muslim 
	Nawab Alibardi. So we can not term him to be born communal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[5] Siraj had nearly 50,000 soldiers 
	against 3000 British soldiers! So he had nothing to be afraid of the 
	British! Hmm..But he was afraid. He was afraid of being betrayed. He knew 
	that Hindu kings were no more on his side. Lord Clive indeed rested in the 
	palace of Krishna Chandra on his way to Palassey. Krishna Chandra provided 
	local logistics to Clive. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Siraj insulted Mirjaffor times and 
	again in the Royal court. Madanlal and Mohanlal, these two Kashmiri hindu 
	generals were his favorite,as myth revealed. He knew Mirjaffor might betray. 
	But still he never trusted Mirmodan or Mohanlal to be in charge of Royal 
	army. They were in charge of a small troup of 1500. Was it a noncommunal 
	judgement? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[6] Finally, A. Durgapuja in present 
	form started in Kolkata from 18th century. Vabani Majumdar from royal family 
	of Nadia, was first to start Durga puja in Bengal in 16th century but it 
	started becoming popular among Zamindar families only in 18th century, 
	almost a century after Siraj's death. B. Jagatdhatri Puja started also with 
	king of Nadia, and Maharaj Krishna Chandra was the greatest patron. This 
	puja is still confined in Krishnanagar and Chandannagar. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I don't know where did you get the 
	information that Siraj patronized both the pujas. This seems to be 
	impossible given space and time contradiction problems. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">CONCLUSION: When we are seeking 
	truth, we can not afford to be either emotional or biased. </font></p>
