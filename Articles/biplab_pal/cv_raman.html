	Hate Chaliyach e Andharer Yatri</a>’. I was reading it and got inspired to 
	write this piece. For long time, I was reading a lot of articles and 
	collection of his papers and therefore, I thought I might bring some 
	interesting light into his invention. My effort might be useful for the 
	readers of our forum to appreciate Raman Effect and the way it is still 
	changing the world. ]</i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Professor Raman 
	brought his ticket to Europe in 1929 to attend the Nobel Prize awarding 
	ceremony in 1930, indeed a year earlier before he was declared for the 
	prize. Such was the confidence of this great man, that after seeing the 
	effect in Feb,1928 and declaring it in a conference on 16<sup>th</sup> 
	March, 1928,&nbsp; he had no doubt in his mind that he is going to be recipient 
	of Nobel prize in physics in 1930! Surprisingly physics world was in unison 
	with his claim (Appendix A: Politics of Nobel prize in 1930)! In the history 
	of Nobel Prize, nobody was awarded Nobel Prize so quickly after their major 
	contribution. On average it takes a decade to recognize the merit of any 
	discovery. But in Raman’s case it was an exception and sometimes I have been 
	puzzled by the fact, how come Raman was so confident about his wining in 
	1930 when revolutionary contributions in physics discovered much before 
	Raman effects have not been awarded till that time! That includes Heisenberg 
	(who discovered the famous uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and 
	also credited for Matrix operator approach in quantum mechanics. He was 
	awarded Nobel in 1932. Raman defeated Heisenberg by 6 to 1! See appendix), 
	Schrödinger (Famous Schrödinger equation that led first theoretical 
	foundation of quantum mechanics. He was awarded Nobel in 1933 with PM Dirac) 
	and PM Dirac (The man who founded relativistic quantum mechanics and led the 
	foundation of interaction of light with electrons)! &nbsp;Indeed, Raman defeated 
	Schrödinger, Dirac and Heisenberg in 1930 who were also nominated for Nobel 
	Prize in physics for the year of 1930 as you will find from the appendix.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For long time, 
	this was a puzzle to me. I knew Nobel committee was under obligation to 
	respect Nobel’s original will - merit of application to mankind should be 
	the first priority. However that didn’t make it clear to me why Raman Effect 
	was a ‘killer discovery’ for human civilization so that it was merited above 
	Schrödinger’s wave equation or Heisenberg’s uncertainty principles! It took 
	me quite a while to break this puzzle. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before we break 
	the puzzle, we will walk down the lane of 210 Bow Bazaar Street in Calcutta 
	where Prof CV Raman was carrying out his experiments on scattering of light 
	by liquid from 1918, after the foundation of Indian cultivation of science 
	in the same year. It was the glorious time for Calcutta University—in its 
	newly founded post graduate physics department, faculty includes Sir CV 
	Raman, SN Bose, MN Saha and SK Mitra. Later in their careers, all of them 
	would be elected as a fellow of Royal Society. For a brief period of two 
	decades, Calcutta was the most intense site for fundamental research in 
	science outside Europe. Even in Europe, except for centers of excellence 
	like University of Gottingen in Germany, University of Oxford and Cambridge, 
	London University and&nbsp; So bourn University in Paris, Calcutta University has 
	no parallel. When I was looking at what was going on in MIT, Harvard and 
	Princeton University between 1910-1930, I really felt proud that for a brief 
	period, research in cultivation of science in Calcutta, exceeded the 
	standard of these famous University chain in USA. Unfortunately we could not 
	keep the standard up because of socio-economical dynamics between science 
	and the society.&nbsp; Continuation of excellence in science needs Buddhist 
	model—Dharma (the belief in their own standard of science), Buddha (the 
	great teachers of science) and Sangha (The university system and its 
	students who will be the next generation of teachers). We never had a 
	shortage of students or teachers but our Sangha, University system has 
	continuously faltered. Not that Neheru didn’t take enough initiative to fund 
	money for science. Indeed he did.&nbsp; Council of Industrial and Scientific 
	Research (CSIR), Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), 
	Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indian Institute of Science (ISc), 
	Department of Atomic energy (DAE) and Indian Space Research Organization 
	(ISRO) are all ‘dreams come true story’ for Neheruvite socialism. But none 
	of the organization could repeat a Raman story! Reason is deeply lying in 
	Neheruvite socialism itself. Today MIT, Stanford, Princeton are center of 
	excellence in Science and technology because it receives huge grant to 
	develop new technology from Defense organizations (DARPA) and contractors 
	like Boeing, Lockheed Martin ( company that manufactures F16/18), General 
	dynamics etc. Where as in India, from its beginning, DRDO is crippling to 
	develop new science and technology thanks to the fact that greedy Generals 
	and defense ministers were more interested to pocket billions of dollars 
	worth of Russian commission for arms sale rather than proliferating 
	commercialization of Defense research like in UK and USA. During Second 
	World War all the greatest technologies were developed by commercial 
	companies who generally hold a much higher degree of accountability of 
	delivery. &nbsp;Quite naturally, DRDO/DAE has no accountability in delivery and 
	as a consequence, most of scientists in DRDO/DAE are more interested in 
	trading stocks than doing research (when I was a trainee in Saha Institute 
	of Nuclear Physics, I was appalled by some of its scientists who were more 
	involved in their personal business than science). Strength of fundamental 
	research in an institute can be gauged from the excellence of its mechanical 
	workshop—and not by its latest state of the art instruments. That’s why once 
	former director of IIT-Kharagpur shouted his frustration in convocation- 
	“IIT has every &nbsp;equipment to do state of art research but for last four 
	decades we have not produced any innovation that is worth mentioning&nbsp; to the 
	world like Prof Raman did proudly on 28<sup>th</sup> February in 1928!'' </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Indian scientists 
	neglected the most important teaching of Raman that his student K S Krishnan 
	wrote in his diary&nbsp; --“ Professor always tells me that it is not good for a 
	scientists to be out from the laboratory for a long time and doing 
	theoretical research only “. This has exactly happened to Indian science, it 
	has moved from laboratory to theoretical hypothesis. Reason is simple. In 
	general defense and medical fields are greatest consumer of latest 
	discoveries in Physics and Chemistry. Due to lack of defense and medical 
	development, there is no outlet for Indian discoveries and innovations. In 
	USA, story is opposite. Venture capitalists are wielding their dollars to 
	convert even the simplest innovation from MIT and Stanford to gold. Quite 
	naturally in USA, thinking of the scientists are always occupied by 
	commercial landscape and in India for a long time, scientists lacked 
	objectives other than publishing papers. This has led to gradual degradation 
	of the position of scientists in Indian society. We can not imagine that 
	Tagore is raising fund for research of Prof J C Bose in this century. 
	Indeed, in his own words to King of Tripura, Tagore took pride to be a 
	beggar for Prof JC Bose. Quite naturally, when I opted for Physics instead 
	of Engineering in 1991, my parent thought I have gone out of my mind. Due to 
	the reduced status of the scientists in the society in the sub-continent, 
	only the students who can not get through Engineering schools are studying 
	science! The trend has affected the quality of science in India.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Indigenous 
	set-up from workshop of Howrah!</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, it is 
	extremely important to understand what Raman and his group was doing by 
	building their own equipments from numerous unskilled workshops of Howarh. 
	Strong sunlight is passed through a big aperture of a telescope and then 
	focused on a hole to collimate the light—to make it a straight pencil beam. 
	Raman and his students were using colored crystal and grating to make the 
	beam mono-chromatic (means light with only one wavelength)—a very 
	rudimentary technique. Then this beam was allowed to pass through liquid. 
	Typically, if a spectrometer (an optical instrument that breaks the light 
	into all of its colors or wavelengths) is placed at 90 degree angle of the 
	beam and from beam and liquid cross section, a faint scattered light can 
	always be found which is typically 1/1000 times weaker than the original 
	beam if the liquid is very pure without any solid particles. However, this 
	faint beam has same wavelength as that of original beam that has fallen on 
	the liquid. So it is as if, light has been scattered by the molecules. In 
	classical theory of electromagnetism, the scattered and incident light 
	should have same spectrum. Or in more simple words, green light will scatter 
	green only; blue light will scatter blue only!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<b>Raman could 
	not understand Raman Effect in 1922</b>!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1922, one of 
	Raman’s PhD student Ramanathan observed a faint green glow in the scattered 
	light when the original beam was blue. This is exception to what his group 
	knew at that time. However, he was carrying out experiments on effect of 
	magnetic anisotropy of the liquid and was never expecting anything like this 
	kind of green faint light. He actually saw the Raman Effect but he thought 
	it is fluorescent (</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A phenomena where 
	light absorbs a color say blue and then emits a characteristic color say 
	green). However this light was highly polarized and can not be from 
	fluorescent. Raman and Krishnan saw this phenomenon as well, but due to the 
	lack of knowledge of quantum scattering, they turn their suspicion on 
	impurity of the incident blue beam. However this spurious green light 
	remained a mystery till Compton announced his epoch making experimental 
	results that X-ray scattered by electron has an interesting property which 
	can be explained only through the newly developed subject of quantum 
	mechanics. Compton proved that wavelength of the X-ray get modified by both 
	the bound and free state of the electron. Something that can be explained 
	only if light is considered as a particle like photon colliding with certain 
	energy with electron and electron is altering the energy of the photon as a 
	result of collision!</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Inspired by 
	Compton Effect:</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Raman immediately 
	got interested in Compton Effect and indeed set up an experimental 
	arrangement to observe Compton Effect as early as in 1923 using an entirely 
	different concept. In Dec 1927, Compton was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics. 
	In the same day, the news was published in evening chronicle of Calcutta. As 
	per K S Krishnan’s diary, Professor grabbed the paper and run into the 
	laboratory</font></p>

	Krishnan, if this is true of X-rays, it must be true of light too. There

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>&nbsp;</i></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">. KS Krishnan was 
	actually involved in the study of magnetism but Raman told him to dig the 
	faint green scattered light that they have failed to explain for a long 
	time. Raman was sure, since X-ray is nothing but an electromagnetic wave, 
	similar phenomena should also happen in liquid in visible domain since 
	electrons are loosely bound in liquid! And he wanted to see the end of the 
	enigma of feeble green scattering. On 16<sup>th</sup> March 1928, while 
	explaining this new effect for the first time, he announced “</font></p>

	provided when I conceived the idea that the effect was some kind of optical

	<span class="ps39">The ‘experimental re-examination’ started in January 
	1928. During the same month,</span> <span class="ps40">Venkateswaran was 
	studying the phenomenon of light scattering in highly viscous and magnetic 
	liquid.</span> <span class="ps1">&nbsp;While experimenting with glycerin, he made 
	the same observation again-</span> <span class="ps2">that the blue filtered 
	sunlight scattered in a highly purified sample of the</span>
	<span class="ps3">liquid was green instead of the usual blue. Tests with 
	different filters transmitting</span> <span class="ps4">narrow regions of 
	the solar spectrum showed that in every case the scattered light was</span>
	<span class="ps5">different in color from that of the incident beam.

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="ps6">
	As we saw before, Raman was sure that he is observing optical equivalent of 
	Compton Effect and prevailed upon Krishnan to undertake a thorough</span>
	<span class="ps7">investigation of the phenomenon, drawing him away from the 
	theoretical problems</span> <span class="ps8">he was busy with at the time. 
	Since sunlight was the principal incident source they</span>
	<span class="ps9">were using and since Venkateswaran, a part-time worker at 
	the laboratory could</span> <span class="ps10">only devote time early in the 
	morning or late in the afternoon, the responsibility of</span>
	<span class="ps11">carrying on with the experiments fell on Krishnan’s 
	shoulders.</span> <span class="ps12">The Raman Effect was discovered on 28 
	February 1928. It was a tireless pursuit</span> <span class="ps13">lasting 
	about four to five weeks and in the end was a great experimental discovery,</span>
	<span class="ps14">yet to be matched in contemporary Indian science. 
	Krishnan kept a record of the events</span> <span class="ps15">in the form 
	of a diary. The diary contains an elaborate day-to-day account of the quest</span>
	<span class="ps16">that ultimately led to this discovery. We reproduce below

	it first. Not only that,&nbsp; even after Raman explained to him what to except,

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ok. We learned in

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>How Raman 
	Effect changed the Organic chemistry</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Answer lies in 
	understanding vibrational spectroscopy of organic compounds that is 
	typically observed in infrared domain (IR). Study of infrared spectroscopy 
	in 1930s was nearly impossible since Infrared spectrometry is extremely 
	difficult and till today, it is under-developed subject. However, Raman 
	scattering opens a new area in spectroscopy where information embedded in IR 
	spectroscopy can also be obtained from Raman spectroscopy but from its 
	UV-VIS (ultraviolet-visible) study which is a developed subject. But why IR 
	spectroscopy is so hot?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Simple to 
	understand. All the chemical bonding in organic and inorganic substances is 
	essentially a kind of small vibrational string that holds together two 
	atoms. This bonding can only be understood from its vibrational spectrum 
	that is typically in IR domain.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence discovery of 
	Raman Effect gave unprecedented powerful tool to understand structure of 
	bonding in the molecules which was otherwise impossible to carry out using 
	IR spectroscopy directly! It won’t be prudent to say, early development of 
	organic chemistry before the discovery of NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), 
	owes its progress to Raman spectroscopy. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In recent decades, 
	Raman scattering become important phenomena with the discovery of Raman 
	scattering in optical fiber- that gave birth to two very important discovery 
	of last decade. Fiber Raman laser and Fiber Raman amplifier. Both the 
	devices outperformed its traditional competitors for various reasons. Right 
	now all the long distance trans-oceanic fiber optic cable are using Raman 
	amplifier to amplify its signal because it has much better signal to noise 
	ration over its traditional rival Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA). 
	Eventually Raman amplifier will replace all the optical amplifiers over next 
	two decades in Fiber optic networks – or backbone of our communication 
	system. Unlike photoelectric or Compton Effect, Raman scattering remains an 
	ever green subject to build new device using non-liner optics of Raman 
	scattering. Its remains the most potent effect to be utilized in building 
	future all optical computing or Quantum informatics. In terms of diversity 
	of applications and potential for future use, Raman Effect is only compared 
	to discovery of laser and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the last 
	century. A summery of application is listed in Appendix B:</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today Raman 
	spectroscopy has become much more sophisticated and much simpler to 
	measure.&nbsp; Major technological advances have transformed Raman spectroscopy 
	from telescopes and visual observation to a highly sensitive spectroscopic 
	technique.&nbsp; The first technological advance was the laser.&nbsp; The sun is 
	pretty bright, but it is sending its energy in all directions and over a 
	very broad range of wavelengths.&nbsp; The Raman Effect is observed as a shift in 
	energy of a photon and the shift can be related to a vibrational state of 
	the sample.&nbsp; To observe the shift one needs all of the photons to be a very 
	narrow band of energies.&nbsp; Otherwise, you’ll never be able to distinguish the 
	shifted ones from the source photons. &nbsp;The laser produces 
	quasi-monochromatic light that forms a very narrow band of frequencies.&nbsp; 
	Lasers also produce this light in a small concentrated beam that is very 
	intense.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A second technological advance that 
	has revolutionized Raman spectroscopy is the Charge Coupled Device (CCD).&nbsp; 
	The CCD is millions of times more sensitive than the eye and is able to 
	record a complete Raman spectrum in less than a second.&nbsp; Let’s look back at 
	the history of Raman spectroscopy to understand the advantage that the CCD 
	affords.&nbsp; Not long after Raman’s first experiments scientists started using 
	a photographic plate to record the Raman spectrum.&nbsp; This provided the first 
	hardcopy of a Raman spectrum.&nbsp; The problem was that it didn’t have a 
	softcopy version that could be used for data analysis and spectral 
	manipulation.&nbsp; Early Raman spectroscopy was also like shooting in the dark.&nbsp; 
	The plates were exposed for hours to get a spectrum and you didn’t know if 
	the optics were properly aligned until the plate was developed.&nbsp; The next 
	big advance was the photomultiplier tube.&nbsp; This is a sensitive optical 
	transducer that converts photons into electrons.&nbsp; They are sensitive enough 
	to detect a single photon and a whole technology of “single photon counting” 
	grew around them.&nbsp; Now a Raman spectroscopist could set his instrument to 
	view an energy where Raman scattering should be observed and with an 
	electronic display optimize the optical alignment.&nbsp; When computers became 
	commonly available it was possible to have them record this electronic 
	signal and produce a software file that contained the spectrum.&nbsp; This 
	software file could be manipulated to remove artifacts that otherwise can 
	distort Raman spectra.&nbsp;</font></p>

	a town on the banks of the river Cauvery. Chandrasekhara Ayyar was a teacher 
	in a school there. He was a scholar in Physics and Mathematics. He loved 
	music. His wife was Parvathi Ammal. Their second son was born on 7th 
	November 1888. They named the boy Venkata Raman. He was also called 
	Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman or <br>
	C.V. Raman.<br>
	<br>
	Raman grew up in an atmosphere of music, Sanskrit literature and Science. He 
	stood first in every class and was talked about as a child genius. He joined 
	the B.A. class of the Presidency College. In the year 1905, he was the only 
	boy who passed in the first class. He won a gold medal, too.<br>
	<br>
	He joined the M.A. class in the same college and chose Physics (study of 
	matter and energy) as the main subject of study. Love of science, enthusiasm 
	for work and the curiosity to learn new things were natural to Raman. Nature 
	had also given him the power of concentration and intelligence. He used to 
	read more than what was taught in the class. When doubts arose he would set 
	down questions like 'How?' 'Why?' and 'Is this true?' in the Margin in the 
	textbooks.<br>
	<br>
	The works of the German scientist Helmhotlz (1821 - 1891) and the English 
	scientist Lord Raleigh (1842 - 1919) on acoustics (the study of sound) 
	influenced Raman. He took immense interest in the study of sound. When he 
	was eighteen years of age, one of his research papers was -published in the 
	'Philosophical Magazine' of England. Later another paper was published in 
	the scientific journal 'Nature'.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Raman's elder 
	brother C.S. Ayyar was in the 'Indian Audit and Accounts Service' <br>
	(I.A.A.S.). Raman also wanted to enter the same department. So he sat for 
	the <br>
	competitive examination. The day before this examination, the results of the 
	M.A. <br>
	examination were published. He had passed in first class recording the 
	highest marks in Madras University up to that time. He stood first in the 
	I.A.A.S. examination also.<br>
	<br>
	On May 6, 1907, Raman married Lokasundari Ammal. This was not a simple 
	marriage. His parents fixed a different bride for him. But Raman was 
	enamored by classical vocal of Lokasundari. So he made his choice and almost 
	did a small revolution in his conservative Ayyar society.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the age of nineteen, Raman held a 
	high post in the government. He was appointed as the Assistant Accountant 
	General in the Finance Department in Calcutta. And the same year something 
	happened to give a new turn to his life.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One evening Raman 
	was returning from his office in a tramcar. He saw the name plate of the 
	'Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science' at 210, Bow Bazaar 
	Street. Immediately he got off the tram and went in. Dr. Amritlal Sircar was 
	the Honorary Secretary of the Association. There were spacious rooms and old 
	scientific instruments, which could be used for demonstration of 
	experiments.<br>
	<br>
	Raman asked whether he could conduct research there in his spare time. 
	Sircar gladly agreed. Raman took up a house adjoining the Association. A 
	door was provided between his house and the laboratory. During the daytime 
	he would attend his office and carry out his duties. His mornings and nights 
	were devoted to research. This gave him full satisfaction. So he continued 
	his ceaseless activities in Calcutta.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At that time Burma 
	and India were under a single government. In 1909, Raman was 
	transferred to. Rangoon, the capital of Burma. When Chandrasekhara Ayyar 
	passed away in 1910, Raman came to Madras on six months' leave.<br>
	<br>
	After completing the last rites, Raman spent the rest of his leave period 
	doing research in the Madras University laboratories.<br>
	<br>
	The Science College of Calcutta University was started in 1915.<br>
	<br>
	There a chair for Physics was established in memory of Taraknath Palit, a 
	generous <br>
	man. Raman was appointed Professor. He sacrificed the powerful post in the 
	government, which brought a good salary.<br>
	<br>
	The Indian Science Congress was started in 1913. Its aim was to bring 
	together scientists engaged in research; they should meet and exchange 
	ideas. Its first session <br>
	was held in 1914. Asuthosh Mukherjee was the President. Raman was the 
	President of the Physics section. Later he worked for many years as the 
	Secretary of the Science Congress. He presided over its annual sessions in 
	1929 and 1948.</font></p>

	when Raman was completely immersed in experiments and research. According to 
	the terms of the Palit Chair, he could have remained free from teaching 
	work, doing research only. But Raman had great pleasure in teaching. 
	Students were inspired by his lectures. They were eager to listen to him. He 
	would not stick to one particular textbook. His lectures brought the 
	fragrance of fresh research. They reflected Raman's great curiosity about 
	the secrets of nature. Usually the lecture was of an hour's duration. 
	Forgetting the time in the discussion of the subject, Professor Raman would 
	sometimes lecture for two or three hours. Any doubt or question from a 
	student would stimulate new scientific ideas.</font></p>

	<br>
	In the mornings too, most of his time was spent in the laboratory. He worked 
	in informal clothes. At 9.30 a.m. he would rush home. After a shave and a 
	bath he would dress up and send for a taxi. He would finish his breakfast in

	England as the represen- tative of Calcutta University. This was his first 
	visit abroad.<br>
	<br>
	Raman lectured in the ‘Physical Society’ of London. People came in large 
	numbers to <br>
	listen to him. He was introduced to J.J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford, the 
	famous English Physicists. Raman visited St. Paul’s Church in London. A 
	whisper at one point of the church tower is heard clearly at another point.

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Raman’s journey to 
	England and back was by sea. In his leisure hours, he used to sit on the 
	upper deck of the ship and enjoy the beauty of the vast sea. The deep blue 
	color of the Mediterranean Sea interested the scientist in him. Was the blue 
	due to the reflection of the blue sky? If so, how could it appear in the 
	absence of light? Even when big waves rolled over the surface, the blue 
	remained. As he thought over the problem, it flashed to him that the blue 
	color might be caused by the scatter- ing of the sun’s light by water 
	molecules. He turned over this idea in his mind again and gains. Immediately 
	after his return to Calcutta, he plunged into experiments. Within a month, 
	he prepared a research paper and sent it to the Royal Society of London. 
	Next year he published a lengthy article on the molecular scattering of 
	light.<br>
	<br>
	Raman never held the wrong belief that research could be carried out only 
	with <br>
	foreign-made or very complicated equipment. No doubt, he imported some 
	equipment. No doubt, he imported some equipment. But he prepared much of the 
	equipment he used with the help of his students</font><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana">.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Scientists of many 
	countries appreciated the research papers of Raman and his <br>
	colleagues. The Royal Society, the oldest and the most important science 
	society of 
	England, honored Raman in 1924 by electing his as its ‘Fellow’ (that is, a 
	member).<br>
	<br>
	The annual session of ‘The British Association for the Cultivation of 
	Science’ was held in the same year in Toronto (Canada). Raman inaugurated 
	the seminar on the scattering of light. R.A. Millikan, the famous American 
	Physicist, who also attended, was full of admiration for Raman. They became 
	fast friends too.<br>
	<br>
	At the Mount Wilson Observatory in California (U.S.A), a telescope of 
	100-inch width was in use. Those were the times when discoveries in the 
	field of astronomy (study of stars and planets and their movements) filled 
	people with wonder. Raman was always eager to learn new things. He spent a 
	couple of days on Mount Wilson. During the nights he viewed the Nebula 
	(bright or dark patch in the sky caused by distant stars or a cloud of gas 
	or dust.) Through the telescope and was thrilled.<br>
	<br>
	He went to Russia in 1925 to participate in the two hundredth anniversary of 
	the ‘Russian Academy of Sciences’.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many scholars were 
	working in the Calcutta laboratories to unlock the secrets of sound 
	and light. To all of them Professor Raman was the 'Guru' and the leader. He 
	had 
	observed the blue color of the deep glaciers (mass of ice or snow) in the 
	Alps mountain ranges. Taking the clue from this, some of the research 
	workers studied some scattering of light in ice and quartz crystals. They 
	also studied the scattering of light in liquids such as pure water and 
	alcohol, as well as in vapors and gases.<br>
	<br>
	With a complete mental picture of the phenomenon, Raman would proceed to 
	experiment systematically. After that he would write the research paper 
	based on the results of the experiments and arrange for its early 
	publication. Sometimes it would be late in the day by the time the final 
	copy was prepared. Then he would rush to the General Post Office in a taxi 
	to catch the last mail. Then he would enjoy a feast of Rasagulla with his 
	students.<br>
	<br>
	He started 'The Indian Journal of Physics' in 1926 to make the prompt 
	publication of 
	research papers possible.<br>
	<br>
	Raman wanted the young men working with him to take up independent positions 
	and to serve the nation. He felt that his laboratory was a centre of 
	training for young talent, but not a permanent storehouse.<br>
	<br>
	Raman's research on sound became famous allover the world. 'Handbuck der 
	Physic', a German Encyclopaedia of Physics, was published in 1927. Raman was 
	the only foreign scientist invited to contribute an article to it.</font></p>

	knighted him; thereafter Professor Raman came to be known as Professor Sir 
	C..V. Raman. The Royal Society of London awarded the Hughes Medal in

	Physics. No Indian and no Asian had received the Nobel Prize for Physics up 
	to that time. At the ceremony for the award, Raman used alcohol to

	being studied there. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On one of his visits there, Raman found the research workers puzzled at not

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Raman stepped 
	into the field of research, Modern Physics was in its infancy. It developed 
	numerous branches by the time he began working in his own Institute. Then 
	research workers had access to modern equipment and methods, which were not 
	available six decades earlier. They tended to study a small field and to 
	specialize in it. But Raman never limited his activities and interests to a 
	narrow field.<br>
	<br>
	Raman once inaugurated the 'General Practitioners' Conference' in Bangalore. 
	A <br>
	general practitioner is a doctor who treats common illnesses. Raman 
	humorously <br>
	commented on that occasion that he was a general practitioner in science. He 
	liked all 
	scientific problems whether they were small or big. His interest and 
	satisfaction lay in finding a solution to the problem.<br>
	<br>
	In 1969, the daughter of Nagendranath (who had been a research student under 
	him thirty years earlier and a leading geologist by now) was married; Raman 
	and his wife attended the reception. Raman drew Nagendranath aside and 
	explained his new problem; he was trying to find a theory of earthquakes 
	taking into account the actual shape of the earth and the wave-like nature 
	of the quakes. Raman was not a person to be satisfied with his past 
	achievements. He was always seeking new and vaster fields of study.<br>
	<br>
	Raman was a delightful speaker. Sprinkled with good humor, his talk was 
	usually <br>
	focussed on realities. Raman used to say that the color of the sea 
	interested him more than the fish, which lived in it. He thought that we 
	should have our own ships for oceanographic research (the study of the sea). 
	He often said that India lost her freedom because she took no interest in 
	the seas.</font></p>

	to waste his time. Time was most precious diamond to him. Whenever he was 
	approached by such questions on religion, he switched over the topic—you

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;No doubt <b>he was a

	A few days before his 83 birthday Raman suffered a mild heart attack. But

	<br>
	Without much encouragement, Raman had entered the field of science in his

	ahead in the world of science. By his achievements and self-respect he 
	earned an honored place for India in the world of science. He laid the 
	foundations of a scientific tradition in India by building up institutes for 
	research, by publishing science journals and by encouraging young 
	scientists. Truly he was the 'Grand Old Man of Indian Science'.<br>

	Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br>
	<br>
	The Academy of Sciences, has resolved to award the Nobel Prize in Physics 
	for 1930 to Sir Venkata Raman for his work on the scattering of light and 
	for the discovery of the effect named after him.<br>
	<br>
	The diffusion of light is an optical phenomenon, which has been known for a 
	long time. A ray of light is not perceptible unless it strikes the eye 
	directly. If, however, a bundle of rays of light traverses a medium in which 
	extremely fine dust is present, the ray of light will scatter to the sides 
	and the path of the ray through the medium will be discernible from the 
	side. We can represent the course of events in this way; the small particles 
	of dust begin to oscillate owing to electric influence from the ray of 
	light, and they form centres from which light is disseminated in all 
	directions. The wavelength, or the number of oscillations per second, in the 
	light thus diffused is here the same as in the original ray of light. But 
	this effect has different degrees of strength for light with different 
	wavelengths. It is stronger for the short wavelengths than for the long 
	ones, and consequently it is stronger for the blue part of the spectrum than 
	for the red part. Hence if a ray of light containing all the colours of the 
	spectrum passes through a medium, the yellow and the red rays will pass 
	through the medium without appreciable scattering, whereas the blue rays 
	will be scattered to the sides. This effect has received the name of the 
	&quot;Tyndall effect&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	<span style="color: black">
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1904/index.html">
	<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none">Lord Rayleigh</span></a></span>, 
	who has made a study of this effect, has put forward the hypothesis that the 
	blue colours of the sky and the reddish colouring that is observed at 
	sunrise and sunset is caused by the diffusion of light owing to the fine 
	dust or the particles of water in the atmosphere. The blue light from the 
	sky would thus be light-scattered to the sides, while the reddish light 
	would be light that passes through the lower layers of the atmosphere and 
	which has become impoverished in blue rays owing to scattering. Later, in 
	1899, Rayleigh threw out the suggestion that the phenomenon in question 
	might be due to the fact that the molecules of air themselves exercised a 
	scattering effect on the rays of light.<br>
	<br>
	In 1914 Cabannes succeeded in showing experimentally that pure and dustless 
	gases also have the capacity of scattering rays of light.<br>
	<br>
	But a closer examination of scattering in different substances in solid, 
	liquid, or gaseous form showed that the scattered light did not in certain 
	respects exactly follow the laws which, according to calculation, should 
	hold good for the Tyndall effect. The hypothesis which formed the basis of 
	this effect would seem to involve, amongst other things, that the rays 
	scattered to the sides were polarized. This, however, did not prove to be 
	exactly the case.<br>
	<br>
	This divergence from what was to be expected was made the starting point of 
	a searching study of the nature of scattered light, in which study Raman was 
	one of those who took an active part. Raman sought to find the explanation 
	of the anomalies in asymmetry observed in the molecules. During these 
	studies of his in the phenomenon of scattering, Raman made, in 1928, the 
	unexpected and highly surprising discovery that the scattered light showed 
	not only the radiation that derived from the primary light but also a 
	radiation that contained other wavelengths, which were foreign to the 
	primary light.<br>
	<br>
	In order to study more closely the properties of the new rays, the primary 
	light that was emitted from a powerful mercury lamp was filtered in such a 
	way as to yield a primary light of one single wavelength. The light 
	scattered from that ray in a medium was watched in a spectrograph, in which 
	every wavelength or frequency produces a line. Here he found that, in 
	addition to the mercury line chosen, there was obtained a spectrum of new 
	sharp lines, which appeared in the spectrograph on either side of the 
	original line. When another mercury line was employed, the same extra 
	spectrum showed itself round it. Thus, when the primary light was moved, the 
	new spectrum followed, in such a way that the frequency distance between the 
	primary line and the new lines always remained the same.<br>
	<br>
	Raman investigated the universal character of the phenomenon by using a 
	large number of substances as a scattering medium, and everywhere found the 
	same effect.<br>
	<br>
	The explanation of this phenomenon, which has received the name of the 
	&quot;Raman effect&quot; after its discoverer, has been found by Raman himself, with 
	the help of the modern conception of the nature of light. According to that 
	conception, light cannot be emitted from or absorbed by material otherwise 
	than in the form of definite amounts of energy or what are known as &quot;light 
	quanta&quot;. Thus the energy of light would possess a kind of atomic character. 
	A quantum of light is proportionate to the frequency of rays of light, so 
	that in the case of a frequency twice as great, the quanta of the rays of 
	light will also be twice as great.<br>
	<br>
	In order to illustrate the conditions when an atom emits or absorbs light 
	energy, we can, according to <span style="color: black">
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1922/index.html">
	<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none">Bohr</span></a></span>, 
	picture to ourselves the atom as consisting of a nucleus, charged with 
	positive electricity round which negative electrons rotate in circular paths 
	at various distances from the centre. The path of every such electron 
	possesses a certain energy, which is different for different distances from 
	the central body.<br>
	<br>
	Only certain paths are stable. When the electron moves in such a path, no 
	energy is emitted. When, on the other hand, an electron falls from a path 
	with higher energy to one with lower energy - that is to say, from an outer 
	path to an inner path - light is emitted with a frequency that is 
	characteristic of these two paths, and the energy of radiation consists of a 
	quantum of light. Thus the atom can give rise to as many frequencies as the 
	number of different transitions between the stable paths. There is a line in 
	the spectrum corresponding to each frequency.<br>
	<br>
	An incoming radiation cannot be absorbed by the atom unless its light 
	quantum is identical with one of the light quanta that the atom can emit.<br>
	<br>
	Now the Raman effect seems to conflict with this law. The positions of the 
	Raman-lines in the spectrum do not correspond, in point of fact, with the 
	frequencies of the atom itself, and they move with the activating ray. Raman 
	has explained this apparent contradiction and the coming into existence of 
	the lines by the effect of combination between the quantum of light coming 
	from without and the quanta of light that are released or bound in the atom. 
	If the atom, at the same time as it receives from without a quantum of 
	light, emits a quantum of light of a different magnitude, and if the 
	difference between these two quanta is identical with the quantum of light 
	which is bound or released when an electron passes from one path to another, 
	the quantum of light coming from without is absorbed. In that case the atom 
	will emit an extra frequency, which either will be the sum of or the 
	difference between the activating ray and a frequency in the atom itself. In 
	this case these new lines group themselves round the incoming primary 
	frequency on either side of it, and the distance between the activating 
	frequency and the nearest Raman-lines will be identical with the lowest 
	oscillation frequencies of the atom or with its ultrared spectrum. What has 
	been said as to the atom and its oscillations also holds good of the 
	molecule.<br>
	<br>
	In this way we get the ultrared spectrum moved up to the spectral line of 
	the activating light. The discovery of the Raman-line has proved to be of 
	extraordinarily great importance for our knowledge of the structure of 
	molecules.<br>
	<br>
	So far, indeed, there have been all but insuperable difficulties in the way 
	of studying these ultrared oscillations, because that part of the spectrum 
	lies so far away from the region where the photographic plate is sensitive. 
	Raman's discovery has now overcome these difficulties, and the way has been 
	opened for the investigation of the oscillations of the nucleus of the 
	molecules. We choose the primary ray within that range of frequency where 
	the photographic plate is sensitive. The ultrared spectrum, in the form of 
	the Raman-lines, is moved up to that region and, in consequence of that, 
	exact measurements of its lines can be effected.<br>
	<br>
	In the same way the ultraviolet spectrum can be investigated with the help 
	of the Raman effect. Thus we have obtained a simple and exact method for the 
	investigation of the entire sphere of oscillation of the molecules.<br>
	<br>
	Raman himself and his fellow-workers have, during the years that have 
	elapsed since the discovery was made, investigated the frequencies in a 
	large number of substances in a solid, liquid, and gaseous state. 
	Investigations have been made as to whether different conditions of 
	aggregation affect atoms and molecules, and the molecular conditions in 
	electrolytic dissociation and the ultrared absorption spectrum of crystals 
	have been studied.<br>
	<br>
	Thus the Raman effect has already yielded important results concerning the 
	chemical constitution of substances; and it is to foresee that the extremely 
	valuable tool that the Raman effect has placed in our hands will in the 
	immediate future bring with it a deepening of our knowledge of the structure 
	of matter.</font></p>
