		<div class="normaltext">
			<font face="Verdana">The research for my Ph.D. and the requirements 
			for a degree were essentially completed by 1973, when another war 
			erupted in the <ST1>Middle East</ST1>. I had strong feelings about 
			returning to 
<ST1>Egypt</ST1> to be a University Professor, even though at the beginning of
			<u>my years in <ST1>America</ST1> my memories of the frustrating 
			bureaucracy encountered at the time of my departure were still 
			vivid.</u> With time, things change, and I recollected all the 
			wonderful years of my childhood and the opportunities <ST1>Egypt</ST1> 
			had provided to me. Returning was important to me, but <u>I also 
			knew that <ST1>Egypt</ST1> would not be able to provide the 
			scientific atmosphere I had enjoyed in the <ST1>U.S.</ST1></u> A few 
			more years in <ST1>America</ST1> would give me and my family two 
			opportunities: First, I could think about another area of research 
			in a different place (while learning to be professorial!). Second, 
			my salary would be higher than that of a graduate student, and we 
			could then buy a big American car that would be so impressive for 
			the new Professor at <ST1>Alexandria University</ST1>! I applied for 
			five positions, three in the <ST1>U.S.</ST1>, one in 
<ST1>Germany</ST1> and one in <ST1>Holland</ST1>, and all of them with 
			world-renowned professors. I received five offers and decided on <ST1>
			Berkeley</ST1>.</font></div>
		<div class="normaltext">
			<font face="Verdana">Early in 1974 we went to <ST1>Berkeley</ST1>, 
			excited by the new opportunities. Culturally, moving from <ST1>
			Philadelphia</ST1> to <ST1>Berkeley</ST1> was almost as much of a 
			shock as the transition from <ST1>Alexandria</ST1> to <ST1>
			Philadelphia</ST1> 
			- <ST1>Berkeley</ST1> was a new world! I saw <ST1>Telegraph Avenue</ST1> 
			for the first time, and this was sufficient to indicate the 
			difference. I also met many graduate students whose language and 
			behavior I had never seen before, neither in <ST1>Alexandria</ST1>, 
			nor in <ST1>Philadelphia</ST1>. I interacted well with essentially 
			everybody, and in some cases I guided some graduate students. But I 
			also learned from members of the group. The obstacles did not seem 
			as high as they had when I came to the <ST1>University of 
			Pennsylvania</ST1> because culturally and scientifically I was 
			better equipped. <ST1>Berkeley</ST1> was a great place for science - 
			the BIG science. In the laboratory, my aim was to utilize the 
			expertise I had gained from my Ph.D. work on the spectroscopy of 
			pairs of molecules, called dimers, and to measure their coherence 
			with the new tools available at <ST1>Berkeley</ST1>. Professor 
			Charles Harris was traveling to 
<ST1>Holland</ST1> for an extensive stay, but when he returned to <ST1>Berkeley</ST1> 
			we enjoyed discussing science at late hours! His ideas were broad 
			and numerous, and in some cases went beyond the scientific language 
			I was familiar with. Nevertheless, my general direction was 
			established. I immediately saw the importance of the concept of 
			coherence. I decided to tackle the problem, and, in a rather short 
			time, acquired a rigorous theoretical foundation which was new to 
			me. I believe that this transition proved vital in subsequent years 
			of my research.</font></div>
		<div class="normaltext">
			<font face="Verdana">I wrote two papers with Charles, one 
			theoretical and the other experimental. They were published in <i>
			Physical Review</i>. These papers were followed by other work, and I 
			extended the concept of coherence to multidimensional systems, 
			publishing my first independently authored paper while at <ST1>
			Berkeley</ST1>. In collaboration with other graduate students, I 
			also published papers on energy transfer in solids. I enjoyed my 
			interactions with the students and professors, and at <ST1>Berkeley</ST1>'s 
			popular and well-attended physical chemistry seminars. Charles 
			decided to offer me the IBM Fellowship that was only given to a few 
			in the department. He strongly felt that I should get a job at one 
			of the top universities in <ST1>America</ST1>, or at least have the 
			experience of going to the interviews; I am grateful for his belief 
			in me. I only applied to a few places and thought I had no chance at 
			these top universities. During the process, I contacted <ST1>Egypt</ST1>, 
			and I also considered the <ST1>American University</ST1> in Beirut (AUB). 
			Although I visited some places, nothing was finalized, and I was 
			preparing myself for the return. Meanwhile, I was busy and excited 
			about the new research I was doing. Charles decided to build a 
			picosecond laser, and two of us in the group were involved in this 
			hard and &quot;non-profitable&quot; direction of research (!); I learned a 
			great deal about the principles of lasers and their physics.</font></div>
		<div class="normaltext">
			<font face="Verdana">During this period, many of the top 
			universities announced new positions, and Charles asked me to apply. 
			I decided to send applications to nearly a dozen places and, at the 
			end, after interviews and enjoyable visits, I was offered an 
			Assistant Professorship at many, including Harvard, Caltech, <ST1>
			Chicago</ST1>, Rice, and Northwestern. My interview at Caltech had 
			gone well, despite the experience of an exhausting two days, 
			visiting each half hour with a different faculty member in chemistry 
			and chemical engineering. The visit was exciting, surprising and 
			memorable. The talks went well and I even received some undeserved 
			praise for style. At one point, I was speaking about what is known 
			as the FVH, picture of coherence, where F stands for </font>
			<a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1965/index.html">
			<font face="Verdana">Feynman</font></a><font face="Verdana">, the 
			famous Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate. I went to the board to 
			write the name and all of a sudden I was stuck on the spelling. Half 
			way through, I turned to the audience and said, &quot;you know how to 
			spell Feynman&quot;. A big laugh erupted, and the audience thought I was 
			joking - I wasn't! After receiving several offers, the time had come 
			to make up my mind, but I had not yet heard from Caltech. I called 
			the Head of the Search Committee, now a colleague of mine, and he 
			was lukewarm, encouraging me to accept other offers. However, 
			shortly after this, I was contacted by Caltech with a very 
			attractive offer, asking me to visit with my family. We received the 
			red carpet treatment, and that visit did cost Caltech! I never 
			regretted the decision of accepting the Caltech offer.</font></div>
		<div class="normaltext">
			<font face="Verdana">My science family came from all over the world, 
			and members were of varied backgrounds, cultures, and abilities. The 
			diversity in this &quot;small world&quot; I worked in daily provided the most 
			stimulating environment, with many challenges and much optimism. 
			Over the years, my research group has had close to 150 graduate 
			students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting associates. Many of 
			them are now in leading academic, industrial and governmental 
			positions. Working with such minds in a village of science has been 
			the most rewarding experience - Caltech was the right place for me.</font></div>

			<font face="Verdana">My biological children were all &quot;made in <ST1>

			University</ST1> of <ST1>Texas</ST1>, <ST1>Austin</ST1>, and Amani, 
			a junior at <ST1>Berkeley</ST1>, both of whom I am very proud. I met 
			Dema, my wife, by a surprising chance, a fairy tale. In 1988 it was 
			announced that I was a winner of the King Faisal International 
			Prize. In March of 1989, I went to receive the award from <ST1>Saudi 
			Arabia</ST1>, and there I met Dema; her father was receiving the 
			same prize in literature. We met in March, got engaged in July and 
			married in September, all of the same year, 1989. Dema has her M.D. 
			from <ST1>Damascus University</ST1>, and completed a Master's degree

			<font face="Verdana">The journey from <ST1>Egypt</ST1> to <ST1>
			America</ST1> has been full of surprises. As a Moeid, I was unaware

			used to gather around the TV or read in the newspaper about the 
			recognition of famous Egyptian scientists and writers by the 
			President, and these moments gave me and my friends a real thrill - 
			maybe one day we would be in this position ourselves for 
			achievements in science or literature. Some decades later, when 
			President Mubarak bestowed on me the Order of Merit, first class, 
			and the Grand Collar of the <ST1>Nile</ST1> (&quot;Kiladate El Niel&quot;), 
			the highest State honor, it brought these emotional boyhood days 
			back to my memory. I never expected that my portrait, next to the
