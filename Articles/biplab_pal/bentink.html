	traditionally been regarded as demarcating the beginning of a new era in the 
	history of British India. Up to this time attitudes concerning the 
	governance of an alien society varied and were mostly discordant. But the 
	dominant ethos was ' reformist' and it grew in strength and stridency. 
	Initially held at bay, it captured the mind of Parliament first, 
	indoctrinated the bureaucratic class that was trained at Hailey bury to run 
	the new empire, and overwhelmed the objections of orientalists and 
	pragmatists .By 1828 liberals like Macauley and Utilitarian like Mill,

	appointed governor general of Bengal in 1827 and was successful in turning 
	the annual deficit of about £1.5 million into a surplus of about the same 
	amount. Consequently, the Charter Act of 1833 renewed the government of East 
	India Company, and Bentinck became the governor general of India in 1833. 
	Strongly influenced by the tradition of Utilitarianism—a political school of 
	thought, influenced by Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, which believed in 
	reform through rational administration—he brought about important changes in 
	the administrative structure of India, such as an end to discrimination in 
	public service recruitment, adoption of a liberal attitude toward the press, 
	and the far-reaching measure of making English the official language of 
	India. Although he followed a policy of nonintervention in the day-to-day 
	running of Indian states, he annexed Mysore, Coorg, and central Cachar. He 
	abolished the practice of female infanticide prevalent among some Rajput 
	tribes. Indian reformers such as Raja Rammohan Roy (1772–1833) advocated 
	abolition of the sati system (the custom of burning widows alive with the 
	dead bodies of their husbands). In Regulation of XVII of December 1829, 
	Bentinck declared sati illegal. However, this has not been as easy task and 
	he had to write constantly in the favor of reform.</span></font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">Whether the question 
	be to continue or to discontinue the practice of <i>sati, </i>the decision 
	is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the 
	consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and 
	untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which 
	no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, if 
	heretofore received opinions are to be considered of any value, to put to 
	hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India, 
	and to extinguish at once all hopes of those great improvements-affecting 
	the condition not of hundreds and thousands but of millions-which can only 
	be expected from the continuance of our supremacy, is <u>an alternative

	interesting analysis of the situation by Lord Bentinck-it is clear that he 
	was influenced by Mills and hence, he considered humanism as the supreme 
	objective. This is also a clear proof that proponents of Muslim personal 
	laws like Ziauddin and Setara Hashem are much behind Lord Bentinck and his 
	ideas in 1829. If not for anybody else, a Ram Mohan or a Lord Bentinck is 
	needed to baptize them with absolute value of humanism -BP</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">)</span><font size="3">., 
	the good of mankind, that the tolerance of this inhuman and impious rite can 
	in my opinion be justified on the part of the government of a civilized 
	nation. While the solution of this question is appalling from the 
	unparalleled magnitude of its possible results, the considerations belonging 
	to it are such as to make even the stoutest mind distrust its decision. On 
	the one side, Religion, Humanity, under the most appalling form, as well as 
	vanity and ambition-in short, all the most powerful influences over the 
	human heart-are arrayed to bias and mislead the judgment. On the other side, 
	the sanction of countless ages, <u>the example of all the Mussulman 
	conquerors</u> (</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">

	concurrence in the same policy of our own most able rulers, together with 
	the universal veneration of the people, seem authoritatively to forbid, both 
	to feeling and to reason, any interference in the exercise of their natural 
	prerogative. In venturing to be the first to deviate from this practice it 
	becomes me to show that nothing has been yielded to feeling<u>, but that

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">. . . So far from 
	being chargeable with political rashness, as this departure from an 
	established policy might infer, I hope to be able so completely to prove the 
	safety of the measures as even to render unnecessary any calculation of the 
	degree of risk which for the attainment of so great a benefit might wisely 
	and justly be incurred.... With the firm undoubting conviction entertained 
	upon this question, <u>I should be guilty of little short of the crime of 
	multiplied murder if I could hesitate in the performance of this solemn 
	obligation </u>&nbsp;(</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This<span style="COLOR: blue">

	general prohibition, resting altogether.&nbsp; Upon the moral goodness of the act 
	and our power to enforce it; and so decided is my feeling against any half 
	measure that, were I not convinced of the safety of total abolition, I 
	certainly should have advised the cessation of all interference. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">Of all those who have 
	given their advice against the abolition of the rite, and have described the 
	ill effects likely to ensue from it, there is no one to whom I am disposed 
	to pay greater deference than Mr. Horace Wilson </font>
	<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(<span style="COLOR: blue">This British was a 
	supporter of Sati and rumor goes that he was bribed by conservative Hindues. 
	Readers may find a similarity in recent Sharia debate-BP)</span></span><font size="3">. 
	I purposely select his opinion because, independently of his vast knowledge 
	of Oriental literature, it has fallen to his lot, as secretary to the Hindu 
	College, and possessing the general esteem both of the parents and of the 
	youths, to have more confidential intercourse with natives of all classes 
	than any man in India. While his opportunity of obtaining information has 
	been great beyond all others, his talents and judgement enable him to form a 
	just estimate of its value. I shall state the most forcible of his reasons, 
	and how far I do and do not agree with him. </font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">1st. Mr. Wilson considers 
	it to be a dangerous evasion of the real difficulties to attempt to prove 
	that <i>satis </i>are not &quot;essentially a part of the Hindu religion.&quot; I 
	entirely agree in this opinion. The question is not what the rite is but 
	what it is supposed to be, and I have no doubt that the conscientious belief 
	of every order of Hindus, with few exceptions, regards it as sacred. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">2nd. Mr. Wilson 
	thinks that the attempt to put down the practice will inspire extensive 
	dissatisfaction. I agree also in this opinion. He thinks that success will 
	only be partial, which I doubt. He does not imagine that the promulgated 
	prohibition will lead to any immediate and overt act of insubordination, but 
	that affrays and much agitation of the public mind must ensue. But he 
	conceives that, if once they suspect that it is the intention of the British 
	Government to abandon this hitherto inviolate principle of allowing the most 
	complete toleration in matters of religion, there will arise in the minds of 
	all so deep a distrust of our ulterior designs that they will no longer be 
	tractable to any arrangement intended for their improvement, and that 
	principle of a purer morality, as well as of a more virtuous and exalted 
	rule of action, now actively inculcated by European education and knowledge, 
	will receive a fatal check. I must acknowledge that a similar opinion as the 
	probable excitation of a deep distrust of our future intentions was 
	mentioned to me in conversation by that enlightened native, Ram Mohun Roy, a 
	warm advocate for the abolition of <i>sati </i>and of all other 
	superstitions and corruptions engrafted on the Hindu religion, which he 
	considers originally to have been a pure Deism. It was his opinion that the 
	practice might be suppressed quietly and unobservedly by increasing the 
	difficulties and by the indirect agency of the police. He apprehended that 
	any public enactment would give rise to general apprehension, that the 
	reasoning would be, &quot;While the English were contending for power, they 
	deemed it politic to allow universal toleration and to respect our religion, 
	but having obtained the supremacy their first act is a violation ol their 
	profession, and the next will probably be, <u>like the Muhammadan 
	conquerors, to force upon us their own religion</u>.(</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue">Hindues 
	were always afraid - like Muslim rulers British would try to convert them as 
	well-BP)</span><font size="3">&quot; </font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Admitting, as I am always 
	disposed to do, that much truth is contained in these remarks, but not at 
	all assenting to the conclusions which, though not described, bear the most 
	unfavorable import, I shall now inquire into the evil and the extent of 
	danger which may practically result from this measure. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It must be first observed 
	that of the 463 <i>satis </i>occurring in the whole of the Presidency of 
	Fort William, 420 took place in Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, or what is termed 
	the Lower Provinces, and of these latter 287 in the Calcutta Division alone.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It might be very difficult 
	to make a stranger to India understand, much less believe, that in a 
	population of so many millions of people as the Calcutta Division includes, 
	and the same may be said of all the Lower Provinces, so great is the want of 
	courage and of vigour of character, and such the habitual submission of 
	centuries, that insurrection or hostile opposition to the will of the ruling 
	power may be affirmed to be an impossible danger.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">If, however, security was 
	wanting against extensive popular tumult or revolution, I should say that 
	the Permanent Settlement, which, though a failure in many other respects and 
	in its most important essentials, has this great advantage at least, of 
	having created a vast body of rich landed proprietors deeply interested in 
	the continuance of the British Dominion and having complete command over the 
	mass of the people.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Were the scene of this sad 
	destruction of human life laid in the Upper instead of the Lower Provinces, 
	in the midst of a bold and manly people, I might speak with less confidence 
	upon the question of safety. In these Provinces the <i>satis </i>amount to 
	forty­three only upon a population of nearly twenty millions. It cannot be 
	expected that any general feeling, where combination of any kind is so 
	unusual, could be excited in defense of a rite in which so few participate, 
	a rite also notoriously made too often subservient to views of personal 
	interest on the part of the other members of the family.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">But I have taken up too 
	much time in giving my own opinion when those of the greatest experience and 
	highest official authority are upon our records. In the report of the 
	Nizamat Adalat for 1828, four out of five of the Judges recommended to the 
	Governor­General in Council the immediate abolition of the practice, and 
	attest its safety. The fifth Judge, though not opposed to the opinions of 
	the rest of the Bench, did not feel then prepared to give his entire assent. 
	In the report of this year the measure has come up with the unanimous 
	recommendation of the Court.... No documents exist to show the opinions of 
	the public functionaires in the interior, but I am informed that nine­tenths 
	are in favour of the abolition.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Having made inquiries, 
	also, how far <i>satis </i>are permitted in the European foreign 
	settlements, I find from Dr. Carey that at Chinsurah no such sacrifices had 
	ever been permitted by the Dutch Government. That within the limits of 
	Chandarnagar itself they were also prevented, but allowed to be performed in 
	the British territories. The Danish Government of Serampur has not forbidden 
	the rite, in conformity to the example of the British Government. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It is a very important fact 
	that, though representations have been made by the disappointed party to 
	superior authority, it does not appear that a single instance of direct 
	opposition to the execution of the prohibitory orders of our civil 
	functionaries has ever occurred. How, then, can it be reasonably feared that 
	to the Government itself, from whom all authority is derived, and whose 
	power is now universally considered to be irresistible, anything bearing the 
	semblance of` resistance can be manifested? Mr. Wilson also is of opinion 
	that no immediate overt act of insubordination would follow the publication 
	of the edict. The Regulation of Government may be evaded, the police may be 
	corrupted, but even here the price paid as hush money will operate as a 
	penalty, indirectly forwarding the object of Government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">I venture, then, to think 
	it completely proved that from the native population nothing of extensive 
	combination, or even of partial opposition, may be expected from the 
	abolition.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">I have now to submit for 
	the consideration of Council the draft of a regulation enacting the 
	abolition of <i>satis.... </i>It is only in the previous processes, or 
	during the actual performance of the rite, when the feelings of all may be 
	more or less roused to a high degree of excitement, that I apprehend the 
	possibility of affray or of acts of violence through an indiscreet and 
	injudicious exercise of authority. It seemed to me prudent, therefore, that 
	the police, in the first instance, should warn and advise, but not forcibly 
	prohibit, and if the <i>sati, </i>in defiance of this notice, were 
	performed, that a report should be made to the magistrate, who would summon 
	the parties and proceed as in any other case of crime.... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3"><u>The first and 
	primary object of my heart is the benefit of the Hindus. I know nothing so 
	important to the improvement of their future condition as the establishment 
	of a purer morality, whatever their belief, and a more just conception of 
	the will of God. The first step to this better understanding will be 
	dissociation of religious belief and practice from blood and murder</u>

	amazing, how he was ahead of his time “dissociation of belief and practice

	They will then, when no longer under this brutalizing excitement, view with 
	more calmness acknowledged truths. They will see that there can be no 
	inconsistency in the ways of Providence, that to the command received as 
	divine by all races of` men, &quot;No innocent blood shall be spilt,&quot; there can 
	be no exception; and when they shall have been convinced of the error of

	and that, thus emancipated from those chains and shackles upon their minds 
	and actions, they may no longer continue, as they have done, the slaves of 
	every foreign conqueror, but that they may assume their first places among 
	the great families of mankind? I disown in these remarks, or in this 
	measure, any view whatever to conversion to our own faith. I write and feel 
	as a legislator for the Hindus, and as I believe many enlightened Hindus

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Descending from these 
	higher considerations, it cannot be a dishonest ambition that the Government 
	of which I form a part should have the credit of an act which is to wash out 
	a foul stain upon British rule, and to stay the sacrifice of humanity and 
	justice to a doubtful expediency; and finally, as a branch of the general 
	administration of the Empire, I may be permitted to feel deeply anxious that 
	our course shall be in accordance with the noble example set to us by the 
	British Government at home, and that the adaptation, when practicable to the 
	circumstances of this vast Indian population, of the same enlightened 
	principles, may promote here as well as there the general prosperity, and 
	may exalt the character of our nation.</font></p>
