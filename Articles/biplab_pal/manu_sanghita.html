  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Manu Sanghita: Chapter 9 [ On duties in a marriage ] (Translation 
  G. Buhler)</strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Verdana">CHAPTER IX</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. I will now propound the 
  eternal laws for a husband and his wife who keep to the path of duty, whether 
  they be united or separated. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. 
  Day and night woman must be kept in dependence by the males (of) their 
  (families), and, <font style="background-color: #ff7f00">if they attach 
  themselves to sensual enjoyments</font>, they must be kept under one's 
  control. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">( Clearly Manu believed that it is 
  men's duty to imprison women's sensuality &amp; sexuality...-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.<font style="background-color: #ff007f"> 
  Her father protects (her) in childhood, her husband protects (her) in youth, 
  and her sons protect (her) in old age; a woman is never fit for independence</font>.
  </font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">(And that great duty of guarding 
  women's sexuality be carried out by her father when she is young, by her 
  husband when she is grown up, and by her son when she is matured....-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. 
  Reprehensible is the father who gives not (his daughter in marriage) at the 
  proper time; reprehensible is the husband who approaches not (his wife in due 
  season), and reprehensible is the son who does not protect his mother after 
  her husband has died. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. 
  Women must particularly be guarded against evil inclinations, however trifling 
  (they may appear); for, if they are not guarded,
  <font style="background-color: #ffff00">they will bring sorrow on two 
  families. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">(Indication is subtle and clear..if 
  you allow women's liberty, they will ruin the reputation of the family by 
  adulterous relationship..-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. 
  Considering that the highest duty of all castes, even weak husbands (must) 
  strive to guard their wives. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. 
  He who carefully guards his wife, preserves (the purity of) his offspring, 
  virtuous conduct, his family, himself, and his (means of acquiring) merit.
  </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. 
  The husband, after conception by his wife, becomes an embryo and is born again 
  of her; for that is the wifehood of a wife (gaya), that he is born (gayate) 
  again by her. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. 
  As the male is to whom a wife cleaves, even so is the son whom she brings 
  forth; let him <font style="background-color: #ff0000">therefore carefully 
  guard his wife, in order to keep his offspring pure.&nbsp;</font><font size="+0">&nbsp;
  <em>(I am sure Richard Dockins, must have got enough clue on his selfish 
  Gene-BP)</em></font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  10. No man can completely guard women by force; but they can be guarded by the 
  employment of the (following) expedients: </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  11. Let the (husband) employ his (wife) in the collection and expenditure of 
  his wealth, <font style="background-color: #ff0000">in keeping (everything) 
  clean, in (the fulfilment of) religious duties, in the preparation of his 
  food, and in looking after the household utensils.</font><font size="+0">&nbsp; (<em>vow, 
  Manu said , lets treat your wife as maid servant to keep her busy..readers, do 
  you have any explanation?</em> -BP)</font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  12. <font style="background-color: #ff4040">Women, confined in the house under 
  trustworthy and obedient servants, are not (well) gu</font>arded; but those 
  who of their own accord keep guard over themselves, are well guarded. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><em>(I liked it!!! So kind...Thou Manu 
  said &quot; Man, imprison your wife&quot; -BP)</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  13. <font style="background-color: #ff9f40">Drinking (spirituous liquor), 
  associating with wicked people, separation from the husband, rambling abroad, 
  sleeping (at unseasonable hours), and dwelling in other men's houses, are the 
  six causes of the ruin of women.</font> </font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">(Thou Manu Said, women will be fallen 
  from their virue as soon as they will drink or separate from their 
  husband...etc..-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  14. Women do not care for beauty, nor is their attention fixed on age; 
  (thinking), '(It is enough that) he is a man,'
  <font style="background-color: #ff7f00">they give themselves to the handsome 
  and to the ugly. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">(Apperanatly Manu was an ugly person 
  and therefore thought woman will like a man as long as he is sexually 
  capable...I am delighted at Manu's revealation-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  15. Through their passion for men, through their mutable temper, through their
  <font style="background-color: #ffff00">natural heartlessness</font>, they 
  become <font style="background-color: #ffff00">disloyal towards their husbands</font>, 
  however carefully they may be guarded in this (world). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><em>(clearly Manu might have been slapped 
  by some women when he approached for sex--so he thought women are 'natural' 
  heartless creature-BP)</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  16. Knowing their disposition, which the Lord of creatures laid in them at the 
  creation, to be such, (every) <font style="background-color: #ff4040">man 
  should most strenuously exert himself to guard them. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">( Because women are disloyal in 
  general, a man must force her to live with him..Any better explanation dear 
  readers?-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  17. (When creating them) <font style="background-color: #ff4040">Manu allotted 
  to women (a love of their) bed, (of their) seat and (of) ornament, impure 
  desires, wrath, dishonesty, malice, and bad conduct. </font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><em>( Does Mr Raman Shah and Mr Kalyan 
  Panda think of same about their mom, wife and sisters? -BP)</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  18. For women no (sacramental) rite (is performed) with sacred texts, thus the 
  law is settled; women (who are) destitute of strength and destitute of (the 
  knowledge of) Vedic texts, (are as impure as) falsehood (itself), that is a 
  fixed rule. </font></p>
  <font face="Verdana">
  <p align="left"><em>(&nbsp;If this is not discrimination against women what is 
  called discrimination Mr Shah?? Do you have a separate dictionary?&nbsp;-BP)</em></p>
  </font>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  19. And to this effect many sacred texts are sung also in the Vedas, in order 
  to (make) fully known the true disposition (of women); hear (now those texts 
  which refer to) the expiation of their (sins). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  20. <font style="background-color: #ff8080">'If my mother, going astray and 
  unfaithful, conceived illicit desires, may my father keep that seed from me,</font>' 
  that is the scriptural text. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">(This is the most unbearable and 
  painful part-Manu even didn't leave our mothers..Mr Panda? Do you love your 
  mother? -BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  21. If a woman thinks in her heart of anything that would pain her husband, 
  the (above-mentioned text) is declared (to be a means for) completely removing 
  such infidelity. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  22. Whatever be the qualities of the man with whom a woman is united according 
  to the law, such qualities even she assumes, like a river (united) with the 
  ocean. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  23. Akshamala, a woman of the lowest birth, being united to Vasishtha and 
  Sarangi, (being united) to Mandapala, became worthy of honour. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  24. These and other females of low birth have attained eminence in this world 
  by the respective good qualities of their husbands. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  25. Thus has been declared the ever pure popular usage (which regulates the 
  relations) between husband and wife; hear (next) the laws concerning children 
  which are the cause of happiness in this world and after death. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  26. Between wives (striyah) who (are destined) to bear children, who secure 
  many blessings, who are worthy of worship and irradiate (their) dwellings, and 
  between the goddesses of fortune (sriyah, who reside) in the houses (of men), 
  there is no difference whatsoever. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  27. The production of children, the nurture of those born, and the daily life 
  of men, (of these matters) woman is visibly the cause. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  28. Offspring, (the due performance on religious rites, faithful service, 
  highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself, 
  depend on one's wife alone. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  29. She who, controlling her thoughts, speech, and acts, violates not her duty 
  towards her lord, dwells with him (after death) in heaven, and in this world 
  is called by the virtuous a faithful (wife, sadhvi) </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  30. <font style="background-color: #ff7f00">But for disloyalty to her husband 
  a wife is censured among men, and (in her next life) she is born in the womb 
  of a jackal</font> and tormented by diseases, the punishment of her sin.
  </font></p>
  <p align="left"><em><font face="Verdana">( So womb of a woman does belong to 
  her!!!-BP)</font></em></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  31. Listen (now) to the following holy discussion, salutary to all men, which 
  the virtuous (of the present day) and the ancient great sages have held 
  concerning male offspring. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  32. They (all) say that the male issue (of a woman) belongs to the lord, but 
  with respect to the (meaning of the term) lord the revealed texts differ; some 
  call the begetter (of the child the lord), others declare (that it is) the 
  owner of the soil. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  33. By the sacred tradition the woman is declared to be the soil, the man is 
  declared to be the seed; the production of all corporeal beings (takes place) 
  through the union of the soil with the seed. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  34. In some cases the seed is more distinguished, and in some the womb of the 
  female; but when both are equal, the offspring is most highly esteemed. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  35. On comparing the seed and the receptacle (of the seed), the seed is 
  declared to be more important; for the offspring of all created beings is 
  marked by the characteristics of the seed. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  36. Whatever (kind on seed is sown in a field, prepared in due season, (a 
  plant) of that same kind, marked with the peculiar qualities of the seed, 
  springs up in it. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  37. This earth, indeed, is called the primeval womb of created beings; but the 
  seed develops not in its development any properties of the womb. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  38. In this world seeds of different kinds, sown at the proper time in the 
  land, even in one field, come forth (each) according to its kind. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  39. The rice (called) vrihi and (that called) sali, mudga-beans, sesamum, 
  masha-beans, barley, leeks, and sugar-cane, (all) spring up according to their 
  seed. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  40. That one (plant) should be sown and another be produced cannot happen; 
  whatever seed is sown, (a plant of) that kind even comes forth. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  41. Never therefore must a prudent well-trained man, who knows the Veda and 
  its Angas and desires long life, cohabit with another's wife. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  42. With respect to this (matter), those acquainted with the past recite some 
  stanzas, sung by Vayu (the Wind, to show) that seed must not be sown by (any) 
  man on that which belongs to another. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  43. As the arrow, shot by (a hunter) who afterwards hits a wounded (deer) in 
  the wound (made by another), is shot in vain, even so the seed, sown on what 
  belongs to another, is quickly lost (to the sower). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  44. (Sages) who know the past call this earth (prithivi) even the wife of 
  Prithu; they declare a field to belong to him who cleared away the timber, and 
  a deer to him who (first) wounded it. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  45. He only is a perfect man who consists (of three persons united), his wife, 
  himself, and his offspring; thus (says the Veda), and (learned) Brahmanas 
  propound this (maxim) likewise, 'The husband is declared to be one with the 
  wife.' </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  46. <font style="background-color: #ff4040">Neither by sale nor by repudiation
