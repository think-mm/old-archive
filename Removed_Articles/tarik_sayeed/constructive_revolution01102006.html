															Our country is 
															nothing but 
															marginal, defective 
															and defensive about 
															its corrupted 
															political system. 
															Corruption has 
															always been and 
															continues to be our 
															most powerful 
															grievances. Does our 
															country need an 
															uprising to break 
															the existing 
															political system? I 
															think so and do not 
															think there is any 
															other road but 
															revolution. The 
															dynamics to start a 
															revolution already 
															exists in our 
															country. What we 
															need is a real 
															revolutionary 
															process aiming to 
															overturn the 
															existing political 
															and economic order. 
															The future for poor 
															Bengalis at present 
															is very dark but it 
															can be changed. In 
															order to start a 
															revolutionary war we 
															need to locate the 
															“invisible” power 
															against which 
															Bengalis can make a 
															revolution. It needs 
															to turn to a great 
															number of people who 
															are deprived. More 
															than half of our 
															country is in this 
															mass. As Karl Marx 
															stated, this is the 
															“dangerous” class</font><span style="font-size: 12pt"><a title name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><sup><sup><font face="Verdana" size="3">[i</font><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><font face="Verdana" size="3">]</font></span></sup></sup></span></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">. </span></font></span></font>

															hungry, poor, 
															malnourished and 
															most important 
															stripped out of

															135 million is in

															Let us consider the

															The majority of the

															countries’ 
															capitalist 
															structure. We are 
															working hard to 
															elevate our social 
															class. We are 
															working for 
															corporations whose 
															main objective is to 
															make profit. 
															However, by the time 
															we are in our 40’s 
															we realize all we 
															did was work in a 
															system that 
															systematically takes 
															our money away. In 
															practicality, there 
															is no middle class 
															in the western 
															world; it is just a 
															false impression. 
															Did we forget that 
															every class struggle 
															is a political 
															struggle?&nbsp; In 
															contrast, the 
															readers in <ST1>
															Bangladesh</ST1> are 
															a part of a 
															bourgeois society 
															that repudiates to 
															have a normal life 
															without servants. 
															The proletariat or 
															the lower class in <ST1>
															Bangladesh</ST1> 
															goes through various 
															stages of resistance 
															like we do in the 
															western world. At 
															the end, only to 
															find themselves in 
															not only a class 
															struggle, but an 
															imperceptible 
															political struggle 
															as well. 
															Intellectuals like 
															you need to 
															understand that 
															there is still a 
															small emotional gap 
															between the 
															proletariat and the 
															poor. Both classes 
															joined together 
															could be an uprising

															There are a number

															poverty is allowing 
															the reproduction of

															According to their 
															website, they 
															claimed they were

															had no fixed 
															contracts, no 
															security, and no 
															basis for
