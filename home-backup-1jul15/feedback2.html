          <p>It is so heartening to hear appreciation for our immense spirtual
          treasure trove. For your information, Miroslav, a very learned man
          from near your country, Mircea Eliade from Rumania, spent 3 years in
          Calcutta, studying Sanskrit and Indian philosophy and spent 6 months
          in the Himalayas practicing yoga. He has written some books on Indian
          philosophy, mostly in French.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><tt>&nbsp;</tt>Dear Friends,</p>
          <p>&nbsp;I have found Your site by chance. For a Note: I live in Czech
          Republic. I am lovely surprised of the opportunity to connect to the
          site respected Your trimendous cultural sphere. The Indian spiritual
          heritage contents the Truth. I was contact with them by reading some
          literature, however not in original languages, which I do not know,
          but in the Czech langauge editions only. The first I found was the
          Bhagavatgita translated by Mr. Janicek in Prague City to the Czech
          language. I have a profound Respect to the Truth mediated by Your
          Doctrines in the Indian Continent. Being emphasized to the spiritual
          motion, I respect Your resources of the Knowledge, and on the other
          side of the matter, I seen Your orientation to the &quot;West&quot;
          forms of the attitude to the Being. That makes a surprise to me. I
          respect You (the East), and You respect the West. Being born in one of
          the European Countries laying in the direction to West from Your India
          Continent, I know, the Europe is not so considerable Area for the
          spiritual living. The developing of the European Thinking is fully of
          Contrasts, and fully of fights Actions between persons, representing
          different Oppinions. For last two centuries only happened, the fights
          are less ferocious. Last century has been under influence of falling
          trends of the interest for the spirituality. Your contact to the
          European a USA civilisation was founded on the Roots from the more
          recent centuries, when the spiritual interests was more strictly. The
          heritage of ancient Times is present to the Nowadays. Let look to the
          reality in the Living of People in the &quot;West&quot; Contries. I am
          triste seeing Films in which is many violence, leaking blood and shuts
          from guns, but less of the Prayers, meditation, devotion or some Acts
          of the Religion. In my country lives one she-Yogi, and She expressed
          the characteristic: &quot;..rozklada se zevnitr...&quot;, (I try to
          translate : &quot;.. this is destruction processed inner (from within)
          ...&quot;). However, reading documensts concerning the
          &quot;Eastern&quot; knowledge I feel the Pleasure impressed by the
          touch of the Truth.&nbsp;</p>

          Date: Mon Jan 27, 2003 8:07 am<br>
          Subject: <b>Nourishing Mukto-mona and Bengali Renaissance</b></p>
          <p>Dr. Jaffor Ullah saheb's translations of Meghdoot, with the
          wonderful pictures of the cloud were really uplifting. <font color="#FF0000">It
          also made me feel about the tremendous possibilities of Mukto-mona;
          not just a forum for discussing the merits and demerits of RSS and BNP,
          and the various atrocities - not to say they are not important. Of
          course the occasional diversions on Ila Mitra Annadashankar Roy and
          others particularly by Prof. Ajoy Roy were really 'nourishing'. All
          this gave me an incentive to my piece below. Please forgive me if you
          find it worthless or boring.</font></p>
          <p>Recently, I have been reading the book: Renaissance by the eminent
          historian Paul Johnson. The far reaching influence of the fourteenth
          and fifteenth century Europe: Dante, Boccacio, Chaucer, Davinci,
          really left a deep impression on me, particularly the wide range of
          areas - literature, art, sculpture, buildings - left such an indelible
          mark for years tocome. I was suddenly reminded of something by Nirad
          C. Chaudhuri (my idol!) I had read, where he indicated a comparable
          glorious era for the Bengalees. It appears that nearly all the greats
          were born in the nineteenth century, and reached their peaks by the
          1930s - the effect of the newfound interaction with the
          British/Western influence cannot be denied.</p>
          <p>But what a train of lumineries they were, in a wide array of human
          endeavour! I have humbly tried to make a small list of these
          luminaries, whose stamp has not only been deeply imprinted in the two
          Banglas, but often in the whole subcontinent,and sometimes to the
          world beyond. Here is my list (in no particular order:</p>
          <p>Raja Rammohan Roy (pioneer in everything) Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
          (educationist, social reformer) Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (author,
          Hindu revivalist - Bande Mataram, great intellectual) Michael
          Madhusudan Dutt (pioneer poet) Girish Chandra Ghosh (pioneer dramatist
          and actor) Sarat Chandra Chatterjee (athor par excellence)
          Rabindranath Tagore (who is he?) Chittaranjan Das (great political
          leader and Philanthrophist) Surendranath Banerjee (pioneering national
          leader - India League) Manabendranath (M.N.) Roy9 founder of communist
          party, worked with Lenin, revolution in Mexico) Bipin Chandra
          Pal(pioneer political leader - Lal-Bal-Pal) Vivekananda (spirttual
          leader, social reformer par excellence) Keshab Chandra Sen (legendary
          leader of Brahmo Samaj) Subhas Chandra Bose(great patriot, political
          leader) Jagadish Chandra Bose(pioneer of science in India; inventor of
          diode for radio) Satyendranath Bose (scientist - Bose-Einstein
          Statistics) Meghnad Saha (astrophysicist - Saha limit) Nandalal Bose
          (great artist) Gaganendra Nath Tagore(great artist) Abanindra Nath
          Tagore (great artist) Dwijendralal Roy(poet, dramatist - Dhana dhanye
          --) Profulla Chandra Roy (pioneer chemist and industrialist) Ashutosh
          Mukherjee (educationist- put Calcutta University in the world map)
          Suniti Kumar Chatterjee (pioneering philologist) Jadunath Sarkar
          (pioneer historian) Aurobindo Ghosh (great political and spiritual
          leader) P. C. Mahalanobis (pioneer stasticiac; founder of ISI) Ramesh
          Chandra Majumdar (historian, educationist) Kazi Nazrul Islam (great
          poet, patriot) Ustad Alauddin Khan (pioneer of Indian classical music)
          Muzaffar Ahmed (Kakababu)(pioneer and legendary communist party
          leader) Nirad C. Chaudhuri (fearless author) Nabin Chandra Das
          (inventor of rosogolla)</p>
          <p>As a personal prerogative, I did not include the name of Ramkrishna
          Paramhansa. To me he is a god-man in the same level as Buddha, Christ
          or Mohammed. I ask the reader's consideration for this idiosyncrasy.</p>
          <p>A list such as this is obviously subjective. I am sure to some, I
          have left out a few names and some of those listed do not belong. But
          the overall message is undeniable. I can think of very few, born in
          the next century to measure up to the same stature: definitely
          Satyajit Ray, Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman and perhaps Amartya Sen.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dear Abhijit and Charbak,</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I have been browsing through 
          the mail I received during the last fortnight and was fascinated by 
          the nature of the discussion as well as by the amount of tolerance and 
          restraints showed by participants, particularly in religious matters.&nbsp; 
          It seems the name Mukto-Mona does bear some meaning.<span>&nbsp; </span>
          However, I thought that the discussions are too wide ranging. &nbsp;I 
          sincerely believe that fewer topics and more in-depth discussion would 
          be more useful. Perhaps less politics and more social and cultural 
          issues, including religious issues would be a better idea.<o></o></span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I noticed that an article on 
          Rokeya was published.&nbsp; In this connection, can I submit one of my 
          articles on Rokeya as well?<span>&nbsp; </span>Interested readers can find 
          it at the following address:
          <a href="http://www.murshid.co.uk/Rokeya.pdf">
          www.murshid.co.uk/Rokeya.pdf</a> </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I will soon post another 
          article called “Adarshabad O Manusher Samgkat” i.e. Idealism and the 
          Crisis of Humanity. &nbsp;In this article, I argue that idealism has 
          separated humans from other animals.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, when it 
          turns into dogmas it transforms humans back into animals.</span></p>

          </font></p>
          <p><font color="#0000FF">Peace be on those who follow the truth. I
          hope you are in good health.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#0000FF">I have read some of your writings long ago in
          NFB and after a few years later I am reading some of them in your
          homepage. I find the same tone, same accusations. So here I have a
          small question for you (in fact all others who think bashing religion
          is cool). Did you not ever find a good point in Islam (or in any other
          religion for that matter) that you can agree with? If so, would you
          sometimes mention those good points in your writeups? May be then your
          writings will look to be more balanced. If not, please do yourself a
          favor and stop concerning with something that cannot give you anything
          good and concern yourself with something more meaningful to you.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#0000FF">In this regard I must say that if you really
          like to learn Islam ( or in any other religion for that matter) you
          have to ask your questions one-by-one. Ask a question, get the
          answers, if those suit you then fine, if not then you are right in
          having doubt in that religion. But if you find an answer that seem to
          you to be logical, why don't you appreciate it and acknowledge it?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#0000FF">I may reply to some of your questions based
          on my limited knowledge, but I do not think you will be ever convinced
          by anybody if you are hell-bent on not seeing eye-to-eye. Anyway I
          appreciate your efforts to come up with difficult questions trying to
          get to the truth. In that way you should continue. But if you are not
          honest with your intentions, you might be losing something.</font></p>

          <p><b>Response:</b></p>
          <p>Response: History reveals that the consequences of beliefs have
          created mental barriers to understanding and has caused ignorance,
          misery, violence and war. MM site examines beliefs, faiths and
          superstitions to help become aware of their methodology and dangerous
          consequences. Most of the freethinkers like me consider religion to be
          not only untrue, but harmful as well. It has been used to justify war,
          slavery, sexism, racism, homophobia, mutilations, intolerance, and
          oppression of minorities, women and humanists for centuries over
          centuries. The totalitarianism of religious absolutes chokes progress.
          You see our homepage like that because we feel in such a way. If you
          are liberal or claim to be taught by Islamic/religious good teaching,
          then you have to accept those fact. MM has not been created to publish
          &quot;balanced&quot; view. MM is not a news media. To propagate
          balanced view is not our motto. We cannot be balanced or neutral when
          an option is given to choose between blind faith and reason,
          progressiveness and superstition, humanism and cruelty, science and
          dogmatism, right?</p>
          <p>Of course Religion also have good side that you might want to point
          out, but what I want to mention, Religion does not have a monopoly on
          good deeds. Most modern social and moral progress has been made by
          people free from religion--including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B.
          Anthony, Charles Darwin, Margaret Sanger, Albert Einstein, Andrew
          Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Marie Curie, H. L. Mencken, Sigmund Freud,
          Bertrand Russell, Luther Burbank, Ahmed Shariff, Aroj Ali Matubbar,
          Humayun Azad and many others who have enriched humanity.</p>

          <p>Please be assured that I am learning and updating myself
          continuously. Freethinking and Rationalist approach is reasonable for
          me rather than blind belief. It allows me to do my own thinking. A
          plurality of individuals thinking, free from restraints of orthodoxy,
          allows ideas to be tested, discarded or adopted. Whenever I find the
          answer, I accept- dont worry about that;&nbsp; whereas in your case,
          you tend to believe without caring any reason. Reason is a tool of
          critical thought that limits the truth of a statement according to the
          strict tests of the scientific method. Most of the times believers
          ignores this truth. They cannot form their opinions about religion
          independently of tradition, authority, or established belief.</p>

          <p>You are most well-come. Be my guest! I know that the store of human
          knowledge and understanding is constantly growing. Some of today's
          beliefs will be swept away for better ideas tomorrow just as some of
          yesterday's ideas have been replaced by today's knowledge. If you can
          come with a better argument to refute me, why shouldn't I accept?</p>

          This site has a secular perspective. The forum is where most of the
          action is.
          <p>The contributors are mainly but not exclusively Bangladeshi,
          Bengali and Indian and the topics largely concerned with South Asia
          and religious/secular debate. There are a large number of extreme left
          contributors who form perhaps the consensus political view. Some quite
          original and articulate anti-fundamentalist religion voices are well
          represented although defenders of Islam and Hinduism from critiques
          are there too.
          <p>Overall the site offers a very valuable forum for the free exchange
          of views which is the essence of the democratic model.
          <p>The level of debate ranges from lousy to brilliant and one needs to
          be a bit patient reading through the articles to find occasionally
          some quite original and intelligent articles.
