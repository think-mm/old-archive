			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Reference to moderator's note to 
			MM message # 31515. Fundamenatalism by defination is the point of 
			view characterized by rigid adherence to basic principles. MM is 
			rigid regarding atheism and pioner of abusing Islam. This is what a 
			ordinary reader like me have gathered from the articles writen by 
			the famous writers of MM like M/s Avijit, Abul Kasem, Mehul Kamder, 
			Kisan and others. Secularism is non-interference of religion and a 
			secularist considers religion as personal affair. Materialists are 
			freethinker and progressive. Rigid theism and atheism are 
			fundamentalistic idea, both belongs to idealistic group, which is 
			against materialism. Materialistic people are called rationalist. 
			Science deals with matter, whereas belief in creator resides in the 
			human mind, which has nothing to do with science. Whose who bring 
			religion in discussion of science, are nothing but fool i.e oggo. 
			Mr. Avijit talks about sciene, but violets basic principle of matter 
			during analysis. An engineer may know his subject, but he was not 
			taught to give comments on other subjects of natural or social 
			science unless he acquires knowledge of universal tool of analysis 
			of subject. Evolution of religion in history had a reason, so a 
			rationalist does not abuse religion but analyses religion in the 
			perspective of history and to do that he has to acquaint with the 
			basic knowledge of anthropology and philosophy. Every branch of 
			knowledge has its own domain and tools to analyse. Religion is not 
			in the domain of science. To give comments on other subjects, one 
			should has to acquire knowledge on dialectic materialism, which is 
			the universal tool to analyse a phenomena. My basic degree was in 
			physics and post graduate degree in information technology from a 
			foreign country. My job was planning. I was a student of Mr. 
			Avijit's father. During student life I was associated with 
			materialistic minded people who taught me the basic of anthropology, 
			history, philosophy, economics and to analyse phenomena they taught 
			me dialectic of materialism. As a son of a progressive teacher, I 
			had a higher expectation on Mr. Avijit but he is suffering from ego 
			and rigid in atheism, does not bother for the sentiment of common 
			people. I tried to make him understand, but he started blaming me. 
			So I had to quit MM. Still he is blaming me. Mr. Moderator has used 
			Mr./Ms. before Setara Hashem. As a man of sub-continent he should 
			know the gender of name Setara Hashem. Moreover one should know 
			person's views and ideology does not depends on gender. Mr. Avijit, 
			you do not have that sense also. Your write-up will indicate what 
			you are?So please don't blame me, try to understand, what I am 
			saying and try to follow it. Do not place me in your enemy side. I

					Democratic secular humanism has been proven to be a powerful 
					force in world culture. Its ideals can be traced to the 
					philosophers, scientists, and poets of classical Greece and 
					Rome, to ancient Chinese Confucian society, to the Carvaka 
					movement of India, and to other distinguished intellectual 
					and moral traditions. This philosophy has creatively 
					flowered in modern times with the growth of freedom and 
					democracy. Countless millions of thoughtful persons have 
					espoused secular humanist ideals, have lived significant 
					lives, and have contributed to the building of a more humane 
					and democratic world. I follow that path of secular humanism 
					by choice (to clarify, Secular humanists accept a world view 
					or philosophy called naturalism, in which the physical laws 
					of the universe are not superseded by non-material or 
					supernatural entities such as demons, gods, or other 
					&quot;spiritual&quot; beings outside the realm of the natural 
					universe; kindly read Susan Jacoby's 'Freethinkers : A 
					History of American Secularism' for reference). I do not 
					criticize if anyone keep his faith (whatever it is) in 
					personal level. But being a&nbsp; rationalist I find a problem if 
					someone comes publicly to &quot;prove&quot; his faith scientific. My 
					intention is not to hurt anybody but to critically examine 
					their arguments. Many renowned scientists and philosophers 
					including Bertrand Russell, Richard Dawkins, Victor Stenger, 
					Michael Shermer, Mark Perakh, Paul Kurtz, Paul Edwards, 
					Richard Carrier,&nbsp; Niall Shanks, Matt Young, Eugenie C. 
					Scott, Austin Dacey, Ahmed Sharif, Humayun Azad,&nbsp; Prabir 
					Ghosh, Bhabani Prasad Sahu, Joyantanuj Bondopadhay, James 
					Randi and many others have been&nbsp; following the same principle. I don't think 
					they all became &quot;fundamentalist&quot; by refuting apologist's 
					pseudo-scientific and religious arguments. </font></div>

					<b><font size="3">Response: </font></b><font size="3">That's 
					what is your view. I don't see the world in this way.&nbsp; 
					Atheism basically exists because of the existence of 
					theistic arguments and ideas, not vise versa. By examining 
					the components of the word 'atheism,' we can see this more 
					clearly. The word is made up of 'a-' and '-theism.' The root 
					word theism, we will all agree, is a belief in a God or 
					gods. The prefix 'a-' can mean 'not' (or 'no') or 'without.' 
					If it means 'not,' then we have as an atheist someone who is 
					not a theist (i.e., someone who does not have a belief in a 
					God or gods). If it means 'without,' then an atheist is 
					someone without theism, or without a belief in God. In 
					Bangla Nastik also can be broken into two parts:&nbsp; Na-Astik.&nbsp; 
					So atheism by definition is not any &quot;fundamentalist idea&quot; 
					nor a &quot;belief&quot;, rather its the rejection of theism.

					<font size="3">A study 
					by the FFRF found that over 90% of the atheists who 
					responded became atheists because religion did not work for 
					them. They had found that religious beliefs were

					denial; they are unbelievers through choice. The vast 
					majority of them have spent time studying one or more 
					religions, sometimes in very great depth. They have made a 
					careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs. 
					There are a number of books which lay out a philosophical 
					justification for atheism, such as Bertrand Russell's &quot;Why I

					a day long seminar. You can still find

					<font size="3">Again, sorry to disappoint you for not 
					fulfilling your high &quot;expectation&quot;. Common people's 
					sentiment is vague term for me. I work for scientific truth, 
					not to protect lie for the sake of sentiment of &quot;common 
					people&quot;.&nbsp; When theory of evolution was suggested thru the 
					work of Darwin and Wallace, it indeed hurt the &quot;common 
					sentiment&quot; of people. For example, when Bishop of 
					Birmingham's wife heard about Darwin's theory in 1880, she 
					said to her husband, &quot;My dear let us hope it is not true; 
					but if it is true, let us hope it will not become generally 
					known&quot;. Hurting common people's sentiment is not a very 
					sound argument to me for not to tell the fact to common 
					people. We all are hurting peoples' sentiments by 
					propagating our views anyways. For example, a supporter of Awamileague is always hurting BNP supporter's feelings, 
					leftists are hurting right wing group's sentiments, a 
					creationist is hurting evolutionist's feelings, a democrat 
					is hurting a autocrats sentiment etc. This is the beauty of 
					democracy that everybody can criticize any ideology if 
					he/she is obliged to. But religion is so entrenched in our 
					society that its proponents have been able to foist off onto 
					popular culture the notion that religion always deserves kid 
					glove treatment. But many like us think there is no rational 
					basis for providing religious dogma with its own special 
					exemption from harsh criticism especially when they deserves 
					that. Let me give some examples of hurting peoples 
					sentiment&nbsp; vs. propagation of scientific truth. British 
					Biologist&nbsp; T. H. Huxley (1825 -95) who was an ardent 
					propagator of evolution theory, many times uttered that 
					theory of evolution smashed all those colorful myths of&nbsp; 
					religion - &quot;slaying of beautiful hypothesis by an ugly 
					fact&quot;. However,&nbsp; he decided to defend evolution as it was a 
					scientific fact never mind about the common people's 
					sentiment or belief. Same thing was done by Copernicus, 
					Galileo or Bruno, even though their scientific findings hurt 
					the common peoples sentiment. I am sure that you are not 
					suggesting that Copernicus, Darwin or Galileo would hide 
					their scientific finding for the sake of &quot;sentiment&quot; of 
					common people! In fact it should work in the other way. 
					Facts should be disclosed impersonally in order to remove 
					superstition and blind belief from the society. This is how 
					society advances. </font></div>

			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Very true. I think Marxism /

			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Avijit, </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Let me take your arguments a few 
			steps forward ( Don't waste your time to argue with somebody 
			completely void of any basic background in any subject). </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">I guess the real argument is, are 
			we separating ourselves by promoting atheism? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Remember, Buddhism, Jainism are 
			also atheism. Baisanavite, Saibaite philosophy or Hinduism in 
			general at higher level also speak of atheism. Unfortunately 99.99% 
			followers of the said Hindu sects are theist because they do not 
			have basic understanding of their own religion. Even in Islam, the 
			superior version of religion is Sufism which is another form of 
			atheism. Indeed, mystiques of all ages considered atheism as natural 
			choice of human life-deism is rather a socio-political order and has 
			always been considered as limitation for realization and evolution 
			of human mind and traits. Tons of Sufi, Sahajia, Adyatabadi, 
			Buddhist literature spoke of this truth-oppressive nature of deism.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Hence, deism of any religion 
			should be viewed rather as a political ideology which has very 
			little to do with spiritualism or development of self. It served the 
			evolutionary purpose of socio- political integration (and still 
			serving the same in many other countries including America ) and 
			fighting its last battle in the form of political Islam. As such, if 
			you notice carefully, most of the modern religious movements are 
			based on spiritualism and not on deism. In India, deism is merely a 
			cultural celebration (Parivar is trying to find meaning out of it. 
			But how much of juice one can extract out of a symbolic paganism? ) 
			and reminiscent of its pagan heritage. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Therefore, it is wrong to think 
			that deism is the natural choice of common people and atheism is for 
			intellectuals only. Indeed, truth is -atheism is the normal choice 
			of human being because either the kids or the animals are atheist! 
			There is no doubt that socio- political system forces a human being 
			to be a deist by inculcating the fear of punishment and sins from 
			his childhood and therefore causing a permanent brain damage by 
			biasing the young minds towards deism. Deism can not survive without 
			a political system which is supporting or utilizing it, because it 
			is a by-product of socio- political evolution of human civilization. 
			Hence those who believe that individual practice of deism and 
			secularism can exist together, didn't understand the evolutionary 
			origin of deism. Deism and secularism can not exist together because 
			deism evolved by opposing secularism. Text of deism like Quran, 
			Bibble, ManuSmriti are full of hatred against secular ideas! Deism 
			can not exist without opposing the idea of secularism! It is 
			completely stupid to think that we can have true secular society 
			practicing deism. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">So fighting for atheism, means 
			fighting for our right to live as rational human being- whose mind 
			has grown up without any fear of sin and punishment of deism. 
			Governments must ban the religious ideas of sin and punishment 
			because such ideas cause unrecoverable damage of children's mind and 
			helps to fuel fundamentalism when religious parties exploit theist 
			existentialism crisis rooted in the teaching of sin and punishment. 
			This is a scientific fact. Hence, we must continue our fight against 
			oppressive deism to earn our dignity as human being. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Deism is a hidden political 
			ideology and we, the atheists, must oppose it politically. Makes no 
			mistake, it is our duty to eliminate deism in all forms. </font></p>

			<p align="justify"><font size="3">Dear Moderator, </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">I am a loyal reader of Mukto-Mona. 
			Although, not always I agree with everything what is expressed in 
			the articles in this site, I find Mukto-Mona as the most free forum 
			of free thinkers on the net. The questions from different 
			disciplines discussed here are serious and intended to help us to 
			form a better understanding of modern science as well as current 
			politics, particularly in Bangladesh. And off course, I find deep 
			satisfaction reading the literary sections (e.g., poems) of this 
			site. I am thinking how I could help MM to continue to grow. Likely, 
			I wouldn't be able to help monetarily, but will be happy to 
			contribute my time if that will of any help to MM. Please suggest 
			me. Briefly, I hold an MD degree from Russia, but declined to go to 
			practice medicine. Rather, I chose to be involved in basic science 
			research. Currently, I am a Research Associate in the University of 
			Virginia. So far I have published two scientific papers, however, 
			did not publish any scientific or political article for mass 
			readers. If you are interested in learning more about me, please 
			feel free to ask. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="3">I will be looking forward to 
			hearing from you soon. </font></p>
