  <font color="#ff0000" size="6"><b>G</b></font>ood day ladies and gentlemen. 
  This is your host Daniel Malloy bringing you live another edition of 
  &quot;Interview with a vampire&quot;. In today's show we have the pleasure to have a 
  vampire who stands in a class of his own. While my boss Anne Rice had for 
  years held onto the belief that a vampire sans his spiky teeth is not a real 
  vampire, our guest today has chiseled off that myth. Not only does he not have 
  spiky teeth, but also he has characteristics that are rather off-putting for 
  members of his own kind. He's as controversial among vampires as it can get.<br>
  <br>
  Particularly, our guest likes to spend a lot of time scavengering through 
  dictionaries to hand-pick obscure, fuzzy, 
  last-used-when-King-James-was-flagging-down-the-catholics words to lob them in 
  random places in his write-ups. Although he's possibly the best-known writer 
  in vampire populace, some of his contemporaries disagree citing his trite and 
  unimaginative cognitive outpouring in his writing. </p>
  <p>A vampire critique went so far as to comment &quot;His writing reflects how 
  badly mentally mutilated he is&quot;. It's also interesting to note that in our 
  last episode when we interviewed vampire biologist Dr. Wiltchblood, he 
  referred to our guest as an example of &quot;bad mutation&quot; in vampire evolution.
  </p>
  <p>No wonder then, our guest is popularly known as Sadistically Mutilated 
  Islam, or SMI in short. Without any further ado, let me introduce our guest 
  today Mr. SMI, ladies and gentlemen, please give him a big hand. <br>
  <font color="#008000"><i><b>[...clap&nbsp; clap track plays...]</b></i></font><br>
  <br>
  <b>DM </b>: It's a pleasure to have your here Mr. SMI.</p>
  <p><br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Thank you. I want to start off by reciting a poem that I've 
  written for the audience.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM :</b> Please go ahead.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> <font color="#008000"><i>It's dark around the corner<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's dark along the plains<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's dark that I need to garner<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And everything dark that remains.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bull that I think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bull that I write<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bull who of you blink<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And call me non-comprehendo and trite.<br>
  </i></font><br>
  <b>DM </b>: That was certainly a great start.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Wait, let me finish the last stanza.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#008000"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a grifter, I'm a grinder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm an agnostic punk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a callous-minded abuser<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I write a sh*t load of junk.</i></font><br>
  <br>
  <b>DM :</b> That was quite heavy-handed and self-biting, yet profound. Mr. SMI. 
  BTW, just to mention as a side note, I am spellbound by your extra ordinary 
  calibre as depicted in your last three write-ups published in NFB! I cannot 
  help but dedicate a poem for your brilliant pieces, Would you mind ?</p>
  <b>
  <p align="justify">SMI: </b>Which poem ?</p>
  <p>DM : the famous poem, 'aabol taabol' (gibberish) by my favourite poet 
  Sukumar Ray. Hope the readers of NFB would enjoy. </p>
  <p><br>
  <font color="#008000"><i><b>&quot;Ayre bhola kheyal khola<br>

  <p>BTW, would you like to tell us more about yourself, SMI?</p>
  <p><br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Daniel, if you're perspicacious enough ...</p>
  <p><br>
  <b>DM :</b> Wha, what? Perspi what?<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Ok, let me put it in an easier way, and I promise I will be easy 
  on you today. Now, if you attempt to comprehend the inherent meaning of that 
  poem, you will get your answer.</p>
  <p><br>
  <b>DM :</b> [...cough sound, followed by a goofy grin ...] I guess that helps. 
  Ok, Mr. SMI would you share with us your experience regarding your life as a 
  vampire.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI</b>: Daniel, I tell you it's tough as hell. Vampires can be as stubborn 
  and prosaic as humans. Let me give you an example. Over the last few months 
  I've been on a crusade to educate vampires about the importance of reading 
  low-quality, right-out-of-gutter articles; and in that regard my church 
  members are helping me out in scraping through the Internet to find articles 
  that make even the best samaritans remorseful. So far, I've forwarded more 
  articles to Internet forums and people than there're trees in Amazon. Yet, 
  Daniel, yet these vampires will not budge.<br>
  <br>
  <b>DM :</b> Let me interject for a minute. You said &quot;church members&quot;, but I 
  thought you're agnostic.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Yes Daniel, I am a pious agnostic. My parents named me Islam, 
  fearing I would lose faith when I grow up and douse myself in margarita pool. 
  While the inevitable has happened to some degree, you can rest assured I've 
  never lost my entire faith. In fact, I am more muslim than your everyday 
  run-of-the-mill muslim to the extent that while both of us slack our rituals, 
  I actively participate in nailing down everyone who critiques this great, 
  riveting, bolting, pegging, trouncing religion. Isn't that slick? <br>
  <br>
  <b>DM:</b> That certainly is. Mr. SMI, I've the May edition of &quot;Vampire 
  Magazine&quot; here, where your article &quot;Who invented X-droppings&quot; arose quite a 
  lot of controversy. Would you like to elaborate on that? <br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Well, insomuch as most people failed to hack through my 
  Shakespearean English in the article, it's imperative I clarify. See in my 
  youth I always used to dream about inventing something that I could patent 
  under my name. Finally, my dream came true when oneday I, quite 
  philosophically, and absolutely single- handedly, invented a new phrase 
  &quot;X-droppings&quot;, where X can be replaced with an animal name. </p>
  <p>The controversy arose when I went to patent on the phrase and the officer 
  refused stating some of my animal names could not be used. He particularly 
  objected to the sub-Saharian peacock owing to its being extinct now. It led to 
  my suing the patent office and losing it. But now I am taking the case to our 
  Supreme Court. <br>
  <br>
  DM: I must admit Mr. SMI, you're the most unique vampire I've ever come 
  across. One question- Have you heard the name of Farhad mazhar ?</p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI:</b> Yeah just two days ago.</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM</b>: Have you read any book/article of this particular author ?</p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI </b>: Yes -only that article which Omer Farook translated recently.</p>
  <p>DM: Hmmm… I see. But your rebuttal to veteran Shopon is just excellent, 
  especially without knowing any background of Mazhar and his ideology, without 
  reading any of his books, without having much involvement in geo-political 
  arena of your country ….</p>
  <p>SMI : But I only talked about the introductory part of Shopon where he 
  personally attacked my mentor (peace be upon him) Dr. Farook.</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM:</b> I see… So you have no interest on Mazhar’s article ? </p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI:</b> yeah.. you can say that.</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM:</b> Hmm… what is the relationship then between you and Dr. Farook ? </p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI:</b> the relationship that Jesus has with Lord, the relationship that 
  Muhammad had with Almighty, the relationship that Oedipus had with his …</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM:</b> OK Ok I understand. Forget it. Let’s come to the previous topic. 
  Another recent happening, you know that has surfaced in various places 
  suggests that you're at odds with a human being. I find this quite disturbing. 
  Allegations have been made that although he stepped off this incident, you are 
  still chugging along trying to provoke responses from him. Is that true? </p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI:</b> Absolutely, Daniel. You must realize my prominence and reputation 
  in vampire society. Sure enough, I ain't written an article or essay worth 
  reading by human beings in my entire life and a lot of the times I get the 
  spanking sensation that I don't know what I am talking about, but I deserve 
  better than having to see my intellectual backside whipped by a pity human who 
  claims to be an atheist. When uncle Joe told me to stay away from knowledgable 
  atheists I couldn't quite comprehend him. Now I know what he meant -- atheists 
  are criminals. Too bad, Mr. Avijit Roy wanted to come in my playfield, thump 
  me and get away without enticing a red- card. I say who the hell he think he 
  is, Al-Capon, or God, huh? <br>
  <br>
  <b>DM </b>: By definition, he cannot be a God, since he doesn't believe ...<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> Says who? Sometimes I get the feeling that he's a God believing 
  atheist, who's gone astray.<br>
  <br>
  <b>DM:</b> But, but, that's neither the academic nor the traditional meaning 
  of the word.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI</b>: Listen pal, I don't get what you say. I've an article here that I 
  got from <a href="http://www.bert-simpson-kicks-a$$.com,/t_blank">
  http://www.bert-simpson-kicks-a$$.com</a> where it clearly &nbsp;&nbsp; says atheists 
  are those who're non-theists. Since theists believe, in an invisible God, 
  non-theists then must believe in a visible God -- that's the only difference I 
  see.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#008000"><b><i>[ ... a hushed boo sound from the audience ...]</i></b></font><br>
  <br>
  <b>DM:</b> Let's change subject. You seem to be very concerned about PESUDONYM. 
  Can you please explain the background of some writers in your forum like – 
  Anundhuty Roy, Orundhoti Roy, ShoumYo_Murti, Golam Kibria, Mufti, Bula Kasem, 
  Pyro, Anonymous, Alaap Humorist, or even invisible &quot;Aalaap Team&quot; ?</p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI</b>: Invisible means ?</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM</b>: I mean do you have any other members in your team besides you? I 
  mean don’t you think it’s very odd to see that when you go for job… the entire 
  team cannot release any post ? (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2793">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2793</a> 
  )</p>
  <b>
  <p>SMI</b>: Don’t you think you’re committing Red Herring Fallacy ? You know 
  what my beloved Farida Aapaa advised me recently ? She said –<font color="#008000"><i> 
  &quot;You, Munir, on the other hand, should not have butted in without any 
  background knowledge and with your extremely offensive language that seems to 
  be stuck with a very limited vocabulary consisting of disgustingly crude 
  words, phrases and ideas. For someone who lectures others about logic and 
  fallacies, I find your use of language exhibits a shameless double standard. 
  It is the height of hypocrisy when you say: What matters to me is public 
  decency when speaking of someone in first person, and then use the most 
  indecent, tasteless, anti-social language I’ve ever come across.&quot;</i></font> 
  Don’t you think it is applicable for you now ?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  <p>DM:</b> Hmm. We're almost approaching the end. Tell us what're your future 
  plans.<br>
  <br>
  <b>SMI:</b> My future plan is to keep rolling over Mr. Avijit Roy, 
  irrespective of whether he decides to respond or not. Another plan is to meet 
  him oneday in a dead-alley, hold him by the collar, lean toward his face and 
  ask &quot;How, Avijit, how, is your forum Mukto-mona so successful, while mine 
  always looks like a barren field full of forwarded tiger-droppings. How come 
  Lopa joined in MM as a moderator entirely forgetting Aalaap? &quot; It's just 
  bleeping unfair. I hate myself. </p>
  <p><br>
  <b>DM:</b> That's ok, please don't be sad. Look around, may be you can try &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  thinking like a human being occasionally, if possible, if that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helps. 
  Alright then, that ends today's edition of our show. So &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long.<br>
