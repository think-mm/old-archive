<p class="MsoNormal">It is an untold story of an (Islami) agnostic who has 
already been appeared in cyberspace as the clamourer of holy humanity.&nbsp; For that 
last couple of months in all distinguished forums and newspapers (including NFB) 
and everywhere, people got n headache of listening his morbid outcry - &quot;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/1604">Islam 
vs. Humanity</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/1604">Koran 
is Bulshit</a>&quot; ! It seems he has memorized only one essay in his childhood and 
whatever unique masterpieces ( believe me...&nbsp; those are really unique) he writes 
now a day, all his roads eventually lead to Rome which reminds us one of the 
favourite childhood-stories of&nbsp; (in)famous &quot;Goru Rochonaa&quot; !&nbsp; What else we can 
expect from a holy scholastic pilgrim like him! Readers, guess whom I'm talking 
about ! Of course you guessed right - Ten thousand Thundering Typhoon of the 
Blistering Barnacles! He is none but our resident Vidyasager - Mr. Obsessive 
Compulsive Fault Finder (<b>OCFF</b>) - Moulana SMI (PhD). He is continuously 
showing his great talent&nbsp;of&nbsp;hitting the nail on the head regarding all 
freethinkers'&nbsp;identity. But fortunately, his intelligence-issue disallowed him 
to put two and two together. Let us remind our&nbsp;readers one more time <b><u>
<span style="color: red">which brand of humanity</span></u></b> does the famous 
pilgrim want to establish in our obscene society! Let’s quote some from some of 
his previous heavenly&nbsp; “droppings” that he has strewn all over the cyber world:&nbsp;
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Mr. Wa<i>heed</i>’s <b><u>heedless blunders</u></b> are 
  shown in red;…. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Hey, <b><u>apeMan</u></b>, you finally wrote something 
  that I may find to be partially palatable! </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Dear <b><u>apeMan</u></b>, why do you even bother with 
  &quot;I got it&quot; when, repeatedly I must add, you fail to GETIT…. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">In your <b><u>morbid inability</u></b> to interpret 
  plain English, you found the gist from the above comments to be that of 
  ‘rationalizing Islam’…very trippy, indeed, however unfathomably erroneous. <b>
  <u>ApeMan</u></b>, I’d be embarrassed if I were you, to expose my serious 
  interpretive limitations. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">If Pyro should exercise his right to freedom of speech, 
  and admits publicly that he may use marijuana, then who the heck are you, <b>
  <u>apeMan</u></b>, to suggest that he should not? </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I thought we’re proceeding with the observation of 
  hilarity of your <b><u>poking your growing Pinocchio’s nose</u></b> between 
  Eshon and Pyro…..</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Discerning readers ought to be vigilant against such <u>
  <b>braying donkeys</b></u>, especially so because they ( freethinkers) may 
  appear to look like humans.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here are some more noteworthy quotes from our&nbsp; SMI 
displaying his <b>propensity for bashing the freethinkers in the past</b>.&nbsp; Have 
we not seen an abundance of such highty-mighty, self-aggrandizing quotes from 
our resident Vidyasager, Moulana SMI?&nbsp; If you already forgot&nbsp;that nectar, here 
are some samplings again to refresh your memory:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; </p>
<ol start="1" type="1" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Mr. Ali Sina only within the scope of <b><u>his clearly 
  rudimentary and often erroneous knowledge</u></b> of the Bible. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">For instance, there was an <b><u>article in &quot;Hinduunity.org&quot;</u></b> 
  (FIGHTING FOR A HINDU RASTRA! JAI BHARAT MATA!) in which the author (Abul 
  Kasem ), using the initials of &quot;A.K.&quot; on an article titled, &quot;Breaking the 
  Manacles of Islam&quot;,…. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I clarified earlier that I am a 'Shotyo Shondhani', in 
  principle. And since I reached that personal illumination recently, I have 
  ceased the use of any pseudonyms that I might have used in the past, for I 
  concluded that in using such I might have violated my own principles…..Let me 
  ask you what 'Shatya' has it been that you are so desperately searching for 
  which justifies <b><u>your being 'O-Shatya'</u></b> about your identity, and 
  use ONLY that on the internet.. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">In the famous <span style="color: black">“<b>Siamese-Twin</b>”</span> 
  exchanges, here is what you said: “All the quotes you picked up, hey, were you 
  sitting there laying a bait, <b><u>Bishnu boy?</u></b> </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">I think for any of us it may not be a good idea to eat 
  'too many bananas.' That is one eating habit of our <b><u>'simian' ancestors</u></b> 
  that it may not be a good idea for any 'srimaan' to duplicate! [Screech, 
  screech, screech!!!] </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">A Serious <b><u>Case of Amnesia</u></b>??&nbsp; For insulting 
  Ms. Lopa tasneem, Shabnam Nadiya and Avijit Roy [post #4086 in eshomabesh]…</li>

<p>Now readers, I know I shouldn't be making fun of people, but then I'm&nbsp; no 
Gandhi, right? So, let's imagine Mr. Munir shaheb was the control officer in 
Johnson Space Station when Apollo 13 ran into trouble.</p>
<p><b>Apollo 13:</b> Houston, houston we've got a situation here.</p>
<p><b>SMI: </b>Apollo, your perennial predilection to perpetuate the 
intergalactic posers predispose you to the cyber pampers -- that is, out-of-luck 
-- which can be compared with early proboscidian caged in a prismoid.</p>
<p><b>Apollo 13:</b> Houston, it's not a prank we're relaying. Our oxygen tank 
in the command module has exploded.</p>
<p><b>SMI:</b> Apollo, do you think, just because the nasal index of the 
strawberry-rootbeer shake I am stowing away is a notch higher than expected 
makes me part of a narcokleptocracy? Occasionally I do get called a schlemiel 
for my baryonic fecundity to engender machine-finish doltishness, but, with my 
charbroiled musings of words, I can still flabbergast some reptant creatures - 
for example, the lacertilia lizard that habitates underneath my supercomputer.</p>
<p><b>Apollo 13: </b>Damn it. Are you outta 'r skull? We'r suspecting a hole in 
the lander. So, we're going to close the lander's hatch. Do you copy?</p>
<p><b>SMI: </b>Apollo, in objective reality there's no such thing called 'copy'? 
Just like Dr. Howling Fox uttered &quot;It's either your ballerina or not&quot;, I must 
echo: It's either your words or not. In other words, I am antipathetic to 
copying. I don't know if that leaves me with cul-de-sac but the whole sanctum of 
mind would proliferate tactical raptures if a disapprobation is allowed. And 
moreover it seems to be a fallacy of bifurcation !</p>
<p>Ok, you guess what would have happened to the space crews if he're really the 
person in command. </p>
<p>I will be highly obliged if someone takes charge to distribute his famous 
story in all cyber-forums.</p>
<p>S. A. Montu. </p>
