	Prof. Muzaffar Hosain of Biggan Chetana Parisad thanking Shiksa Andolan

	nothing should taken as accepted without questioning. That is the basis of 
	rationalism. Though in time scale ‘we are 400 yrs ahead of Bruno’s time the

	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Bruno was a 
	philosopher, a scientist and a great rationalist of medieval period having 
	no faith in any traditional religions. He flourished in during later part of 
	16<sup>th</sup> century. He was born in a village called Nola near to Naples 
	city in Italy in 1548. The time was synchronized with the publication of 
	Great Copernicus’ famous work on heliocentric model of our solar system 
	contained in the book entitled ‘<i>de Revolutionnus Orbium Celestum</i>’ 
	i.e. Revolution-Orbit of the Celestial Bodies that heralded the dawn of the 
	new astronomy. He grew as a Dominican orthodox in his early life and adopted 
	the name Giordano. His worldly name before he entered the Order of St. 
	Dominic. He continued his novitiate and education at Naples finally being 
	ordained as a priest in 1572. As a novitiate in the St. Dominic he not only 
	studied church doctrines and literature, but spent considerable time in 
	studying old Greek Philosophical works as well as works of contemporary 
	European thinkers with equal devotion. In here he first came </span>
	<font face="Verdana">in contact with unorthodox work of Copernicus, which 
	was to have such a profound impact on his life. Copernican Heliocentric 
	system of the then Universe not only challenged Church’s cosmological views, 
	but also the social order of hierarchy envisaged in feudalism. The earlier 
	perfect Ptolemaic Geocentric system of the Universe, with the Earth at the 
	center, reinforced the rigid of feudal order with serfs at the bottom and 
	the Pope at the pinnacle. The dangerous implication of the Copernican view 
	of the Universe was that if the Church’s credo of infallibility could be 
	challenged in the cosmological arena then its social position was also cast 
	into doubt. Bruno’s interest outside the Orthodox Church literature came to 
	the notice of the Church authorities, and since then he was kept under 
	strict surveillance of Dominic authority. His originality of views and 
	critical attitude on accepted theological doctrines invited unpleasant 
	notice of the authority. This created resentment against the authoritarian 
	view of the Church in him, and finally after 4 years of priesthood he left 
	the order in 1576. A formal accusation of heresy was brought against him. He 
	escaped to Rome. There he studied with deep devotion philosophical 
	literatures (forbidden) of various schools annotated by Erasmus, a famous 
	Dutch humanist philosopher. He remained outspoken critic of Church’s 
	orthodox views and mysteries of faith. This was brought to the notice of the 
	Church at Rome, and the accusations were renewed at the convent of the 
	Minerva. However before he was denounced to ecclesiastical authorities he 
	fled away from Rome roaming about in Italy for three years. He spent the 
	rest of his life until he was captured in Venice, an independent state 
	outside Roman domain, wandering Europe discussing and promoting his 
	philosophical ideas. He finally went to Geneva (1579), the city then 
	dominated by Calvin sect of Protestantism. It is rumored that he did 
	accepted the Calvinist faith, but soon being disillusioned started 
	criticizing the doctrine in Bruno’s characteristic style. He had also come 
	in conflict with academicians for their erroneous views and mistakes while 
	delivering lectures. This annoyed the Calvin himself who was known for his 
	intolerance and agony, which led him to leave the city. He then traveled to 
	Toulouse, Lyons in France, and ultimately to Paris in 1581. But again he 
	moved to England, and for a time at least enjoyed the favour of Queen 
	Elizabeth and the friendship of Sir Philip Sydney. To the latter he 
	dedicated one of his best book ‘II spacio della bestia trionfante’ (The 
	Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast), a most bitter and critical treatise 
	against the doctrines of the Catholic Church, published in 1584. As he was 
	denied to lecturing in Oxford University, he published another famous book 
	‘Cena delle ceneri’ (Ash Wednesday Supper), criticizing the Oxford 
	professors’ narrow knowledge of Philosophy, saying that they knew more about 
	beer than about Greek. He once again returned to Paris in 1585 but only to 
	move to Germany (1587), wither he showed similar attitude to local 
	academicians as to Oxford professors. In Helmstadt, he was excommunicated by 
	the Lutherans. He spent some time in literary activity at Frankfort before 
	he returned to finally Venice in 1591 at the invitation of Zunus Mocenigo, 
	who wished to learn Bruno’s famous system of memory training. But it was 
	only a trap, as his disciple denounced him to the Venetian inquisition.</font></p>

	arrested on May 13 1592, and his trial before the Venetian inquisitors first 
	took refuge in the principle of ‘two-fold truth’, saying that the errors 
	imputed to him were held by him ‘as a philosopher, and not as an honest 
	Christian’; later however he solemnly abjured all his errors and doubts in 
	the matter of Catholic doctrine and practice. At this stage the Roman 
	inquisition intervened and asked the Venetian inquisition hid extradition, 
	which was obliged after some hesitation. This was in February 1593. </font>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Bruno 
	was kept in prison for seven years, for what reason, the historians tried in 
	vain to unearth the reason of long detention without trial. It was however

	on all aspects of his life and his philosophical views. In the spring of 
	1599, at last the trial was begun before a commission of the Inquisition. 
	The Inquisition formally brought as many as eight specific charges of 
	heresy. But the church till today has not revealed those acts of heresy 
	committed by Bruno. However according to limited and indirect records 
	available Bruno was indicted for his ‘atheistic’ views and for the 
	publication of the ‘Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast’. He refused to 
	recant. After the accused had been granted several terms of respite in which 
	to retract his errors, he was finally condemned in January 1600. He was 
	handed over to the secular power on 8<sup>th</sup> February 1600 for 
	punishment befitting to his crime of heresy. Many opines that he was not 
	condemned for his defence of Copernican theory, nor for his doctrine of the 
	plurality of inhabited worlds, but for his theological ‘errors’, among which 
	were the following : that Christ was not God but merely an unusually skilful 
	magician, that the Holy Ghost is the soul of the world, that the Devil will

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Despite the false note of concern about Bruno’s physical well being, the 
	Inquisition’s verdict was a death sentence. Thus more than 400 years ago, 
	the Catholic Church executed Giordano Bruno, Italian Philosopher and 
	scientist, for crime of heresy. After the verdict was pronounced, he was 
	taken from his cell in the early hours of the morning of February 16, 1600 
	to the Piazza dei Fiori in Rome and burnt alive at the stake. To the last, 
	the Inquisitors were afraid of the preaching of Bruno who was known 
	throughout Europe as a bold speaker and a brilliant unusual thinker. In a 
	peculiar twist to the gruesome affair, the executioners were ordered to tie 
	his tongue so that he would be unable to address those gathered. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Unlike 
	Bruno, Copernicus was a cool headed person. He knew his theory of 
	heliocentric system of Universe would not be accepted to the public of the 
	Unenlightened Europe, unless he could convince the Church. He therefore 
	undertook to carry the gist of his work <i>De Revolutionibus Orbium 
	Coelestum Libri</i> to different churches of Europe including that of Rome 
	to convince them that the Earth was not the center of the universe, but a 
	mere planet like others revolving around the Sun, the center of the solar 
	system. Though Copernicus formulated his theory thirty years earlier- he did 
	not dare to publish until the year of his death, 1543. Needless to say the 
	Church authority was not convinced. Even a century later, a very old, tired 
	and physically tortured Galileo, understandably afraid of the torture that 
	awaited him unless he knuckled under, recanted his blasphemous confirmation 
	of Copernican system of the universe. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Between Copernicus and Galileo in time, we find the most fascinating 
	character of Giordano Bruno from Nola. Unlike Copernicus, Bruno did not 
	believe in soft-pedaling what he believed to be the truth. He was 
	flamboyant, vain and loud. Denouncing his earlier faith, he set off around 
	Europe as a wandering teacher of philosophy. And unlike Galileo, he not did 
	not fear torture and death, but his last words on the subject- literally his 
	last words on the subject, (pointing to his panel of judges) were defiant : 
	“<span style="color:maroon">Perhaps you who pronounce my sentence are in

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	Holy Church and its tormenting institution the Inquisition will be 
	remembered as symbol of arch-reaction. But Bruno has withstood the test of 
	time. In him we discover a true Renaissance man with a passionate love for 
	all aspects of human learning. He courageously participated with great 
	energy in the intellectual turbulence of his time. His insights made an 
	important contribution to the ideas that laid the basis for modern science. 
	His stubborn refusal to bow to the authority, power and repressive 
	methodology of the Catholic Church, the most powerful institution of his 
	day, will no doubt continue to inspire us for centuries to come.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
	Bruno was the forerunner of what we call today rationalism. To him reason 
	and logic form the basis for determining truth, not the religious dogma.</b> 
	His rationalism finds expression in one of his latest book ‘De Triplici 
	Minimo’ (1591): “He who desires to philosophise must first of all doubts all 
	things. He must not assume a position in a debate before he has listened to 
	the various opinions, and considered and compared the reasons for and 
	against. He must never judge or take up a position on the evidence of what 
	he has heard, on the opinion of the majority, the age, merits, or prestige 
	of the speaker concerned, but he must proceed according to the persuasion of 
	an organic doctrine, which adheres to real things. And to a truth that can 
	be understood by the light of reason.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">In his 
	writings Bruno had expounded a system of philosophy in which the principal 
	elements could be identified as ‘neo-Platonism’, materialistic monism, 
	rational mysticism, and the naturalistic concept of the unity of the 
	material world. It is said that from the influence of neo Platonism he 
	derived his concept of monism. On the other hand from pre-Socratic 
	philosophical influence he formulated the materialistic interpretation of 
	the One. And from the Copernican principle he had learned to identify the 
	material One with the visible, infinite, heliocentric universe.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">His 
	attitude towards Aristotle may be illustrated by his reiterated assertion 
	that the natural philosophy of the Stagirite is vitiated by the predominance 
	of the dialectical over the mathematical mode of conceiving natural 
	phenomena. He wanted to reform Aristotelian philosophy, but not in the way 
	his contemporaries, Ramus and Patrizzi proposed to do. His feeling towards 
	Scholastic school of philosophy was one of deep contempt if not hatred. He 
	had however a high degree of regards for Albert the Great and St. Thomas.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">We may 
	summarise his system of thought calling it as materialistic pantheism, to 
	some it may look incoherent- not surprising in the context of medieval 
	thought. To Bruno- God and the world are one; matter and spirit, body and 
	soul are two phases of the same substance; the universe is infinite; beyond 
	the visible world there is an infinity of other worlds, each of which is 
	inhabited; this terrestrial globe has a soul; in fact each and every part of 
	it, mineral as well as plant and animal, is animated; all matter is made of 
	the same elements (<u>no distinction between terrestrial and celestial 
	matter</u>); all souls are akin. No doubt the attempt to grand unification – 
	a scientific continuity among all the phenomena of nature is an important 
	manifestation of the modern spirit, and interesting in a time when Bruno was 
	alive. We can appreciate how Bruno’s attempt to establish a unitary concept 
	of nature commanded the admiration of such men as Spinoza, Jacobi, and 
	Hegel. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Roman 
	Catholic Church condemned him as heretic, and the Protestant divine termed 
	him as “a man of great capacity, with infinite knowledge, but not a trace of 
	religion.”</font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bruno’s 
	cosmological outlines have found expression in his three famous book namely, 
	The Ash Wednesday Supper, ‘Cause, Principle and Unity’, and ‘On the Infinite 
	Universe and Worlds’, which together present a brilliant anticipation of 
	subsequent scientific and philosophical developments. In some respects, 
	particularly in the concept of unlimited universe, and other worlds, his 
	conclusions boldly arrived at by mere intuition surpassed the work of his 
	successors such as Galileo and Kepler. In Ash Wednesday Super he was the 
	first to argue with firm conviction and reason that universe is infinitely 
	large- containing an infinite number of words similar to the earth, and not 
	limited by a fixed starry sphere, as conceived by Copernicus, Galileo or 
	even Kepler. He argued that even Sun was not the center of the universe, as 
	if the sun were observed from any stars it would look no different from 
	them. Harriot, a noted mathematician of medieval period, a great proponent 
	of Bruno’s infinite universe once wrote to Kepler in 1608 discussing Bruno’s 
	concept of infinite universe, who outright rejected the idea. Bruno was well 
	ahead of his time. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Giordano Bruno 
	was neither Copernicus nor Galileo in the scientific sense. His vision of 
	universe was, however, not based on any scientific observations like 
	puzzling over retrograde motion of planets in their orbits, nor on the 
	telescopic observations of celestial bodies as did Galileo, but his method 
	was more of intuitive based on already known scientific facts, and of a 
	philosophical, aesthetic stance. His idea of relative ness and absoluteness 
	in the universe view may be understood from his own utterance (<i>Cause, 
	Principle and Unity</i>): </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">This entire globe, this star, not being subject to 
	death, and dissolution and annihilation being impossible anywhere in Nature, 
	from time to time renews itself by charging and altering all parts. There is 
	no absolute up or down, as Aristotle taught; no absolute position in space; 
	but the position of a body is relative to that of other bodies. Everywhere 
	there is incessant relative to change in position throughout the universe, 
	and the observer is always at the center of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
