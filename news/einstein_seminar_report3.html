	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	The paper began with a quotation from Einstein’s letter from Berlin to 
	Arnold Summerfield in Munich on 28<sup>th</sup> November, 1915 where in 
	Einstein narrated during this month he had passed through most difficult and 
	critical time of his life. He was then pretty busy developing his equations 
	gravitational theory- and searching for their real basis.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	He published his paper dealing with what now known as ‘General Relativity’ 
	in Annalen der Physik in 1905 (Ser 4, <b>17</b>, 769 – 822) under the title 
	‘Grundalge der allgemeinen Relativistatstheorie’. After reading the paper 
	Max Born was simply charmed stating as human mind’s greatest output in 
	understanding nature of physical world – a unique combination of philosophic 
	sharpness, intuition, and mathematical efficiency. It is an art painted by a 
	great artist. He worked for over a decade to arrive at the ultimate result. 
	His thought began with the idea what was relation between inertial mass and 
	gravitational mass, both concepts were introduced by Newton. In 1911 he 
	showed that both are equivalent. By 1912 he was convinced that Minskowski’s 
	4 dimensional flat geometry, an extension of Euclidean geometry must break 
	down yielding place to a four dimensional curved space. In order to reach 
	such a decision he had to learn absolute differential tensor calculus with 
	the help of his friend Grossman, mathematics of Gregorio Rickky and Levi 
	Chevita. Once the Minkoski space was reduced to curved space Einstein 
	proposed that Gravitation is nothing but expression of curvature of the 
	space concerned. </p>

	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	In the next year he wrote another paper under the title ‘Kosmologische 
	Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativistatstheorie’ (<i>Preuessische 
	Akademie der Wissenschaften, Sitzungsberichte,</i> pt I, 142-152, 1917) in 
	which took the first step of understanding cosmology of the universe.</p>

	<h2><span style="color:#993300">Principle of Equivalence&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	In general one distinguishes between weak and strong equivalence. 
	Equivalence between Inertial mass and the gravitational mass is the weak 
	principle of equivalence. Einstein showed these two masses must be 
	identical. Later on it was experimentally verified. According Newtonian 
	mechanics when a mass small is being attracted by a big mass M the 
	acceleration experienced by the small mass is simply g = GM/r<sup>2</sup>, G 
	is the gravitational Constant and r is the distance between the particles. 
	Thus principle of equivalence became a fundamental principle, which states: 
	‘Gravitational mass and inertial mass from the point of physical view are 
	totally equivalent in nature – no physical experiment can distinguish them.’ 
	This in simple term means when a particle is found to moving with 
	accelerated motion it is impossible to if the acceleration arises from 
	inertial or gravitational. The consequence of the principle of equivalence 
	is then that any constant gravitational field could be made to vanish by 
	choosing a suitable accelerated frame of reference. In the language of 
	mathematics the gravitational filed could be ‘transformed away’. As it is 
	interesting from general point of view let us explain it a little bit with 
	the help of an example of moving lift. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	<u>1<sup>st</sup> Stage</u>: Let us assume that a lift has been taken to an 
	isolated position in space. A uniform motion is set in to the lift. The 
	observer inside the lift attached to moving frame would see all objects out 
	the lift were moving uniformly. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	<u>2<sup>nd</sup> Stage</u>: The lift is now placed under a gravitational 
	field, say at a distance above the surface of the earth. Now let go under 
	free fall. As according to equivalence principle gravitational acceleration 
	is same for all objects, the observer in the lift will not see other 
	situation different from 1. This is means it is not possible to detect 
	gravitational acceleration sitting from a frame of reference that itself 
	falling freely falling under the same gravitational field. The man will feel 
	weightlessness which means either he is rest or in uniform motion. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	<u>3<sup>rd</sup> Stage</u>: The lift is the again taken to a distance space 
	away from any gravitational field. The lift is set to a uniform accelerated 
	motion <i>a</i> by an attached rocket. It will appear to the observer in the 
	lift all objects out side the lift are moving with accelerated motion a but 
	opposite direction and same for all objects.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	<u>4<sup>th</sup> Stage</u>: We now take the lift to a gravitational field 
	such that g = a (of previous experiment). The observer will not see any 
	different situation as compared to stage 3.</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	Only limitation we have to think of is the effect is highly localized i.e. 
	only in a local position in cases 1 and 2, and in cases 3 and 4 equivalence 
	of inertial and gravitational are appreciated. Einstein made this principle 
	universal and applicable to wider range of space. This is what is now termed 
	as ‘strong equivalence principle’. </p>

	<h1>Equation of motion of a free particle</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	What Einstein then did he developed a generalized equation of motion of a 
	free particle in a Riemannian curved space in stead Minkoski’s flat space 
	which include a non zero Christofel Tensor, whereas in Minkoski space its 
	components are zero. This is the famous equation of geodesic representing 
	the locus of a freely moving particle in space. This tensor is found to 
	contain a term arising from the inertial acceleration of the particle 
	because of use of non inertial frame and other term from gravitational 
	acceleration. Thus according to principle of equivalence, gravitational term 
	can be expressed as component of Christofel Tensor, which is a sum of 
	acceleration due to inertial and gravitational. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	As all over Minkoski space the Christofel Tensor is found to be zero hence, 
	in presence of gravitation field the four-dimensional space could not be 
	flat i.e. the space is curved- which is described as Riemannian curvature. 
	This concept is expressed in general theory of relativity as ‘gravitational 
	field reduces to geometric curvature. This is what is called geometrical 
	transformation of gravity. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	Thus there is no inertial frame in general relativity only non inertial 
	frame exists, which means there is no significance of absolute acceleration 
	as absolute velocity has no significance in inertial frame. This is why it 
	is called general relativity. In Riemannian curved space, the Christofel 
	Tensor of a curvature could be made zero by a general transformation-&nbsp; a 
	situation of weightless ness, which we experience in a free fall lift, or 
	space travelers in a rotation free satellite. The astronaut who is attached 
	to a rotating commoving frame of reference would not feel either inertial or 
	gravitational acceleration. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
	From this follows, showed Einstein, that if a light passes near a uniformly 
	moving lift, the observer in the lift would see that light passes in a 
	straight line unaffected. However if the lift were moving with accelerated 
	motion, say upward, to the observer the light beam appeared to bent away 
	downward. Because with respect to accelerated from attached to the lift 
	bodies outside experiencing inertial acceleration down ward causing a down 
	word bending of beam of light. The effect may be seen from another point of 
	view. As we know we can associate an inertial mass m<sub>p</sub> of a photon 
	of energy E = h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span> = mc<sup>2</sup>, 
	mp = E/c<sup>2</sup> = h <span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span>/ c<sup>2</sup>, 
	from the equivalence principle this mass is also a gravitational mass of the 
	photon. Hence light ought to be subject of gravitational attraction by 
	another gravitational mass. For example light rays that passes near the sun 
	must be deflected toward the sun by its gravitational field, just as the 
	path of a planet is deflected. </p>

	Einstein then, says the paper, set up field equations valid for material

	will retain their same form in all frames. The general form of field

	From general theory of relativity it was predicted the phenomenon of ‘Red 
	Shift’, a relativistic Doppler effect which was verified experimentally by 
	observing galaxies moving away from us appearing as reddish. The theory also 
	successfully explained the observation in advancement of the perihelion of 
	the planet Mercury. Finally prediction of bending of light in a strong 
	gravitational field given by 4M/R, where M is the source of gravitational 
	field, say mass of the sun, and R is the radius of the Sun. If we put the 
	value of R and M for Sun, the deflection of a light beam is ~ 1”.75 (see.).

	The general theory also predicted the possible formation of large heavy mass 
	concentrated in small locality whose gravitational attraction could reach 
	such an extent that all materials objects including light once get into it 
	would not be able to escape. Such object is now termed as `Black Hole’, more 
	extensively explained by Hawking, Penrose, Chandrashekhar and many others.&nbsp; 
	Professor Rashid completed his paper with brief introduction of cosmology of 
	our universe and tried to show how it was hidden in the general theory of 
	relativity. Our universe is made of innumerable number of galaxies and 
	nebulas distributed all over the universe more or less uniformly. When 
	Einstein wrote is paper it was thought the universe is made of stars and the 
	mass of the universe is uniformly distributed. The universe would look alike 
	from all directions. This is what he called ‘Cosmic Principle’. So we can 
	define a cosmic time too and attributes of the universe can be expressed as 
	function of this time and only this time. The density, temperature, 
	curvature of the space and its metric all will be function of this time and 
	same all over the universe. In Einstein’s world the main feature of it is 
	its isotropic nature. The mathematical analysis based on such fundamental 
	attributes to universe leads to the expanding universe under some 
	conditions. Experiment of Hubble on distance galaxies confirmed that 
	universe is expanding. Gammow suggested that if universe were expanding, 
	then these moving galaxies i.e. entire materials contents must have been 
	concentrated at a singular point at certain time, which must had exploded 
	violently at the time of creation of the universe. The phenomenon is now 
	called big bang. If such phenomenon truly occurred then its radiation 
	background must have survived right now. This was precisely experimentally 
	observed. </p>

	Finally the author mentioned about Einstein’s dream of unified field theory, 
	though he did not succeed in transforming Maxwell’s electromagnetic field in 
	to space-time curvature, as was done for Newtonian gravitational field. 
	Though not in Einstein’s way unification of three fields namely 
	electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong nuclear have been unified in Grand 
	Unified Theory (GUT). Only illusive gravitational field discovered by Newton 
	is still left out. Would String theory succeed, only time can say?&nbsp; </p>

	As Professor Islam was away, the chairman of the session Prof. Roy presented 
	his paper in brief on his behalf. The salient feature of his paper was that 
	the Universe is mainly made of galaxies and dust particles distributed 
	uniformly over the universe. The galaxies of various sizes and shapes are 
	really made of starts living in different stages. Some are white dwarfs, 
	some are black dwarfs, some are neutron stars and illusive black holes. Name 
	of our galaxy is Milky Way in which our sun is just another star out of 
	millions. In time our sun will turn into a white dwarf and then a black 
	dwarf after giving up radiation. Famous astrophysicist Chandra Shekhar 
	theoretically showed that the stars having mass greater than 1.4 times the 
	mass of sun will not turn into a white dwarf. As the mass of a star 
	increases to the critical value its radius reaches to zero. This is what we 
	call Chandra Shekhar limit. Later works showed massive stars lying within 
	mass limit (1.4 – 3) M, M being the mass of the sun, may become neutron 
	starts after being blown up through violent explosion called Supernova. The 
	still massive stars become ‘Black holes’ because of collapse on a small 
	volume due to severe gravitational pull. The characteristic of these 
	invisible celestial bodies are-&nbsp; any objects including electromagnetic 
	radiations when pass near by fall into it and nothing could come out of the 
	body, except a kind of radiation called Hawking radiation, once absorbed. In 
	1929 because of a series of celebrated experiments performed on distance 
	galaxies by Edwin Hubble, which showed appearance of those galaxies as 
	reddish. Conclusion was these galaxies must be moving away from our galaxy, 
	the Milky Way, appearing red because of Doppler shift as predicted by 
	Einstein’s General Relativity. From this idea of expanding universe led 
	scientists to think and calculate back that about 15000 millions of years 
	ago all these materials must have been concentrated in the form dense energy 
	(hot super dense state) into a singular point, which suddenly exploded into 
	a ‘big bang’- the moment of creation of space-time. Physicists opined that 
	even up to 10<sup>-40</sup> sec. all four fundamental forces were unified in 
	the form of a ‘super force’. Elementary particles like quarks, electrons, 
	protons and neutrons came into being after ~ 1 sec. and then after a few 
	seconds a nucleus consisting of a proton and a neutron was formed, and then 
	gradually Hydrogen and Helium, the first simple atomic system came into 
	existence. And after about hundred thousand years matter was formed, and 
	then after a period two hundred million years galaxies and other big 
	celestial bodies were formed. Our sun was created inside our own galaxy 
	milky way about 500 crore years ago, and then about 450 crores of years back 
	our solar system including mother earth was born. What was before the big 
	bang is a metaphysical question which physicists bother least to answer?&nbsp;

	expanding – the distance galaxies are moving away faster than the nearer 
	ones. The value of the Hubble constant i.e. present rate of expansion of the

	it will start contracting after some time depends on many elements. The 
	major element is the average density of the matter in the universe. It has

	physicists are of opinion that other than visible matters there are dark 
	matters more or less uniformly distributed in the universe, which may be 
	undetected black holes, intergalactic sea of hydrogen and neutrino-ocean. If

	reach a singularity point similar to that of at the time of creation 
	collapsing into a big crunch, the end of universe. There is another 
	possibility however, instead of collapsing into a big crunch, it may bounce 
	back overcoming the gravitational attraction because of tremendous opposite 
	pressure generated during the process of contraction. In this way we might 
	get an oscillating universe, which will never die away.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
