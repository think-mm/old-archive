	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a pioneering Internet based forum 
	for members of the South Asian community who were interested in freethought, 
	rationalism, matters of religion and secularism and human rights, Mukto-Mona 
	started with the intention of debating issues critical to this region in the 
	year 2000. It has been no small measure of support from our members that has 
	helped Mukto-Mona go far beyond its Internet-based existence into society in 
	Bangladesh to get our hands dirty working in the field. In addition to 
	getting involved in Bangladesh, we have also been working closely with 
	different International Humanist organizations around the world. Our 
	advisory committee member Alan Levin declared in the Atheist Alliance 
	International Convention in Los Angeles in January 2005 that Mukto-Mona had 
	become the fourth most visited secular website on the Internet thanks to 
	your active participation here. With your continued support, we would like 
	to move further ahead. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh is arguably one of the 
	poorest countries in South Asia and with problems of poverty, growing 
	religious fundamentalism, flawed system of education, healthcare and the 
	very poor status of women. We decided to contribute in creating awareness in 
	Bangladeshi society through different measures. MM's 1<sup>st</sup> project, 
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/flood2004/roumari.html">reconstruction of a primary school in remote Roumari</a> area in Bangladesh, 
	turned out to be much bigger than just a flood rehabilitation program. After 
	rebuilding their school building, we have promised to help them to establish 
	their school for few more years with the commitment that they would promote 
	a secular curriculum to the students. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our collaboration with the Shikkha 
	Andolon Moncho to promote field work in Bangladesh has manifested itself in 
	publicizing scientific and secular awareness by celebrating Einstein's 
	centenary, <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/news/seminar_bruno290405.html">awareness of Bruno's martyrdom</a>, and seminars and reviews of 
	secular books among several projects. Year long seminars and activities to 
	propagate secular thought are in progress along with the Moncho. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first publication of Alo Hate 
	Adharer Jatri written by MM's founding moderator, Avijit Roy, a book in 
	Bangla on the origins of the universe, which has been extremely well 
	received among general readers and the intellectual community of Bangladesh. 
	Renowned Bangladeshi intellectuals and scientists, such as, Dr. Kabir 
	Chowdhury, Dr. Anisuzzaman, Dr. Harun Ar Rashid, Dr. Hironmoy Sen Gupta and 
	Dr. Ajoy Roy were among those who attended the book release [<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/alo_hate/book/prokashona_utshob_held.html">Prokashona 
	Utshab</a>]. The book is in 
	its second reprint in a few months. This was the first publication effort 
	from MM and it has been a great success story for all of us. We also have an 
	understanding with the publisher, one of the most respected in Bangladesh, 
	that we would supply more books on secular and scientific topics. There has 
	also been considerable interaction with the media in Bangladesh with several 
	newspapers and weekly magazines regularly publishing articles sent through 
	Mukto-Mona. The prize in this area has been the permission given to 
	Mukto-Mona to translate articles by scientists like Dr. Mark Perakh, Dr. Tim 
	Berra and Dr. Victor Stenger into Bangla and publish them on our website. We 
	also work closely with several Secular, Humanist and Scientific forums like, 
	<i>Talk Reason</i>, etc, which promote cutting edge discoveries and awareness 
	discussed by well known scientists in their area. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our advisory committee member Dr. 
	Ajoy Roy has been actively protesting all kinds of minority and human rights 
	violations through national and International platforms including MM. There 
	have been noteworthy acknowledgements of Mukto Mona's achievements - Prof 
	Ajoy Roy participated along with journalist Shahriar Kabir in a discussion 
	on fundamentalism in the British Parliament on invitation. We worked on 
	several other projects last year including supporting the 
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/humayun_azad/memorial.html">Humayun Azad 
	Foundation</a> and 
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/shahriar/fund.html">helping secular journalists</a> with medical treatment. And in a 
	very different sense, Mukto-Mona was &quot;acknowledged&quot; by the government of the
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/mm_banned_uae.html">UAE which decided to ban the organization and block it's website</a>. We are 
	unaware if any discussion group has been banned by a fundamentalist 
	government anywhere in the world. Being banned by such government, is, to 
	every one of us, a badge of honor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In all of our efforts, we have been 
	supported actively by secular organizations around the world. We would have 
	to acknowledge the Atheist Alliance International, the largest umbrella body 
	of humanist and secular organizations in the world, the Center for Inquiry, 
	an organization with a towering presence in the world of reason, the 
	Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations with whom we have the same 
	arrangement over publications that we have with the scientists whose names 
	we mentioned above and the Indian Rationalist Association. The International 
	Humanist and Ethical Union has also provided continuous encouragement and 
	support from its side. Among individual writers we have a list of authors 
	that is long and highly respectable but Prabir Ghosh and his organization 
	<a href="http://www.srai.org/">SRAI</a> merit a special mention for their association with Mukto Mona which has 
	always been supportive and encouraging. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the future, we plan on starting 
	our own publishing house and are always open to ideas and suggestions from 
	you, our members. If Mukto-Mona has become the fourth most visited secular 
	website on the Internet, it is only due to your active participation here. 
	We would like to have your views on what should be done both by way of focus 
	areas in articles etc. as well as in fieldwork. And we hope to continue 
	receiving your encouragement and support in the years ahead. Thank you for 
	making this effort a success. </font></p>
