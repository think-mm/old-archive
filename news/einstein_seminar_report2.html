	Einstein’s World of Physics (9-30 to)</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>&nbsp;Chaired by: Professor 
	Ajoy Roy</b>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In all five papers were 
	presented as reported earlier. &nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>First paper: ‘<i>Einstein’s 
	dynamical theory of Brownian Motion</i>’ presented by Dr, Showkat Akbar of 
	AEC, Bangladesh. &nbsp;</b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Summary: Brownian motion 
		was discovered first by a British scientist in 1827, when he was looking 
		at a glass of water with suspended pollen grains. He found that pollens 
		were as if full of life moving in random manner in all directions inside 
		the liquid medium, water. This motion of non-soluble material particles 
		mixed in a liquid was known as ‘Brownian Motion’. The problem was not 
		understood and left unattended till Einstein looked to the problem very 
		seriously in 1905, no 2 of his three celebrated papers in Annal der 
		Physik in 1905. In earlier, some studies tried to explain it as a 
		phenomenon of surface tension of the liquid concerned, others attributed 
		it such properties of the liquid as viscosity, uneven temperature 
		distribution within the liquid, chemical reaction etc. But all attempts 
		failed. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Einstein considered 
	particles of very minute size only visible under a moderately high power 
	microscope i.e. of 10-2 to 10-3 cm or so immersed in a chemically inert 
	liquid. Einstein’s explanation is based on two assumptions: &nbsp;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
		<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The liquid 
			consists of innumerable number of its molecules (water molecule) of 
			medium, which are at random motion in a thermodynamical equilibrium 
			state due to thermal agitation.</li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">These molecules 
			randomly in motion at certain instant of time collide with the 
			pollen grains or any other non-soluble dust-particles suspended in 
			the liquid. These collisions between water molecules and pollen 
			grains create the random motion found in pollen grains.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Next problem is to apply 
	statistical method to understand the collision problem, which he did. 
	Obviously number of molecules far exceeds number of pollens, so we may 
	consider each pollen grain is surrounded but a large number of water 
	molecules. As the water molecules are in random motion the impact on a 
	pollen is not same as a result of which a non zero resultant force all the 
	time acts on a particular grain causing a motion in any direction. This 
	effect on each pollen gives an over all random motion picture. If the 
	particle size is big enough then impact on the grain from all other sides by 
	molecules tend to cancel each other – so non equilibrium force exists. This 
	diminishes the random motion. In analyzing this intricate problem Einstein 
	brought in </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">

			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The concept of 
			osmotic pressure in a liquid and phenomenon of diffusion instead of

			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Molecular kinetic 
			theory of heat and macroscopic theory of dissipation. </li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">He finally from his analysis 
	predicted the magnitude of size of a molecule. Thus Einstein theoretically 
	predicted the existence of the entity of molecule, very much a physical 
	reality rather than metaphysical concept confined so far in the mind of 
	philosophers.&nbsp; French physicist named Jean Perrin, after about a decade made 
	a detail study of suspended particles experimentally from which he estimated 
	the size of a molecule. This study under the name of ‘discovery of the 
	equilibrium of sedimentation’ brought him Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Einstein-Perrin effect not 
	only stimulated research works in various modern fields of physics such as 
	Fractal theory, voltage fluctuation for quantum effects which led to the 
	discovery of Quantum fluctuation dissipation theorem due to Callen &amp; Welton 
	and Nyquist &amp; Johonson, Statistical non linear dynamics, Thermal equilibrium 
	system etc.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In technological and applied 
	sciences, this phenomenon has been applied successfully: </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp; paper: ‘<i>Photo Electric Phenomenon</i>’ 
	presented by Prof. H. M. Sengupta, Professor of Physics (retd.), DU&nbsp;</b></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText">The phenomenon of Photo electricity shows that when a 
	beam of light falls on a metallic surface a stream of electrons escape from 
	the metal surface. According to classical theory of electromagnetic there is 
	nothing strange in it. When light falls on metal surface it absorbs light 
	energy and as energy is built up the electrons get out of the surface 
	overcoming the surface barrier characteristic of the material. But this 
	explanation offered by classical theory does tally with experimental facts. 
	As for example:&nbsp;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
		<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">For emission of 
			electron one needs a light of minimum wave length ( ), called 
			threshold frequency. Below threshold frequency no emission of 
			electrons takes whatever might be the Intensity of incident light. 
			</li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The peak of 
			kinetic energy of electrons is independent of intensity of light but 
			depends on frequency of light (above threshold frequency). The 
			maximum peak value linearly increases with the increase of frequency 
			of light. </li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The distribution 
			of energy of photoelectrons is again independent of intensity of 
			light used, but once again depend on the frequency of light used. 
			The intensity only increases the number of photoelectrons. </li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">According to 
			classical theory there must be some time lag between the fall light 
			on the surface and emission of electrons, but experiment shows that 
			the process is almost instantaneous. </li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">None of the above 
	characteristics associated with photoelectric effect could be explained with 
	electromagnetic theory of light. Einstein first in his famous paper 
	published in Annalen der Physik, ( ser 4), <b>17</b>,132-148, 1905 gave a 
	satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon. Instead of treating light as 
	wave of periodic vibration of electric and magnetic vectors, he used light 
	as a stream of concentrated energy-particles called quanta, each having 
	energy E = h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span> in his analysis. But 
	first he established the fact that light is in reality made of quanta i.e. 
	photons he tackled the problem of radiation inside a black body using 
	thermodynamical as well statistical methods. He used Boltzman’s fundamental 
	law connecting entropy of the system and the thermodynamic probability. 
	Einstein used Wien law to obtained for the probability of finding total 
	energy by chance compressed in a fraction of volume of the total volume. 
	This leads that the quantum character of light. He applied this concept to 
	explain the photoelectric effect. He treated the phenomenon as collision of 
	photons and bound electrons in a metal. Since an electron is bound up with 
	the metal surface, to liberate it a photon of minimum energy equal to that 
	barrier is required. So if we use a photon of energy (h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span>) 
	greater than barrier energy, some portion of energy of the photon would 
	spent to overcome the barrier (h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span><sub>o</sub>) 
	and rest energy would appear as kinetic energy of the escaping electron. The 
	simple interaction&nbsp; may be expressed as in equation form, known as 
	Einstein’s photoelectric equation.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span> 
	=&nbsp;&nbsp; h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span><sub>o</sub> + T<sub>m</sub></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The emitted electrons do not 
	have same kinetic energy because the electrons within metal escapes from 
	deep inside the metal, not only from the surface. Deeper electrons would 
	have lesser kinetic energy as photon would more energy to get them 
	liberated. In fact distribution of kinetic energy ranges from zero to a 
	maximum value (T<sub>m </sub>). &nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It may be stressed that 
	Einstein’s theory of photon is more fundamental in as sense light not only 
	absorbed or emitted as quantum of energy, but they travel too as particles 
	in all medium. On the other hand Planck was very conscious of his statement- 
	he thought light maintains its continuous character of flow of energy in the 
	form of Electromagnetic wave. Only during emission or absorption by an 
	atomic system it behaves as quantum of energy i.e. as particles. According 
	to Einstein’s principle intensity of light is the measure of number of 
	photons falling on a unit area per second time, whereas its energy is 
	associated with the corresponding frequency of light in question E = h<span style="font-family: Symbol">n</span>; 
	energy of photon thus does not depend on its intensity- this is the 
	fundamentality of Einstein’s concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	presented by Prof. Ahmed Shafi, Professor of Physics, DU</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Briefly introducing the 
	contradiction that existed between classical dynamics formulated by Newton 
	(1687) and Electromagnetic field Equations introduced by Karl Maxwell 
	(1888), which unified electricity, magnetism and light in one fold through 
	his celebrated four field equations. The scientists at that time that the 
	similar existence of time and space in those equations. But no further 
	progress was made, even theoretically to unify the concept of time and 
	space. On the other hand Newton’s concept about these two entities were that 
	both were independent of each other and absolute. Newton himself however 
	shown that absolute space and time could not be measured, we have to deal 
	with relative space and relative time. The scientists at that time 
	introduced a novel idea of a medium called ether through which Maxwell’s 
	electromagnetic waves propagate. It seems search for an absolute frame of 
	reference ended because this ether spreading over the entire universe 
	through which from microscopic particles to giant celestial bodies were 
	moving. Question arose are the Maxwell’s equations too invariant under 
	Galilean-Newtonian transformation. Mechanical laws were, but Maxwell’s 
	equations were not found to be. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Under this backdrop, after 
	industrial revolutions when sophisticate scientific instruments such various 
	kinds high resolution microscopes, optical interference instruments were 
	fabricated to observe minute optical phenomenon of microscopic world and 
	giant telescopes to see the Macroscopic world of universe. Michelson and 
	Morley performed a historical experiment to detect ether current both in the 
	direction in which earth was moving (in fact opposite to earth’s motion) in 
	the space around sun as well as perpendicular to the direction of motion. He 
	used a big interferometer with special arrangement based on the principle of 
	Michelson Interferrometer. Their attempt failed because in both directions 
	time of arrival of reflected light from the distance perpendicular mirrors 
	showed no difference, as it should have been from a simple calculation. It 
	was a perplex, which meant light travels with similar speed in all 
	directions whether along ether current or perpendicular to it. Classical 
	concept of relative motion so far light was concerned was not applicable. 
	This indirectly meant that we have to abandon the existence of ether. This 
	paved the new thought in the form Special theory of relativity invented by 
	Einstein, which he published in 1905 (Annalen der Physik, (ser 4), 17, 
	891-921, 1905). However Lorentz tried to explain the null result of 
	Michelson on the basis of contraction of the apparatus length in the 
	direction of motion of the earth. This <i>ad hoc</i> hypothesis could 
	explain the result of Michelson experiment, but this was simply an empirical 
	solution.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Einstein’s paper of 1905 
	brought the solution in a general way. His analytical approach based on two 
	basic postulates: &nbsp;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
		<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In all inertial 
			frame of reference light travels with constant speed, whether an 
			observer is at rest in one frame or an observer is on a train moving 
			with an uniform speed does not matter.</li>
			<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">All physical laws 
			– Mechanical as well Electromagnetic laws, must remain invariant 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Under these two axioms, 
	meaning of Lorentz’s contraction comes out to be that `length is frame 
	dependent – i.e. if L<sub>o</sub> is the length of an object (such as length 
	of the spectrometer arm along the direction of motion) with respect to a 
	frame at rest, and L is the length of the same object that is fixed in a 
	uniformly moving reference frame with respect to the fixed frame. In general 
	L<sub>o</sub> <span style="font-family: Symbol">¹</span> L but could related 
	as : L =&nbsp; L<sub>o</sub><span style="font-family: Symbol">Ö</span>(1- v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> 
	). This means a moving object would appear to be shortened by the factor (1- 
	v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> )<sup> 1/2</sup> . In a similar way it has been 
	shown that it was established that time interval between two events
	<span style="font-family: Symbol">d</span>t in a fixed frame would not be 
	the same interval in a uniformly moving frame, but say
	<span style="font-family: Symbol">d</span>t`. This means time is not an 
	invariant entity, but observer dependent. In this case time interval is 
	lengthened in the moving system which could be expressed in a simple 
	mathematical relation :&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Symbol">d</span>t` =&nbsp;
	<span style="font-family: Symbol">d</span>t/ (<span style="font-family: Symbol">Ö</span>(1- 
	v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup> ).&nbsp; This means if we have two clocks 
	synchronized to each other when both systems were at rest, then as one 
	system starts moving with uniform speed, the observer at rest frame would 
	see that clock at moving frame tickling slowly. This is what we call time 
	dilation. The time dilation has been experimentally verified in meson decay 
	process. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Prof. Shafi then introduced 
	the concept of four-dimensional world and gave some brief description 
	through four dimensional geometrical analysis involving space and time due 
	to Minkoski and Poincare. In the light of relativistic approach when a 
	particle moves near velocity of light, Newtonian mechanics which was 
	modified by Einstein now known as relativistic mechanics from which his 
	famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup> was obtained showing the mass–energy 
	equivalence. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The author then tried to 
	explain the very well known twin paradox in a lucid language to 
	non-conversant audience. He narrated a story, in the context of his Bengali 
	audience, of a twin sister Mona and Lisa; Lisa under took a space journey in 
	rocket nearly moving with speed of light. As they are in relative motion, 
	not knowing who are at rest, both sisters will see that other sister’s clock 
	is moving slowly. After some time, Lisa returned to his sister Mona; Mona 
	saw that her sister has come back after 8 years i.e. her age has increased 
	by as against Lisa’s age only 4 years. On the other hand Lisa will notice 
	that her age increased by 8 years (in her own frame of reference) and Mona’s 
	only by 4 years. Both can’t be true – so it is a paradox. Where lies the 
	mystery? Explanation is not that difficult. Mona’s reference frame always 
	remained unaltered. But when Lisa started her journey her frame was moving 
	away from Mona, but on her return path she was not in the same reference 
	frame, it was now moving opposite direction towards Mona, so it is a 
	different frame, although Lisa thought she was at rest always. Hence Lisa 
	would see Mona’s clock behaving differently as compared to when she was 
	moving away. In return path Lisa would see that her sister Mona is 
	approaching to her with same speed. The net result is Lisa would see that 
	Mona’s clock has recorded eight years more as compared to her clock. So time 
	traveler Lisa would conquer the time by four years and look younger compared 
	to her sister Mona who spent all the time on earth in inertia. So one who 
	wants to longer old age our doctor should prescribe for space travel. </p>
