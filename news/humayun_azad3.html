  liberation. Request<br>

  <p align="left"><i>thanks</i></p>
  <p>Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninist) -:Liberation takes a very
  serious note of the dastardly act by the fundamentalists and the
  religious-political hoodlums of Bangladesh of stabbing Prof Humayun Azad on
  the last day of Book Fair at Dhaka.</p>
  <p>We have pretty convincing reasons to believe that the present party in
  Government cannot absolve themselves of the responsibility. Bangladesh is now
  harbouring the most nefarious type of religious-fundamentalists and fascist
  terrorists. They are aided by Empire money directly and indirectly through the
  government channels as well. The imperialist designs of rendering Bangladesh
  an “unmanageable country” fits into the grand agenda of the US Empire and
  the international enemies of the people. The attack on Humayun Azad is just
  another step in the well-designed agenda of slowly shedding Bangladesh of the
  rational intelligentsia, who could be the leading voices against Empire,
  imperialism, religious-fanaticism and fascism. The vacuous battle cry against
  Islamic fundamentalism and religious terrorism by US Empire is nothing but
  hogwash. US imperialism and Islamic fundamentalism and in fact Indian Saffron
  Fascism are quite in hand and glove with each other.</p>
  <p>In the recent past couple of months the rational opinion leaders of
  Bangladesh are being attacked with full connivance of the Bangladesh
  administration and the ruling party goons. We are shocked and not bemused to
  see the crass inaction by the Bangladesh Government in nabbing the culprits.
  The culprits walked away in full daylight and even after being identified the
  authorities did not lift their little anatomy against them.</p>
  <p>The Indian progressive intelligentsia stand firmly by their Bangladeshi
  counterparts in their struggle against the common enemies of the South Asian
  people. Prof Azad belonged to the same corps of rational and conscientious
  fighters against the forces of reaction across the entire South Asia.</p>
  <p>We join the multitude of Bangladeshis who are now fighting their daily
  chores and battles against the anti-people government. The struggling voices
  from the Battlefields of India join the voices from Bangladesh. Our fight is
  one and the same.</p>
  <p>We, on behalf of the revolutionary forces of India, decline to express any
  sadness and frustration in this ghastly incident. We express our deepest
  ANGER, our WRATH, and our disdain against the ruling elite of Bangladesh. Not
  only in terms of mere solidarity but also in full camaraderie we too carry on
  our own struggle in our own soil against the SAFFRON fascism of India. We
  realize that Saffron fascism of India boosts a counteracting fascism in
  Bangladesh; therefore we consider our fight and the fight of the Bangladeshi
  comrades against their ruling fascists quite integrally connected</p>
  <p>Since the moment Prof Azad fell on the Dhaka pavement in pool of blood, we
  all the progressives of South Asia join the same struggle from every corners
  of South Asia. COUNT US ALONG!</p>
  <p>TURN ALL OUR GUNS AGAINST THE RULERS OF SOUTH ASIA!</p>

  (1972), an internationally recognized lawyer and expert on constitutional law,
  a human rights advocate and founder of Ain-O-Shalishi Kendra (Center for Law

  <p>STATEMENT OF PROTEST FROM LONDON BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PERSONALITIES</p>
  <p>It is with deep regret and sorrow we are giving you the news of attack on
  Dr. Humayun Azad. This dastardly attack is threatening to cut short a life of
  a scholar and noted historian who was never afraid to speak of what he
  believed.</p>
  <p>Motives for the attempt on Dr. Azad's life could not be known immediately,
  but co-authors and the victim's family blamed a fundamentalist section that
  threatened him with death for the launch of his latest work 'Pak Sar Zamin
  Saad Baad' in November.&quot; Recently, a jamat leader Delwar Hossain Saidi
  demanded its banning and punishment of the author.</p>
  <p>We, the following organization and people, are deeply outraged by this
  incident and express our strongest protest. We urge upon the government to
  take immediate measures to protect fundamental human rights and punish the
  culprits.</p>

  </p>
  <p><b>Protest continues</b></p>
  <p><b>DU Campus:</b></p>
  <p>Different students organization brought out processions including Chhatra
  League and government supporting students wing of BNP. The BNP student front
  held a meeting in the campus. The speakers demanding culprits to rounded off
  alleged that AL has done this. This is not strange as their chairperson Begum
  Khaleda set the tune on 28th February in a public meeting at Dhaka. The
  Students League on the other hand pointed their fingers to Jamatis and other
  fundamentalists group, and at the same time they blamed the government
  Khaleda_Nizami for creating smoke around the incident by uttering
  irresponsible remarks on the part of the PM against AL.</p>
  <p>General students under the banner ‘We want trial of attackers of Dr.
  Humayun Azad’ brought out a rally, and held a day long meeting in front of
  the ‘Aparajeya Bangla’ in which speakers demanded resignation of home
  minister, elimination of terrorism from the campus, and exemplary punishment
  of the attackers. The speakers also condemned the PM and other BNP leaders
  including our bachal (talkative) home minister for making utterances to create
  confusion with a view to protect the real culprits.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#ff0000" size="5"><b><img alt="DU Teachers" src="azad008.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="450"></b></font></p>
  <p>The teachers today also abstained from the class in pretest of attempted
  murder of Dr. Azad. They also held sitting strike in front of the Arts
  Building. Many teachers too part in the sit down strike. Artist Hashem Khan,
  Dr. Muntasir Mamun and Dr. Golum Rahman spoke condemning Government’s
  attempt to cover the Jamati culprits by uttering irresponsible utterances by
  the PM and the home minister.</p>
  <p><b>Central Shahid Minar</b></p>
  <p>A mass rally was held under the auspices of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote
  (Combined Cultural Unity) in which all class of people joined... common
  people, artists, writers, political party leaders and cultural personalities.
  The speakers condemned the incident and blamed the government ’s failure to
  maintain a minimum standard of law and order in the country. In the very
  presence of a large number police force deployed in and around Bangla Academy
  premises, the attempted killers not only fatally injured Dr. Humayun Azad, a
  noted author and a university professor but also made their escape with ease.
  Why then deploy such bahini spending every day a huge amount of sum for them ?
  What is the use of maintaining such a big force with poor public money if it
  proves useless in need? Would you answer this simple questions, madam prime
  minister to your electorate? Do you have any? I wonder.</p>
  <p><b>Protest Meeting Held by Ghtak Dalal Nirmul Kamiti</b></p>
  <p>A protest meeting was also held at the BWV auditorium at Dhanmondi at 4-30
  p.m. The meeting was presided over by Professor Kabir Chouduhury. A largely
  attended meeting was addressed by a galaxy of elites of our society, which
  included among others:</p>
  <p>Poet Shamsur Rahman Poet Sayed Shamsul Haq Professor Mustafa Nurul Islam
  Professor Ajoy Roy Justice K M Sobhan Dr. A. K. Azad Choudhury Dr. Muntasir
  Mamun Dr. Harun ar Rashid Dr. Borhan udddin Khan Jahangir Dr. Mubaswer Ulla
  Choudhury Artist Rafiqunnabi Artist Hashem Khan Mr. Shahriar Kabir Mrs.
  Shyamali Nasrin Choudhury</p>
  <p>All the speakers expressed that the present Khaleda_Nizami government has
  depicted itself as a fascist government and the BD as a police state in which
  none is safe who holds dissenting voice whether he is an AL, a left oriented
  politician, a liberal minded writer, a democrat believing in secularism and
  pluralism, a humanist protesting against human rights violation in any form, a
  free thinker, or even a common man if he is not a 4-party alliance supporter.
  They call upon all the social forces and liberal and left political parties to
  launch a united movement against the fascist state force and the
  communal-fundamentalist forces from a common platform.</p>

  &nbsp;It is stunningly surprising to see that the similarities between 7<sup>th</sup>
  century assassinations and 21<sup>st</sup> century assassination are 100%
  copy-cat. Both the ancient assassinations and modern assassinations are
  identical by both the <b><u>cause</u> </b>and <b><u>method</u>.</b> Yes, I am
  talking about the recent heinous assassination attempt of Prof. Humayon Azad
  by the Islamic goons. One and only reason why Islamic jihadis targeted him was
  his relentless criticism of Islam and Islamic fundamentalists in <ST1>
  <ST1>
  Bangladesh</ST1>
  </ST1>
  . In the past he wrote many books in which he very courageously parodied some
  untold incongruities of Islam. Some of his books were banned in <ST1>
  <ST1>
  Bangladesh</ST1>
  </ST1>
  . His recent book “<b>Pak-Sar-Zamin-Shad-Bad</b>” was a fabulously written
  book in which he very successfully <b>lampooned</b> exposing the heinous
  activities of Bangladeshi Islamists/Jihadis (read Jamatis, Al-badr, Al-Shams)
  during Bangalees freedom war in 1971. Peaceful (?) Islamists could tolerate no
  more! They continuously sent him death threats by phone and by letters.
  Razakar Maoulana Sayeedi and others issued open fatwas to punish this murtad—<b><span>the
  enemy of Allah and Prophet</span></b>. They decided to assassin him by the
  Islamic style-<i>a la</i> tactics of Muhammad-the holy Prophet of Islam.</p>

  &nbsp;Honorable readers, do you see astounding similarities between the

  <p class="Blockquote">In both cases (Ancient and modern) the causes and
  methods are identically 100% similar. Perhaps, many can not quite conceive why
  these Islamic goons used <i>Chapatis</i> (read sword of Bangalees) and Axes to
  assassinate Bangali Murtads instead of using simple and sure method of
  bullets. This is because they are the true Muslims and true followers of the
  best human Prophet Muhammad. It’s not true that they have any shortage of
  guns and pistols. But they are afraid to disobeying Prophet’s methods and
  tactics. They are desperate to get full benefits (<i>getting lucrative Islamic
  heavens as promised by the Quran</i>) of their service to Islam. Therefore
  they are bound to use Prophetic methods (read Islamic style) of assassinating
  the enemies of Allah and Prophet by silting necks, cutting hands and legs by
  Bangladeshi sword (read chapatti, ax, knives).</p>
  <p class="Blockquote"><O>
  &nbsp;Hope it is now clear why Islamic goons are cutting necks (Zabai),
  chopping wrists, hands and legs of anybody who dare to go against Allah and
  Prophet throughout the Khalrda-Nizamis new Islamized Bangladesh. Insaallah—<ST1>
  <ST1>
  Bangladesh</ST1>

  future. They have their hit list and these time under the well protection and

  1971) will finish their entire Islamic task which they could not finish in
  1971, simply because of the intervention by the neighboring Kaffirs of India.

  <h1 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">Humayun Azad and a
  few Self-Criticisms</font></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="4">By Dr. Asif Nazrul</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><br>
  <font size="3">Translated by: Mahbubul Karim (Sohel)<br>
  March 6, 2004</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Professor Humayun
  Azad used to refer white group as the group of purity. In 1987 the white
  group, composed of Dhaka University’s teachers, arranged a meeting under the
  leadership of Sirazul Islam, and Dr. Azad was one of the main speakers in that
  meeting. He had participated in the Senate Election under the same white
  party, and once he had performed his duty as the warden of international
  dormitory.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He did not actively
  participate in the white party for long, and neither did he join in another
  faction. Instead, as a truth seeker, this academician delved entirely into
  writing for his self-development of social thoughts and freethinking. He
  became the bearer of free, independent and greed-less pen. That pen would
  become a threat for his life; this premonition was there for many years.
  Political parties and various related groups who misuse religion demanded the
  banning of his writings. Several threats to his life cropped up more than
  once, and at last, that threat became the truth in his life.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In his writings,
  dark or darkness related issues used to emerge in roundabout way. He tried to
  elucidate dark as the fundamentalists, the anti-democratic forces who are
  against the progress and the progressives. To him, darkness represented all
  forms of activities in contrast to the betterment of humanity. His stance
  against the dark was always consistent, constant and resolute. Like many other
  Bangladeshi writers, by writing against darkness, he did not get involved with
  other similar detrimental or less murky politics. Consequently, though there
  might be different opinions on the intensity of his writings, still, every
  person with freethinking capacity respected him wholeheartedly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This is the reason
  that the barbaric attack on Humayun Azad has saddened and also flared up
  people of Bangladesh. This attack is seen as the attack on Bangladeshi
  cultural and intellectual soul. People have become louder in their protest
  against fundamentalism forces that are deemed as the opposition to the
  progressives. Nonetheless, is this instantaneous and reactionary protest
  enough for today’s background? Before this protest stifled, with our demand
  for justice to be served on the attackers of Humayun Azad, we must take
  consideration many other issues. We must deduce the BNP and Awami League’s
  opportunistic politics relating to fundamentalists and communalism.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Only a few days
  before Humayun Azad was attacked, the leader of Jamaat-E-Islami, Delowar
  Hossain Sayedi had uttered speeches with provocative messages against his
  writings. As far as I know, no one protested against his speech then. The
  political parties were out of the question and even the writers and cultural
  activists were mute. Then our political attention, perhaps, was centered on
  BNP and Awami League’s various violent activities. But we have forgotten
  that before the last general election, these two parties had promised to the
  nation for developing harmonious political movement that espouses tolerance.
  When they discussed with the former American president Jimmy Carter, promises
  were made on very specific issues. Among these issues, there was proposed
  commitment in not calling strikes, electing deputy speaker from the opposition
  parties, for the sake of preserving neutrality the resignation of the speaker
  from his political affiliation, conducting the parliament following the rules
  of business. To the people of Bangladesh, these two main leaders promised to
  strengthen democracy.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Just aftermath of
  the announcement of election 2001 result, these two major political parties
  forgot all these past promises. On one side the strikes, and on the other side
  the autocratic way of running the parliament and the nation, these two
  venomous political processes swallowed the nation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It
  didn’t take long for the same old conflict ridden imageries to return as
  they were just after the fall of Ershad government. Once again, for the Awami
  League, it became way more urgent to face BNP in battles than resisting the
  Jamaat or communalism infested politics. And for BNP, it became essential
  taking vengeance against Awami League. For this reason alone, BNP never
  flinched in sharing of running the nation with Jamaat-E-Islami. If opportunity
  arises in future, for this same reason of mutual hatred, Awami League, in most
  likelihood, would not back away from combining with Jamaat in political
  struggles once again as they did in the past.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Accordingly, under
  this strange circumstance, in the last one decade, the communalist force that
  opposes progressive groups, attained sizzling power in almost uncontestable
  efforts. For this gaining of unprecedented power by Jamaat and other communal
  forces, failures of running the government by the two major political parties
  contributed greatly as their never ending violence did the same. Awami League
  and BNP have failed, Ershad is an old man, the left is not comprehensible –
  under this scenario, the alternative force can be Jamaat – this type of
  devastating thoughts have convinced between far and few. It has been curiously
  observed that the BNP ministers have praised “Shibir” more than “Chatrodol”.
  And on the other hand, Awami League was seen more vocal against BNP than
  Jamaat.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The most
  unfortunate thing is that due to the violent polarization between BNP and
  Awami League, the professional organizations have become divided or simply
  acrimonious to each other; civil society and even newspaper columnists have
  shown the similar acute divergence. During the past struggles against Ershad
  government’s autocratic rule, the professional organizations and groups had
  powerful rise and development against autocracy and fundamentalism, but in the
  so-called “democratic” government, their effects were curtailed, even in
  many cases had become obsolete. By blindingly supporting or resisting BNP or
  Awami League’s all just or unjust actions or policy without condition, a
  large number of organizations of our civil society have become weak,
  collectively and morally. In approximately after the death of Jahanara Imam,
  the movement against fundamentalism and communalism have all but dissipated.
  It is the negligence of the civil society that became the fertile ground for
  the rising of the communal forces. But on this very time of national and
  international unstable state of affairs, it was imperative to resist these
  communal forces.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What is the meaning
  of opposing fundamentalism and communalism? The meaning is obvious. There is
  no need to embark on a festooned war opposing them. What is needed is
  practicing the real democracy, establishing constitutional and lawful
  government, and needs for the civil society to fulfill their managerial
  responsibility, neutrally and with unity. If we had had a effective
  parliament, an independent police force and justice department, human rights
  commission, and if there were real efforts in BNP and Awami League for
  practicing democracy, and the bare minimum mutual patience and respect for
  each other existed, in that scenario, the politics of fundamentalists and
  communalists would have become weak on its own course. Then the life of
  writers, journalists, cultural activists or the general people would have been
  safer.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Without
  accomplishing this goal, and only blaming the fundamentalists for the barbaric
  attack on Professor Humayun Azad type of prominent writer, would not bear any
  fruits. It was the fundamentalist force that had the most imperative
  implementing this attack. However, at the same time, we must not forget that
  in the past, the attack on Rashed Khan Menon was blamed on the fundamentalist
  force that was proven to be wrong afterward. In many other previous cases in
  the past, other allegations for violence and terrorism against the communalist
  were not proven either, and indeed, there were many cases that were proven. We
  should demand that the government should unearth the culprits, whoever they
  are, with honest approach. The responsible criminals should get their deserved
  justice in speedy justice process. If justice were served, without deceit, in
  this specific case, the attacks on freethinkers would diminish in many folds.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is no reason
  for not being able to do this. Humayun Azad was taken swiftly to the Combined
  Military Hospital because of fast and prudent actions done by the Vice
  Chancellor of Dhaka University and the proctor. And for getting good treatment
  from the military hospital, Humayun Azad perhaps will return to us, completely
  recovered. Then the investigation can expect to get inputs from Dr. Azad
  solving this heinous crime. And still, there is no reason for the government
  not being able to expose the conspiracy behind this transgression. By
  insinuating that Awami League was behind this attack, government has already
  done considerable damage in this investigation. Government must realize that
  it should discard this policy of shifting blame, and right this moment they
  should take urgent steps for arresting the responsible culprits behind this
  incident, and place them under the law so that justice is served. If
  necessary, they should seek assistance from Scotland Yard types of efficient
  investigative force.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If the government
  fails to serve justice for the attack on Humayun Azad, the current and future
  generations will not forgive them.<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">On
  that fateful Friday, Dr Azad, in jeans and fatua, had been sitting in the
  stall of Agami Prokashani at the Ekushey Book Fair. He left the stall at
  around 8:45 PM; &quot;Dr Azad left the mela, telling me he would go
  home,&quot; says Osman Gani, owner of the publishing house. It was around
  9:30, a young man approached him for an autograph; Dr Azad crossed the road
  for a rickshaw after signing the autograph. And then two unknown assailants,
  armed with chopping knives hacked the 56-year-old writer on the jaw, lower
  part of the neck and hands, on the pavement outside the academy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Conscious
  but profusely bleeding, Dr Azad, who has authored over 70 books, was taken to
  the emergency unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). According to
  newspaper reports, no doctor was available at the emergency unit of the DMCH.
  Later, Dr Azad was sent to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Dr
  Azad's attackers, might have come right out of his book, <em>Pak Sar Jamin
  Sadd Baad</em> (Pakistan's national anthem: Blessed be the Sacred Land). It
  depicts the story of a religious fanatic who wants to establish a
  &quot;Taliban-styled distorted Pakistan&quot; in Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="178" src="cover02.jpg" width="250" align="left">The
  protagonist, a member of the Jama'-e-Jihad-e Islam Party, says in a monologue,
  &quot;We aren't alone. Our brothers all over the world are doing their work.
  If they fly an aeroplane into a building somewhere, if cars crash into a
  hospital or a hotel, or if a bomb blast kills 300 people in some recreational
  centre, then we know it's the work of our brothers; in other words, it is our
  work. This is Jihad.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">The
  name, Jama'-e-Jihad-e Islam Party, is believed to be an allegory to the
  Jamat-e-Islami Bangladesh (JI), a partner in the ruling coalition; as another
  character in the book, Karim Ali Islampuri says, &quot;We must seize power.
  Right now, we are with the power and the main party. At some point, power will
  come to us; we will become the main party. We are entering everywhere -- Islam
  will be established; (another) Pakistan will be created. There won't be any
  infidels, Malauns (Hindus); there won't be any Hindu or Jew in guise of
  Muslims.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Dr
  Azad's novel, however, meets a melodramatic end. The zealot goes through a
  dramatic change of heart-- he falls in love with a Hindu girl; and later
  abandons the path of religious bigotry and intolerance.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="206" src="cover03.jpg" width="300" align="right">But

  files that included news of protests against him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">In
  fact, on January 25, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, an MP belonging to JI called for
  the introduction of the Blasphemy Act to block the publication of &quot;such
  books&quot;. Besides Sayeedi--who once called for blood tests for journalists
  to see &quot;if they are Muslims or not&quot;-- many bigots have declared the
  maverick writer a <em>murtad</em> (apostate). From an anti-Ahmadiyya rally on
  December 12, Momtazi, emir of Hifazate Khatm-e-Nabuat Movement and the Imam of
  Rahim Metal Mosque demanded the professor's arrest and trial.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Nothing
  has ever deterred Dr Azad, perhaps, the lone outspoken writer in Bangla
  literature, from speaking out his mind. Azad has even denounced some of his
  contemporaries, describing their novels as opponnayash (degenerated novel). Be
  it in writing against military bureaucracy or dictatorship in the guise of
  democracy, Dr Azad, with his iconoclastic views, has always stood out.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Though,
  teachers at the university have been divided along the line of their political
  allegiance, Dr Azad has kept a safe distance from both the BNP backed White
  and AL backed Blue factions. In fact, Latifa Kohinur, Dr Azad's wife, cannot
  remember him going to the polling booths, even, to vote for the general
  elections. Though everyone does not subscribe to his opinion, Dr Azad's
  writings have always generated much enthusiasm among the readers for his
  fierce criticism of the establishment. But through his candid statements on
  the political use of religion, the writer has certainly earned the wrath of a
  certain quarter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="209" src="cover04.jpg" width="300" align="left">Actually,
  according to Latifa, the writer used to receive phone calls &quot;five or six
  years ago&quot; that threatened to kill the linguist for writing &quot;un-islamic&quot;
  things. &quot;I used to get phone calls five or six years ago…They would
  say, 'You will get Humayun Azad's corpse on the street… You will be a widow
  soon', and so on,&quot; Latifa says. But the threats suddenly stopped coming
  in one day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Even
  after the publication of <em>Pak Saar Jamin Saad Baad</em>, the family members
  did not receive any such call, Latifa says. But she became anxious for her
  husband's safety when &quot;a religious fundamentalist outfit called for Dr
  Azad's trial and the banning of Pak Saar Jamin Saad Baad &quot;. That anxiety
  turned into fear after Sayeedi's infamous demand in the parliament.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Latifa
  couldn't hide her anger on the night of February 27 at the CMH.
  &quot;Fundamentalists (zealots) have done this… Who else could do this? You
  know an MP even verbaly abused him in the parliament,&quot; she said.
  &quot;Why didn't you take security measures to protect him after such an
  outrage in parliament?&quot; Latifa asked Lutfuzzaman Babar, state minister
  for home, when he went to visit Dr Azad in hospital.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Though
  the police had claimed to have &quot;cordoned off&quot; the area immediately
  after the attack, the agitating students of Dhaka university, who had been
  demanding the home minister's resignation, recovered another blood soaked
  Chapati (chopping knife) from the spot on the following day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="224" src="cover05.jpg" width="300" align="right">The
  police, however, arrested Abbas, alias Boma Abbas, joint secretary of Sir AF
  Rahman Hall unit of Bangladesh Chatra League. &quot;We have information about
  his presence near the spot before and after the incident. And there was a bomb
  explosion during the attack, he might be involved in the crime,&quot; Officer
  in Charge of Ramna Police Station Mahabubur Rahman said; Abbas has a history
  of bomb-making, the police officer alleged. The case was later handed over to
  the CID; and though the state minister for home has promised to give the case
  highest priority, the police are yet to unearth any motive behind the attack.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">The
  attack on Dr Azad and the police's failure to nab the culprits have angered
  general people. The Dhaka University Teachers' Association has called an
  indefinite strike demanding the home minister's resignation. The anger turned
  into fury when armed hoodlums belonging to the Jatioyatabadi Chatra Dal (JCD),
  attacked peaceful procession of the general students on March 4. It is not
  clear, though, as to how a peaceful demonstration demanding the arrest of Dr
  Azad's killers can anger the ruling party's student wing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="205" src="cover06.jpg" width="400" align="left">To
  save its skin the government resorted to suspicious secrecy. When, immediately
  after the attack, the country held its breath to hear the latest condition of
  Dr Azad, the government even barred journalists from entering the CMH
  premises. It was an irregular, and in cases irresponsible, press-note of the
  Inter Service Public Relations that became the sole source of information for
  the anxious general people. The government's suspicious behaviour gave birth
  to a wide spread rumour of his death. Some government officials, when asked,
  came out with reports on his condition that were self-contradictory. Lately
  Azad's condition has, however, improved; and rumours died down when members of
  his family and Dr Azad's friends were allowed to visit him.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="117" src="cover07.jpg" width="120" align="right">The
  attack on Dr Azad, in every sense, is shocking. Though religious fanatics have
  declared many writers and intellectuals as apostates, in fact, this is the
  first time in our history, that a writer was physically assaulted for his
  work. The attack, in front of Bangla Academy, one of the glorious products of
  our language movement, sends a chilling message to those who still believe in
  freethinking.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">Everyone
  wanted to reap dividend from the attack on Dr Azad. While Dr Azad was fighting
  for life at the CMH, leaders of both the major political parities and
  intellectuals of their creeds kept themselves busy interpreting their own
  version of the event.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">&quot;I
  just want to see the man back home,&quot; says Latifa Kohinur. After 33 years
  of independence we cannot even be guaranteed security for our lives; forget
  free speech.</font></p>

  of a crowd of several thousands of a public meeting. It is the same old blame
  game where the government always accuses the opposition and the opposition
  retaliates by charging the government for every mishap or crime that occurs.
  Politicisation has been taken to a new level. It's no more just the police or
  BTV, history and National Days are being politicised. Politicisation is
  spreading its root and branch. Be it a bomb blast or a price hike the
  government invariably smells the opposition's foul play in it, while the
  opposition always points figures at the 'government's failure'.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">By
  resorting to wholesale accusations against each other instead of addressing
  the real issue, which though may earn them temporary success, in the long run
  they are losing their credibility. Unfortunately, our wise politicians seem to
  be unbelievably incapable of realising the gravity of the risk they are
  running.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="277" src="cover09.jpg" width="100" align="left">Just
  take the most recent example. Only 15 hours into the barbaric attack on
  Humayun Azad the PM blamed the AL, alleging that the attack was meant to
  create panic ahead of an AL-sponsored hartal. But she didn't provide any solid
  proof to substantiate her claim. Interestingly, she made the revelation at a
  time when the police investigation had just begun. And if we consider the fact
  that the investigation is still on and after 8 days since the PM's claim the
  police are yet to make any breakthrough into the case, the PM's declaration
  seems premature and undesirable in retrospect. Such rash comments might very
  well make objective investigation impossible. Given the highly politicised
  nature of the police, it is quite likely that instead of conducting the
  investigation objectively the police might try to prove the PM's 'guess'
  right. What happens in the process is that the real criminals are allowed
  ample time and scope to melt in the air and plan for the next target.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2">That
  is exactly what has happened over and over again in the last few years, not
  only during the present government, but also when AL was in power. The way
  today's PM Khaleda Zia has hurried onto the conclusion that the attack on
  Humayun Azad was made by AL, appear to be almost a replay of the then PM
  Sheikh Hasina's allegation that BNP was the mastermind behind the tragic Ramna
  Botomul bomb blast that claimed 11 innocent lives. Another ghastly bomb blast
  in Paltan Maidan in a meeting arranged by the Communist party that killed
  seven people was also met with objectionable observations from Sheikh Hasina.
  She suggested that the bomb blast was a result of internal conflict of the
  Communist party within hours of the incidents, an accusation based on no
  evidence whatsoever.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333" size="2"><img height="194" src="cover10.jpg" width="250" align="right">The
  consequences are before us -- not a single criminal behind any of the
  high-profile sensational bomb blast incidents that left behind scores of dead
  bodies and hundreds of permanently maimed, mostly innocent persons, has been
  brought to justice. Bomb blasts have continued to kill innocent people and our
  political leaders have continued to capitalise those incidents for their petty
  political gain. But it has to be stopped, right now. We all have to raise our
  voice so that the government and the opposition don't play the blame game
  exploiting the barbaric attack on the life of Humayun Azad and are forced to
  find the criminals and bring them to book. We cannot allow terrorists to
  silence the voice of freedom.</font></p>
