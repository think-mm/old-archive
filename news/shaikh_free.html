	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">IHEU is pleased to announce that Dr 
    Younus Shaikh, who has been languishing in gaol in Pakistan since October 
    2000 and in solitary confinement under sentence of death for blasphemy since 
    August 2001, has been acquitted and freed after an appeal and retrial.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For the past three years IHEU has 
    led an international campaign to secure the release of our friend and 
    colleague. Dr Shaikh was declared a Prisoner of Conscience by Amnesty 
    International, and thousands of people worldwide lobbied their politicians 
    and the Government of Pakistan on his behalf. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Following his release in the 
    greatest secrecy on 21<sup>st</sup> November 2003 Younus Shaikh initially 
    remained in Pakistan but his accusers than lodged an appeal against his 
    acquittal, and he has now left Pakistan for Europe and safety.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Shaikh</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Mohammed Younus Shaikh was born in 
    Chishtian, Pakistan on 30<sup>th</sup> May 1952. After High School he 
    studied medicine in Multan where he qualified as a doctor of medicine, and 
    did post-graduate studies in Dublin and London. He worked as a trainee 
    surgeon in the United Kingdom from 1981 until 1988. He returned to Pakistan 
    where he taught at a medical college in Islamabad. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As a Human Rights activist in 
    Pakistan he attracted the attention of the Islamic fundamentalists. He took 
    part in the Pakistan-India Forum for Peace and Democracy, and was a member 
    of the South Asian Fraternity, South Asian Union and the Human Rights 
    Commission of Pakistan. In 1990 he started a Humanist organisation called 
    “The Enlightenment”, inspired by the ideas of the European Enlightenment and 
    Renaissance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Kashmir</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">At a meeting of the South Asian 
    Union on 1<sup>st</sup> October 2000, Younus Shaikh suggested that, in the 
    interest of the people of Kashmir, the line of control between the Indian 
    and Pakistani forces should become the international border. This clearly 
    offended a Pakistani officer who responded by saying to Dr Shaikh that “I 
    will crush the heads of those that talk like this”. On 3<sup>rd</sup> 
    October Dr Shaikh was suspended by his college without explanation. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Later that evening, an employee of 
    the Pakistani Foreign Office, who was also one of Dr Shaikh’s students, 
    complained to a cleric, saying that on 2<sup>nd</sup> October in a lecture 
    between 12:00 noon and 12:40 pm, the doctor had made blasphemous remarks 
    about the Prophet of Islam. The cleric filed a complaint with the police. 
    Younus Shaikh was arrested on the evening of 4<sup>th</sup> October and 
    charged with blasphemy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Trial and Acquittal</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Those accused of blasphemy under 
    Article 295/C of the Pakistan Penal Code are unable to obtain bail and are 
    held in custody awaiting trial. If pronounced guilty, they face a mandatory 
    death sentence. The trial of Dr Shaikh, held throughout the summer of 2001, 
    took place in a hostile courtroom packed with Islamic fundamentalists who 
    warned the defence lawyers: “think of your families and children”. The final 
    two sessions were held in-camera with gun-toting Pakistani Taliban waiting 
    outside. It was finally established during the trial that the alleged events 
    had never taken place. Nevertheless, on 18<sup>th</sup> August 2001, Dr 
    Shaikh was found guilty and sentenced to death. Sadly, in Pakistan, such 
    injustices are not uncommon in cases of alleged blasphemy. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">For the next two years, Dr Shaikh 
    was held in solitary confinement in a death cell in the Central Gaol in 
    Rawalpindi. He appealed to the High Court but the two appeal court judges 
    failed to agree. On 15<sup>th</sup> July 2002 the case was referred to a 
    senior judge for a final decision.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">A delay of more than a year then 
    ensued before the referee judge took up the case. On October 9<sup>th</sup> 
    2003, this judge finally decided that the original judgement was unsound but 
    instead of acquitting Dr Shaikh, remanded the case back to a lower court for 
    retrial. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The retrial was held over three 
    sessions in November 2003. In the light of the harassment and intimidation 
    suffered by his lawyers at the earlier hearings, and much against the advice 
    of the judge, his colleagues, his family and the members of the diplomatic 
    community present in court, Dr Shaikh decided this time to conduct his own 
    defence. The prosecuting counsel tried to exploit the religious feelings of 
    the court but Dr Shaikh confined his defence to legal arguments and was 
    finally acquitted on 21<sup>st</sup> November. He tells us that he was 
    inspired by the defence speech of Sir Thomas More in “A Man for All 
    Seasons”. Fortunately for Dr Shaikh the outcome this time was different.
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Commenting on the judgement, Dr 
    Shaikh explained: “The judge accepted my legal arguments and found the 
    charges against me to be baseless. My accusers, two Mullahs and some 
    Islamist students, had lied.” He described his ordeal as: “Islamic terrorism 
    through the abuse of law and of the state apparatus.”</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Escape to Freedom</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dr Shaikh was released from the gaol 
    in great secrecy, was offered, but refused, a police bodyguard, and went 
    into hiding for several weeks, meeting family and friends and even 
    participating, incognito, in a debate on Human Rights. He has now left 
    Pakistan for Europe.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Many victims of the Pakistani 
    blasphemy laws have failed to survive prison, and a number of those tried 
    and acquitted have been murdered following their release. As recently as 
    July 2002, Mohammed Yousaf was shot dead inside the Central Gaol in Lahore 
    while awaiting his appeal. On 7<sup>th</sup> February 2003, Mushtaq Zafar, a 
    55 year-old man accused of blasphemy was shot dead on his way home from the 
    High Court. And in June 2003, Naseem Bibi, 35, who had been the victim of a 
    gang rape by police, was&nbsp; charged with blasphemy, and was murdered in prison 
    before her trial could begin.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Even the legal profession are not 
    immune from attack. Defence lawyers have been intimidated by fundamentalists 
    and even a High Court judge was murdered after acquitting an accused. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This week, one of Dr Shaikh’s 
    supporters, speaking anonymously from Islamabad said:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><br>
    “We may draw some satisfaction and&nbsp;may even feel like celebrating that our 
    efforts in pursuing this case led to&nbsp;the acquittal of Dr. Sheikh, but let's 
    not forget that as long as the Blasphemy law is on the statute book, it will 
    continue to be misused. At this very moment there are several innocent 
    people, victims of this black law,&nbsp;languishing in various jails and lock-ups 
    of the country awaiting an uncertain future. And these victims may not be as 
    fortunate as Dr. Sheikh was. Dr. Sheikh had a circle of committed friends 
    inside and outside the country.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It is also a sad 
    reflection on the state and&nbsp;society of Pakistan that even when&nbsp;individuals 
    are exonerated by law of any guilt,&nbsp;they are forced to flee the country 
    for&nbsp;their safety. The state or society is unable or unwilling to provide 
    them protection. Dr. Sheikh was not at all eager to leave the country. If he 
    had a choice he would have stayed with his family </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">and friends. I could see his 
    reluctance to leave the country written large on his face when I accompanied 
    him to the airport.”<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The bottom line is that we must continue our campaign until 
    this draconian law, along with similar other medieval laws, is undone or at 
    least modified to save the innocent people from its abuse.” </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pakistan’s infamous blasphemy laws 
    are widely abused to make false accusations against both Muslims and members 
    of religious minorities, such as Christians and Ahmadis, as well as innocent 
    business rivals and political opponents. Those accused under the blasphemy 
    laws are immediately imprisoned with no effective right to bail. If 
    pronounced guilty, they face a mandatory death sentence. It is estimated 
    that over 100 victims of Pakistan’s medieval blasphemy laws are currently in 
    prison either awaiting trial or already under sentence of death. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The international Humanist community 
    calls upon President Parvez Musharraf and the Pakistani Parliament to 
    immediately abolish these profoundly unjust laws – an ugly stain on the 
    reputation of the nation and people of Pakistan.</span></p>

Subject: Dr Younis Sheikh is free at last
Date: Fri, 23 Jan 2004 14:33:55 +0100

Dear All,

We rejoice in the acquittal of Dr Younis Sheikh from all charges of
blasphemy levelled against him. Asiapeace along with many other
organizations engaged itself in the campaign for his release from a
Pakistani jail. He has apparently arrived in Geneva safe and soundly.

1.	Dr Mubarik Ali (member Asiapeace, Lahore) provides the
information and Owais Hasin (member Asiapeace, Karachi) sent it to me.
2.	Dr Maqsood Choudhry (member Asiapeace, Sanginaw, Michigin) makes
some observations in this regard.

Best regards,

Ishtiaq Ahmed
