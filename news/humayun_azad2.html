  <p><br>
  Only few days ago a nervous but determined writer, Prof. Humayun Azad, sent
  e-mail to the moderator of a forum for freethinkers by the name <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com"><b>Mukto-Mona</b></a>.
  Prof. Azad is a member of the forum. He wrote, &quot;Dear Rahul, The Ittefaq
  published a novel by me named Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad in the Eid Issue in
  December 03. It deals with the condition of Bangladesh for the last two years.
  Now the fundamentalists are bringing out regular processions against me,
  demanding exemplary punishment. Attached two files with this letter will help
  you understand.&quot; Dr. Azad enclosed to JPG files that contained news items
  including a photo of fundamentalists protesting against him outside the
  national mosque in downtown Dhaka.</p>
  <p>Prof. Azad's premonition came true. The goons perhaps hired by the bunch
  that hates Prof. Azad struck outside Boi Mela (Book Exhibition Center). Hours
  after a bunch of assailants descended on Prof. Humayun Azad's body to silence
  his voice for ever, I received an e-mail from news forum &quot;Future of
  Bangladesh.&quot; A kind member from Dhaka frantically wrote, &quot;A little
  while back (Dhaka, February 27, 2004 at 9:30) eminent writer Humayun Azad was
  attacked in front of Bangla Academy by a group of unknown assailants with
  chopping knives and has been grievously injured. Channel I has just now showed
  a completely blood drenched Azad being brought by the police to Dhaka Medical
  College Hospital and given primary treatment. His face, hands, T-shirt,
  trouser everything was soaked in blood. His condition is serious.&quot;
  <p>An hour later, the same person from Dhaka who sent earlier an e-mail sent a
  grim message: &quot;Humayun Azad has been shifted to CMH as his condition
  turned worse.&quot; My telephone started to ring immediately. My friends who
  write passionately on liberal issues pertaining to Bangladesh were very much
  perturbed hearing the sad news of an attempt on Prof. Azad's life.
  <p>Unless you are out of sync with news from Bangladesh, you perhaps are well
  acquainted with the fact that the tiny country of 140 million has become very
  intolerant as of late. Only years ago, another Bangalee writer, Poet Shamsur
  Rahman, was attacked by some goons in the privacy of his own house. The
  attackers could not do more harm then because of the immediate action by the
  poet's neighbors. The Mullahs in Bangladesh have also given threats to Taslima
  Nasrin. Mind you, these are not idle threats.
  <p>This time the goons have targeted Prof. Azad. It is worth mentioning here
  that Prof. Azad's recent writings included in his book &quot;Pak Sar Zamin
  Saad Baad&quot; have drawn attention from Jamaat leaders. Maulana Delwar
  Hossain Saidee, one of the most garrulous Jamaat MP, and his followers have
  asked the Khaleda Zia Administration to ban Prof. Azad's book. On February 28,
  2004, the Daily Star reporting on attempted assassination of Prof. Azad wrote,
  &quot;Addressing a demonstration at Baitul Mukarram National Mosque on
  December 12, leaders of an anti-Ahmadiyya outfit demanded arrest and trial of
  Prof Azad for the novel.&quot;
  <p>Freedom loving Bangalees from all walks of life should denounce this
  heinous attack on one of the luminaries of Bangladesh's literati, Prof.
  Humayun Azad. Intolerance against liberal writers is on the rise in
  Bangladesh, which is symptomatic of a wholesale Islamisation of Bangladesh. I
  am confident other freethinkers and secularists would pen protest notes
  against this barbaric attack on Professor Azad. The government should
  apprehend the perpetrators of this crime and bring an end to this kind of
  attack on intelligentsia and freethinkers.
  <p>Free speech is a hallmark of liberal democracy and Bangladesh society
  should go an extra mile to foster free speech everywhere in our ancestral
  land. Prof. Humayun Azad has many followers in expatriate communities who
  would express their anger through posting in myriad Internet forums. I urge
  the Bangladesh government to investigate the matter thoroughly and see what
  role avowed detractors of liberal writers have played in this barbaric attack.

    <br>
    Humayun Azad lies in a coma at CMH. Rumours fly about his situation. Dhaka
    University has exploded with rage, and the rest of the city looks ready to
    boil over. In a desperate back-pedal to avoid blame, the government claims
    ignorance about who Azad's attackers may be. The Home Minister has even
    said: &quot;We are engaging all-out efforts to find out whether he was
    attacked for personal enmity or there were other schemes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Everyone knows who is ultimately responsible for this grisly incident.
    Azaad's assassins were actively or passively created by the virulent
    religious hatred being promoted by Jamaat, Islami Oikkyo Jote and other
    Islamist parties. On December 12, members of Khatme Nabuwwot addressed a
    gigantic demonstration of anti-Ahmadiyya fundamentalists at Baitul Mukarram
    Mosque. At that gathering, fiery speakers demanded the arrest and trial of
    Professor Azad for his novel &quot;Pak Sar Zamin Sad Bad&quot;. A month
    later, on January 25, Jamaat MP Delwar Hossain Sayeedi demanded introduction
    of a Blasphemy Act in parliament to block the publication of such books. Can
    there still be doubt about who has encouraged this bloody attack?<br>

    <br>
    A glance at Humayun Azad's recent book &quot;Amra Ki Ey Bangladesh
    Cheyechilam? (Is This The Bangladesh We Wanted?)&quot; reveal clear clues
    about the author's enemies.<br>
    <br>
    Discussing the insertion of Islam as State Religion into our constitution,
    Azad wrote:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;[Constitution says] 'Absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah
    shall be the basis of all state actions.' This is a clever trick to deceive
    the common, God-fearing man. In this country, Muslims have always followed
    their faith, and always will-- no one is stopping them. But using religion
    as a tool is trickery, a ploy to give the people nothing. They will promise
    the people heaven, but will not give them economic self-sufficiency. From
    the time of Zia, all our government functions have become competitions of
    religious sermons. If using religion [in government] was useful, Bangladesh
    should have become the world's most holy and developed nation. Instead, it
    has become the world's most corrupt nation. The corruption of religious
    politicians has destroyed the country.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Turning his attention to the Jamaat and its allies, Humayun blasted those
    who opposed Bangladesh's liberation and feel nostalgia for &quot;united
    Pakistan&quot;:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Our fathers committed a deadly mistake, a crime-- they made Bengal
    Pakistan. We did not want to stay sons of slaves, so we created Bangladesh.
    Now, let us imagine Bangladesh never became independent, we were still East
    Pakistan. What would we see around us? We would see the flag with moon and
    stars, we would hear 'Pak Sar Zamin Sad Bad', the Ministers would all be
    Punjabis, the army would be filled with Pathan and Punjabi Generals. Those
    who roar around in Pajeros today-- they would be standing on the roadside
    shaking in front of those same jeeps. The Adamjis, Dauds, Bawanis, and
    Kabuliwalas would run this country. We would be happy to lick the dust off
    their feet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    From the 1970s, the BNP has actively rehabilitated the Jamaat and other
    Islamic parties. Today that party has grown into a snake that is preparing
    the groundwork to devour the entire nation. The attack on Azad represents a
    continuum of a growing menace that has expressed itself through attacks on
    Shamsur Rahman, Udichi, Ramna Botomool, Ahmadiyyas, Hindus and now the push
    for a Blasphemy Law. Where will it strike next?<br>
    <br>
    Azad is not the first author to fall foul of religious extremists. In 1994,
    in a startlingly similar attack, a man plunged a knife into the neck of
    Egyptian Nobel winner Naguib Mahfouz. The assailant was quickly identified
    as a sympathizer of the militant Islamic group al-Gama'a al-Islam. Mahfouz
    had been a target of the religious fanatics since the 1959 publication of
    his novel &quot;Awlad haratina (Children of Gebelawi )&quot;, in which key
    characters were modeled after historical religious figures. The attacker
    confessed before he was hanged that he had never read the book, but had been
    inspired by a sheikh's fatwa.<br>
    <br>
    Similar to today's Bangladesh, Egypt saw a rapid growth of religious
    parties, and an associated growth in violence in the 1990s. In 1992, the
    Gama'a al-Islamiyya launched violent attacks on the minority Coptic
    Christians. These attacks were linked with a campaign for Islamic rule in
    Egypt, resulting in pitched street battles with the police. This is a direct
    parallel to recent anti-Ahmadiyya agitations in Bangladesh and street
    warfare between members of Khatme Nabuwwot and the police. In Egypt, al-Gama'a
    soon upped the ante, assassinating secular intellectual Farag Foda and
    taking over the working class neighborhood of Imbaba and declared it an
    &quot;Islamic Republic.&quot; In December 1992, 14,000 Egyptian troops
    stormed and occupied Imbaba, putting an end to the &quot;Republic.&quot;
    Driven underground, Al-Gama'a redirected its attention towards high-profile
    terrorist attacks, massacring hundreds of foreign and local tourists between
    1993 and 1997.<br>
    <br>
    The attack on Naguib Mahfouz was a watershed, turning the majority of public
    opinion against the extremists of al-Gama'a and Islamic Brotherhood. When
    the Interior Minister was assigned the task of rooting out Muslim militants,
    Mahfouz told him from his hospital bed, &quot;You are leading a battle in
    defense of true Islam. This incident is an opportunity to ask God to make
    the police defeat terrorists and to plead for the country to be purified of
    this evil in defense of people, liberty and Islam.&quot;<br>
    Gamal Ghitani, editor of Akhbar al-Adab, wrote, &quot;This attack defames
    Islam and Arabs in a way that the worst of our enemies have not been able to
    inflict upon us.&quot; An Egyptian literary critic added, &quot;When the
    assailant stuck the knife in the neck of our Nobel Laureate, Naguib Mahfouz,
    it wasn't just an attack on our country's most prominent literary personage,
    but an assault on Egypt itself.&quot;<br>
    Most significantly, even religous leaders joined the outcry, with Grand
    Mufti Sheik Said Tantawi pronouncing, &quot;The sharia forbids a Muslim from
    pointing a weapon at his fellow Muslim, not to mention using this weapon in
    killing.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Faced with a decisive government crackdown, the militant groups slowly
    disintegrated. Today, an uneasy stability prevails in Egypt, but militant
    Islamic groups are no longer tolerated or supported by the government.
    Rather than silencing Naguib Mahfouz, the 1994 attack made him more
    determined. Suffering from nerve damage as a result of the attack, Mahfouz
    can no longer write. But each week he dictates his column to his friend
    Mohamed Salmawy. Since the incident, the government has also relaxed its
    unofficial ban on &quot;Awlad haratina.&quot; The book has now been
    serialized in newspapers, broadcast on radio and published in its entirety.
    Even the authorities at al-Azhar mosque-university recommended its
    publication so that it could be read and debated by people.<br>
    <br>
    Can we hope for a similar positive result from this tragic incident? Will
    the Bangladeshi people finally rise up in outrage and demand accountability
    from both the BNP and the AL? It is time to reign in those who play politics
    in the name of religion. Time to remove Jamaat ministers from their powerful
    posts, remove the ban on Ahmadiyya books, and strike down the proposed
    Blasphemy Act. To quote Safdar Hashmi, the Indian playwright murdered by
    government thugs in 1989, &quot;Halla Bol (Raise Hell)&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    And get results!</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">It may surprise many readers to know
  that Humayun Azad’s attackers wanted to slit his throat on February 27, 2004
  a la jihadi fashion.<span>&nbsp; </span>A <em>Murtaad </em>or apostate is a
  fare game.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once a person is labeled <em>Murtaad</em>,
  beheading that person is considered no crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>You see, the
  Islamists in Bangladesh declared Dr. Azad a Murtaad.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
  some thoughts on Dr. Azad’s plight in the hands of his assailants, please
  peruse the rest of my article.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">On February 27, 2004, about half a
  dozen would be assassin of Prof. Humayun Azad struck up a conversation with
  him inside the Bangla Academy compound where the annual Book Fair, <i>Boi Mela</i>,
  was going on.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was reported in many vernacular
  newspapers on February 28, 2004.<span>&nbsp; </span>At about 9:30 p.m. this
  group of assassins came out from Bangla Academy compound with Prof. Azad.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>They crossed the main road.<span>&nbsp; </span>The professor was
  talking to them for few minutes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three of the young men
  from the group entered the dimly lighted park while two followed Prof. Azad.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>All of a sudden, these two men started to strike Dr. Azad in the neck
  region.<span>&nbsp; </span>The place where this incident happened was not
  desolated.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a <i>Chatpati</i> vendor there.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Three eyewitnesses came forward that gave a detail account of the
  attack on Prof. Azad.<span>&nbsp; </span>The color photo of Dr. Azad taken at
  the hospital also revealed that most of the wounds due to hacking were
  localized in Prof. Azad’s head and neck.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it
  follows that the attackers perhaps wanted to slit the throat of Prof. Azad or
  behead him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, does that ring a warning bell?<span>&nbsp;
  </span>To me it does.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">In December 2001, some Islamists
  abducted the WSJ reporter Daniel Pearl in Karachi.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
  took him to a suburban house and kept him there for few more days.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>At the end, some Arab men came and slit the throat of Mr. Pearl a la
  jihadi style.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, why should one label the slitting of
  throat a jihadi style?<span>&nbsp; </span>Killing someone by slitting throat
  was the “proper way,” according to some dictums.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the
  Islamists wanted to silence Daniel Pearl, they could have easily done it by
  pumping bullet in his body.<span>&nbsp; </span>That would have been too clean.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>However, Pearl’s abductor had other motives.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
  wanted a messy killing, instead.<span>&nbsp; </span>The WSJ reporter admitted
  to his captors that he was a Jew.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, Pearl’s
  abductors wanted to kill him as per Arab style.<span>&nbsp; </span>According
  to news report, some Arab men came to the house where Daniel Pearl was kept
  hostage.<span>&nbsp; </span>They not only slit his throat cowardly but they
  recorded the ghastly act using a video camera.<span>&nbsp; </span>How
  disgusting!<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">Now let us analyze how the
  Bangladeshi freethinker and writer, Prof. Humayun Azad was attacked by his
  assailants.<span>&nbsp; </span>As per the description provided by roadside
  food vendors, one of the two attackers was a bearded person.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  two attackers were aiming Dr. Azad’s neck and head.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
  kept on striking his neck by sharp object, which the local papers reported as
  “chapati.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I was not familiar with the term.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Bangla standard dictionary did not contain that word.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
  it must a slang term.<span>&nbsp; </span>The correct Bangla word is “Dao”
  or “Da.”<span>&nbsp; </span>This sharp object is used in the village for
  slitting bamboos and coconut.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mind you, the attackers of
  Dr. Azad wanted to kill him by slitting his throat.<span>&nbsp; </span>They
  chose wrong place to fulfill their wish because the killing ground was crowded
  with Book Fair-goers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or else, they would have completed
  their job.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Bangladesh would have lost a freethinker,
  teacher, and writer.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">It is noteworthy here that only few
  weeks ago the Islamists held a meeting outside the national mosque, Bait-ul-Mukarram,
  a popular hangout of Mullahs and jihadis, where speakers have openly given
  death threats to Prof. Humayun Azad.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the Islamists,
  Maulana Delwar Hossain Saidee, had brazenly asked the Khaleda Zia
  Administration to ban Dr. Azad’s latest novel, “Pak Sar Zamin Sad Baad,”
  which poked fun at the Mullahs for siding with marauding Pakistani soldiers
  during our Liberation War.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Jamaati politicians were
  incensed hearing that Dr. Azad’s book pointed fingers at them for their
  involvement in intellectual killings in the fag end of 1971 war.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  Mullahs in Bangladesh has acquired this bad habit of labeling anyone a <i>Murtaad</i>
  or apostate who practices freethinking.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, Prof.
  Azad has already become a <i>Murtaad</i> in the eyes of hard-core Islamists.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>The punishment reserved for being a <i>Murtaad</i> is death by slitting
  throat or beheading.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Azad’s family told the reporters
  on February 29, 2004 that the family had received numerous death threats
  lately by phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>To add insult to the injury, a unanimous
  caller left a message at Dr. Azad’s phone on February 29 that next time the
  professor would not be so lucky.<span>&nbsp; </span>The chilling call points
  out the malevolence some people have for freethinkers in Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">Out of curiosity, I started to read
  vernacular and English newspapers published a day after Dr. Azad was attacked
  outside the Bangla Academy.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the newspapers that I read
  with the exception of one by the name Inquilab had denounced the vicious
  attack on Prof. Azad.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even though Inquilab has published
  the account of Dr. Azad’s maltreatment in the hands of the goons, the
  editorial staff had decided to remain reticent about the crime.<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">On the Net, I have seen some
  apologists of Maulana Saidee and Islamists who wrote that Dr. Azad’s
  incendiary writings should be blamed for this attack.<span>&nbsp; </span>These
  apologists of Jamaat and other fanatics in Bangladesh fail to see that free
  speech and freethinking is at stake in Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dark
  forces of 1971 want to silence the voices of freethinkers and pro-1971
  activists.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Humayun Azad, a noted Bangla linguist, has
  this unusual combination of a free thinker who often writes on 1971 freedom
  struggle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Naturally, the Mullahs ire was on him; therefore,
  he paid very dearly for his strong views.<span>&nbsp; </span>The assailants
  were aiming for his neck but due to the presence of fair-goers at the <i>Boi
  Mela</i>, his life was spared this time.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">On February 29, 2004, a day after
  the attack on Prof. Azad’s life, many protest meetings were staged.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>One of them was at the Dhaka University campus.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many
  politicians and retired teachers of the university took part in the meeting.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Many speakers have reiterated that there is no harm being a
  freethinker.<span>&nbsp; </span>No one should be singled out for being a
  freethinker.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most speakers have opined that what Bangladesh
  now needs urgently is the culture of freethinking.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
  traditional way of thinking, they opined, has led the country to a rut.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Islamism is rife in Bangladesh; it has paved the way for intolerance.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Under this backdrop, many Islamists want to silence the voice of
  freethinkers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vicious attack on Prof. Azad in which his
  assailants were going after his head is a grim reminder that the attackers
  were hell bent on decapitating Dr. Azad.<span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="verdana">A wave of protests in Bangladesh
  against this mindless brutality is a healthy sign.<span>&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
  one could wish that attack on Dr. Azad could trigger something big in
  Bangladesh.<span>&nbsp; </span>Democracy-loving free spirits of this nation of
  140 million will now rise up to rid the nation of all obscurantists who were
  helping Bangladesh to take a retrogressive journey to the abysses of darkness
  and despairs.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">How to contemplate on
  the vicious attack on Bangladeshi Professor Humayun Azad? Several minutes
  passed by. And several hours are gone. Only things come into mind are
  expletives detesting the maddening profanity engulfing our world, not to be
  written for the civil consumption.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">The horrific images
  published in several Bangladeshi newspapers, showing the blood soaked shirt,
  the deep wounds in his left jaw, dazedly walking, still conscious, but looked
  in pain.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Professor Humayun Azad
  is fighting for his life in Combined Military Hospital.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Professor Humayun Azad
  is unconscious; his blood seeped through his shirt, heartbeat unstable, for
  expressing views against communalism and fundamentalism’s resurrection.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">What is happening in
  Bangladesh?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">A nation born out from
  the oppression and colonialism filled past, fought a gruesome battle against
  sadistic subjugation, a proud nation for its national identity, its cultural
  vibrancy, is in the grip of recurrence of defeated forces of the past, “the
  collaborators” and their successors, long thought to be buried in the
  trash-bin of history.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Is communalism,
  religious fundamentalism the only responsible entity in degradation of moral
  and political fabric?</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Indeed there are
  resurgence of fundamentalists, the bearded and non-bearded mullahs, many of
  them are engaged in their conniving onslaught of grabbing power, like the
  others, in the name of almighty, the provocation on behalf of omnipotence,
  materializing the ultimate goal of eradicating the intrinsic tranquil nature
  of Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Power is corrupting.
  Power insinuates political leaders of all hues distort facts.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">The political culture
  in Bangladesh is puzzling. Some say, there is no veracity in contemporary
  political leaders. Their allegiance shifts, their ideals reshaped and
  repackaged for the suitability of their fierce desire. The major political
  parties, mainly the two, in the past had shook hands with diametrically
  opposite mullahs or corrupted and convicted leaders of the past for the sake
  of shoddy political gain.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">There are also
  allegations of embracing violence under the cloak of political agitation,
  hired guns, the goons and thugs have been nourished and fed, protected under
  official seal. Like changing sports team, these highly coveted bullies are
  lured from one political entity to another. The top guns, the pack of the
  brutes, are given grand choice: face extinction, or shift your allegiance.
  When the government changes, brutes hop or rot in the mortuary.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">There is the
  unmistakable linkage among the attack on Professor Humayun Azad, the exploding
  bombs in Romna Batamul and movie theaters, killings of liberal journalists,
  uncompromising political leaders, and activists in various parts, suppressions
  of minorities and ransacking or burning of their religious places. Not long
  ago the scorching of eleven Hindus of the same family stirred the soul of this
  nation. The same can be said on killings of people with opposing views, mostly
  occurred in the past governments.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Is the hacking of
  Professor Humayun Azad an isolated incident? In most likelihood: No. He was
  hacked for his intrepid views on freedom, the defeated force and
  fundamentalism.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">In the waning days of
  1971, along with the killings of hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis from
  all level, there was a systematic approach in eliminating the doctors,
  professors, engineers, writers, journalists and the overall intelligentsias.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">The terror, that
  almighty word of our time, acts as a forewarning: rescind from your
  unpalatable views on liberty, or you are the next.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">But the nation that has
  tasted the flavor of liberty, the victorious terror is never a certainty.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Courier New" size="3">Professor Humayun Azad,
  the 56-year-old Bengali teacher at Dhaka University, rested on the cold
  hospital bed, is struggling, and in enormous pain, but the shocking imagery of
  butchery may very well boost the struggle against terror and the twisty
  powerful “leaders” behind its cryptic design.</font></p>

          A lot of outrage against the attack on Dr. Humayun Azad two days back
          has been expressed in the Bangladeshi internet forums. Dr. Azad is a
          noted secular intellectual of Bangladesh who has written
          against&nbsp;the growing Islamic fanaticism in the country.&nbsp;He is
          in a&nbsp;critical condition at a hospital in Dhaka. His life could
          end anytime.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          A few days back, a renowned and respected leader of the country, Dr.
          Kamal Hossain, was&nbsp;attacked by armed thugs. Dr. Hossain also is
          against Islamization of the state of Bangladesh.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          Because of the severity of the condition of Dr. Azad, a lot of people
          have been expressing their anger and frustration with the prevailing
          lawlessness and Islamic hatred that&nbsp;the country has succumbed to.
          The attack on Dr. Hossain did not get as much attention, because he is
          not fighting for his life in a hospital bed.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          The question is, what is the point of all these anger and frustration?
          How long will these last? Dr. Azad will most likely die in a number of
          days. All these emotions will fade away, probably in a number of
          weeks. Life will go on in Bangladesh. The country will go deeper into
          the darkness of Islamic hatred.
        </div>
        <div>
          &nbsp;
        </div>
        <div>
          These emotions&nbsp;of anger and frustration&nbsp;are nothing but
          talks about the symptoms of a severe disease. The country really has
          very little force that&nbsp;is engaged in fighting this disease of
          Islamic fanaticism.

        <div>

          The government is a coalition of&nbsp;BNP and two professed Islamic
          parties. Much of the Bangladesh intelligentsia is corrupt to the core.
          They try to convince the world that BNP is not an Islamic fanatic
          party, that BNP is not Jamat-e-Islam. They try to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;the
          world that the 'bismillah' at the beginning of the constitution in no
          way degrades the non-Muslims of the land. They do not see any problem
          with&nbsp;having a 'state religion' (which obviously is Islam).

        <div>
          This attack on Dr. Azad&nbsp;has caused a lot of loud noise among
          Bangladeshis all over the world against Islamic fanaticism and against
          the government of Khaleda Zia. Much of this noise&nbsp;has&nbsp;come
          from Awami Leaguers.

          The fact of the matter is, when BNP wants to show its Islamic
          character by using 'bismillah' as a political slogan, Awami League
          wants to show its Islamic nature by using 'allahu akbar' as its
          political slogan.&nbsp;The fact of the matter is Sheikh Hasina tries
          to compete with Khaleda Zia on who can do the 'hajj' more number of
          times. The fact of the matter is, Islam is the overwhelming political
          force of the country. The genuine fighters of Islamic fanaticism in
          the country are very few&nbsp;and far between.

          Awami League had a record of being considerably secular during Mujib's
          time. That record has been tainted by the leadership of his daughter.
          Instead of asking people to keep religion out of politics,&nbsp;the
          party&nbsp;has engaged in appeasing Islamic fanaticism.

          What Bangladesh needs is a&nbsp;real fight against the disease of
          Islamic fanaticism. Crying about symptoms, such as the serious injury
          and possibly death of Dr. Azad,&nbsp;would not really help. People
          who&nbsp;genuinely feel that they are secular need to&nbsp;stop
          appeasing the so-called religious&nbsp;sentiments of the fanatics and
          the idiots.&nbsp;They need to fight the fanatics and educate the
          idiots.

        <div>
          The fact that the number of secular people are small is not the real
          problem, the real problem is their lack of conviction.&nbsp;The number
          could never grow without lasting conviction of the few. The country is
          badly&nbsp;in need of&nbsp;&quot;a few good men and women&quot; who
          would maintain and propagate respect for the human and citizenship
          rights of all its people.

    of late, Bangladesh is going through a very tough time, politically,
    socially, and economically speaking. However, the thing that scares me the
    most is the rise in Islamism.&nbsp; For example, only 3 days ago the fascist
    Islamist cadres have shown their Islamo-fascist face - they have jumped on
    Humayun Azad, a respected academician and writer, to kill him.&nbsp; The
    Islamo-fascists stabbed him repeatedly with crude sharp object to decapitate
    him.&nbsp; The self-proclaimed butchers of Islam enticed by the fiery speech
    of Jamaat stalwart Delwar Hossain Saidee who gave <i>fatwa</i> to declare
    writer Humayun Azad have decided to kill all the learned men of Bangladesh.&nbsp;
    The fundy Razakars got money from the Wahhabis to create second Afghanistan
    in South Asia.&nbsp; Bangladesh has become their playground under the
    patronage of government of fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami and Neo-Muslim
    League BNP.&nbsp; Uncle Sam is not watching them closely to monitor the
    Bangladeshi Islamic killers.&nbsp; The pentagon is too busy in Pakistan,
    Afghanistan and Iraq hunting down al-Qaeda soldiers and operatives of Osama
    bin Laden.</font></span></p>

    denounce us - the Bangladeshi freethinkers as Bangladeshi Zionists when we
    will criticize Islamic force for their barbarity against writer Humayun Azad.&nbsp;
    Then all of us will be under the similar threats of the Islamists.&nbsp; In
    fact, we are under the threats of the Islamo-fascists for quite some time in
    the Internet.&nbsp; Once the Islamists label someone as a Bangladeshi
    Zionist then what would be his or her fate.&nbsp; Islamists will single out
    that person; only thing they would need would be a fatwa from the likes of
    Delwar Hossain Saidee.&nbsp; Attempts will then be made on the life of that

  <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">As a Mukto Mona, I strongly condemn
  this savage act of brutality express oneness with the feeling og the wife of
  Azad,&nbsp;that some &quot;a-manush-o-mukto mona fundamentalists'' have done
  it. Actually who have done it,--- is yet to be ascertained by Police through
  proper investigation.But Prime Minister like many other serious incidents of
  the past, to shield the gang of Jamati-Islami-killers of her partner in
  politics power have declared that Awami League has done it!! This is the
  &quot;Action that was promised by Mayor State Minister for Home to the wife of
  Azad''.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">It is the duty of the State to
  unearth the identity of the killers,book send the involved to Justice.Instead
  of doing that she has given a long rope to the killers.It amounts to giving
  indulgence to killers.State failed measurably to save Humayun Azad from the
  attack of the killers but taken immediate instantenious actions to
  &quot;PROTECT'' the killers.It is nothing but rewarding the criminals. Of
  course it is the fundamental policy of the fundamentalist JOTE. They have
  rewarded the killers of the Father of the Nation Jail killing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">It was the bounden duty of the State
  to give physical&nbsp; protection to Prof.Humayun Azad. As the State failed
  measurably,criminals have won! Experts maintain,after an outrage in Parliament
  by Fundamentalist MP Sayeedi if our Intellegence would have come forward then
  such a serious incident would not have happened.Of course this is an ideal
  situation but in Jote regime it is a forgotten tune far cry! They are busy in
  annihalating opposition Awami League members minting money! Good governance
  has fled away by the behind doors due to the attack of the Jamati-killers.Now
  a host of killers god-fathers are rulling the Country!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">What is written in Law Books could
  only be quoted but that does not carry any meaning value unless the State
  means business. State is now a party to wrong doings all sort of the violation

  of Human Rights with impunity! If society,people cannot put their trust then
  it is taken that State's breathing has reached the state of a critical
  condition.It can be said,Prof. Humayun Azad means Bangladesh is passing the
  most critical condition of its existance in the operation theatre of
  iron-curtain CMH of Dhaka Cantonment! BONGO NETRI SHEIKH HASINA was not
  allowed to enter in the CMH.But why? Is it as because Prof.Humayun Azad is in
  a very very critical condition of his life death! We think while Prof. Azad is
  in coma Bangladesh is at coma! Jote must remember the killing of Dr.Milon,
  killed by the Killers of Ho.Mo.Ershad on 27th.November,1990.What happened
  next? Ershad had to declare his abdication from power on 4, December on
  6,December he had to step down! Jote's glass is full with blood.They should
  follow now the footprint of Ershad.Time is ripe.God's nemesis will befall on
  them at any time Insa Allah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">They are performing &quot;JAN KOBOCH
  DUTY'' for the last two years now they have started to kill our Bangali-Voice.
  Enough is enough.We know you have drawn the Road Map of killing.People will
  Block you in all fronts from all directions.Remember, it is not AZAD but with
  him our AZADI has been attacked.Bangalis fought against the Paki friends
  without arms.I want to remind that Bangalis Iman, courage to fight
  against&quot;al-badars-rajakers rapist criminal killers'' will bring total
  defeat to them soon.Bangalis would give a lesson to the killers protect AZADI
  with the spirit of &quot; Amar sonar Bangla ami tomay bhalobashi'' like
  Prof.Azad whole Bangalis(not the Bangladeshis) would burry the bloody
  followers of &quot;pak sar jomin sad bad''. AZAD'S SPIRIT OF PATRIOTISM WOULD
  PREVAIL.THREE CHEERS FOR AZAD.LONG LIVE AZAD WITH AZAD OUR AZADI,----&quot;AMADER

  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">It should not come as a
  surprise that expatriate Bangalees throughout the world are deeply saddened by
  the news of the attack Dr. Humayun Azad had sustained from some coward goons.&nbsp;
  In addition to the Bangalees, a number of humanist individuals of the world
  are deeply shocked and concerned about the condition of this renowned scholar.&nbsp;
  While the people of Bangladesh are very much aware of the perpetrators of the
  crimes, the Prime Minster Begum Khaleda Zia made a statement that needs some
  probing to unmask her paranoiac mindset.&nbsp; She blamed the major opposition
  party for the crime without even reading a single line from the detective
  branch of the police.&nbsp; As the head of the government, she should’ve
  absolute access to the information on the crimes committed against a notable
  thinker/philosopher like Professor Humayun Azad.&nbsp; So far, the law
  enforcement department has the slightest clue; thus, they haven’t revealed
  any information whatsoever as to who did the attack against this eminent
  person even though the conscious people have very clear guess about the
  criminals and their godfather.&nbsp; Nevertheless, concerned people of
  Bangladesh and intellectuals who follow the events in Bangladesh from outside
  world will pay heed to what the Prime Minister had said thus far.&nbsp; In
  this case, she shouldn’t make statements that are nothing but factoids at
  best.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">In any murder or attempted
  murder case, the investigators first investigate the motive of the criminals.&nbsp;
  If they don’t find first hand clue, then they take into account about the
  beneficiaries of the crime.&nbsp; The beneficiaries could be of
  political/economical/ideological nature depending the type of crimes.&nbsp;
  The losers/sufferers because of the crimes don’t automatically become the
  suspects.&nbsp; The beneficiaries could however be the prime suspects.&nbsp;
  In the case of the attempted murder of Dr. Humayun Azad, the losers are the
  pro-liberation forces/freethinkers/secularists of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The
  beneficiaries are the anti-liberation forces/fundamentalists/political
  Islamists of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The major opposition party Awami League led the
  war of liberation against the killer Pakistani regime and their
  fundamentalists/political Islamist partners in 1971.&nbsp; The writings of Dr.
  Humayun Azad enhance the strengths of the pro-liberation forces, who fought a
  war against the brutal pro-Pakistani forces under the elected government in
  exile formed by Awami League.&nbsp; Hence, the political party in question
  loses for the demise of writers/philosophers like Dr. Humayun Azad.&nbsp; Why
  on earth should their supporters attack him?&nbsp; It beats any logic, you
  see!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Prof. Azad’s writings
  certainly harm the anti-liberation forces politically and ideologically.&nbsp;
  They’re now sharing power with the party governed by the Prime Minister
  Begum Khaleda Zia.&nbsp; They’ve the power and means to talk against an
  educationist for writing a book even in parliament.&nbsp; Some of the
  fundamentalist/pro-Pakistani partners of the government expressed their
  outrage against Dr. Humayun Azad for writing a book titled “Pak Sar Zamin
  Sad Bad.”&nbsp; Many of these notorious political Islamists issued <i>Fatwas</i>
  to kill the intellectuals who differ with them on religious/political views in
  the past.&nbsp; Based on the rhetoric and past violent attitude of the
  fundamentalists/political Islamists, it is rather easy to conclude that
  they’ll be the beneficiaries if an eminent writer like Dr. Azad can’t
  write anymore.&nbsp; If he is killed, then their true color won’t be exposed
  any more.&nbsp; They can continue to be in power by keeping the present-day
  Bangalees in dark and confusion about them.&nbsp; They’ve achieved this
  mastery after their defeat in 1971. It is a survival tactics on their part.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Does the Prime Minister fail
  to analyze simple facts or is she going to rely on factoids to make up stories
  about who are behind the attack of Prof. Azad?&nbsp; It is possible though
  that she doesn’t want to embarrass her coalition partners especially
  Jamaat-i-Islami.&nbsp; However, she can hardly avoid the background
  information and the political motives of her coalition government.&nbsp; So
  far, it is observed that the deceptive policies are used randomly by the
  present government in suppressing information about the activities of the
  miscreants.&nbsp; This does not help improve the law and order situation in
  the country, which is out of kilter now.&nbsp; Instead, the perpetrators get
  encouraged.&nbsp; Come to think of it, a guess by the Prime Minister should be
  solidly based on some logic and facts.&nbsp; Unfortunately, truth is seldom
  seen to come out of the present administration because it is buried with
  prevarications.&nbsp; After all, the Prime Minister and her government
  aren’t truthful about the history of our liberation war.&nbsp; They are good
  at manufacturing fibs about who gave the clarion call for our freedom
  movement.&nbsp; Lately, textbooks have been re-written in Bangladesh to favor
  the PMs pet view.&nbsp; This doctoring of books will have their adverse
  effect; the nation will produce some confused citizens in years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">In summary, making fib,
  prevarication, etc., has become a pastime of our present day Prime Minister of
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; Evading truth to settle some old score with her opponent,
  ex-PM Sheikh Hasina, keeps her ever busy.&nbsp; The PM won’t admit in public
  that kowtowing the Islamists to win the election has its pitfall.&nbsp; Very
  soon, Bangladesh’s citizens are going to be disenchanted with her fib-making
  exercises.&nbsp; When push comes to shove, the people of Bangladesh will dump
  her and the Islamists in favor of a secular party.&nbsp; I hear the rumblings
  in the distant horizon.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
