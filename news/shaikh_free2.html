  And many of the forums and sites like FFI have played a stellar role of

  <br>
  My only hope is.. I will not hear a news like.. Some Mohammadonian barbarian 
  took away the life Dr Younis Sheikh in that country that is called LAND OF

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  For Immediate Release <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Blasphemy Doctor Released from Death Row <br>
                  <br>
                  The International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) announced 
                  today that Dr Younus Shaikh, who had languished in gaol in 
                  Pakistan since October 2000 under sentence of death for 
                  blasphemy, has been acquitted and freed after an appeal and 
                  retrial. <br>
                  <br>
                  In an international campaign led by IHEU, Dr Shaikh was 
                  declared a Prisoner of Conscience by Amnesty International, 
                  and thousands of people worldwide lobbied their politicians 
                  and the Government of Pakistan on his behalf. <br>
                  <br>
                  The trial of Dr Shaikh, held throughout the Summer of 2001, 
                  took place in a hostile courtroom packed with Islamic 
                  fundamentalists. The final two <br>
                  sessions were held in-camera with gun-toting Pakistani Taliban 
                  waiting <br>
                  outside. In October 2003, the Appeal Court ordered a retrial 
                  at which, <br>
                  following threats by fundamentalists to his lawyers and their 
                  families, Dr <br>
                  Shaikh courageously pleaded his own case <br>
                  <br>
                  Speaking from London today, Dr Shaikh explained: <br>
                  “The judge accepted my legal arguments and found the charges 
                  against me to be baseless. My accusers, two Mullahs and some 
                  Islamist students, had lied.” He described his ordeal as: 
                  “Islamic terrorism through the abuse of law and the state 
                  apparatus.” <br>
                  <br>
                  IHEU condemns the abuse, false imprisonment and mistreatment 
                  of this <br>
                  courageous and innocent man forced to spend over three years 
                  in prison, two in the death cell in solitary confinement. <br>
                  <br>
                  Pakistan’s infamous blasphemy laws are widely abused to make 
                  false <br>
                  accusations against both Muslims and members of religious 
                  minorities, such <br>
                  as Christians and Ahmadis, as well as innocent business rivals 
                  and political <br>
                  opponents. Those accused under the blasphemy laws are 
                  immediately imprisoned with no effective right to bail. If 
                  pronounced guilty, they face a mandatory death sentence. It is 
                  estimated that over 100 victims of Pakistan’s medieval 
                  blasphemy laws are currently in prison either awaiting trial 
                  or already under sentence of death. <br>
                  <br>
                  The international Humanist community calls upon President 
                  Parvez Musharraf and the Pakistani Parliament to immediately 
                  abolish these profoundly unjust laws – an ugly stain on the 
                  reputation of the nation and people of Pakistan. <br>

                  Background to IHEU Press Release 23 Jan 2004 <br>
                  <br>
                  Blasphemy Doctor, Younus Shaikh released from Death Row <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Dr Shaikh <br>
                  Mohammed Younus Shaikh was born in Chishtian, Pakistan on 30th 
                  May 1952. After High School he studied medicine in Multan 
                  where he qualified as a doctor of medicine, and did 
                  post-graduate studies in Dublin and London. He worked as a 
                  trainee surgeon in the United Kingdom from 1981 until 1988. He 
                  returned to Pakistan where he taught at a medical college in 
                  Islamabad. <br>
                  <br>
                  As a Human Rights activist in Pakistan he attracted the 
                  attention of the <br>
                  Islamic fundamentalists. He took part in the Pakistan-India 
                  Forum for Peace and Democracy, and was a member of the South 
                  Asian Fraternity, South Asian Union and the Human Rights 
                  Commission of Pakistan. In 1990 he started a Humanist 
                  organisation called “The Enlightenment”, inspired by the ideas 
                  of the European Enlightenment and Renaissance. <br>
                  <br>
                  Kashmir <br>
                  <br>
                  At a meeting of the South Asian Union on 1st October 2000, 
                  Younus Shaikh <br>
                  suggested that in the interest of the people of Kashmir, the 
                  line of control <br>
                  between the Indian and Pakistani forces should become the 
                  international <br>
                  border. This clearly offended a Pakistani officer who 
                  responded by saying to Dr Shaikh that “I will crush the heads 
                  of those that talk like this”. <br>
                  <br>
                  On 3rd October Dr Shaikh was suspended by the college without 
                  explanation. It transpired that an employee of the Pakistani 
                  Foreign Office, who was also one of Dr Shaikh’s students, had 
                  complained to a cleric, saying that on 2nd October in a 
                  lecture between 12:00 noon and 12:40pm, the doctor had made 
                  blasphemous remarks about the Prophet of Islam. The cleric 
                  filed a complaint with the police, and Younus Shaikh was 
                  arrested on the evening of 4th October and charged with 
                  blasphemy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Trial and Acquittal <br>
                  <br>
                  Those accused of blasphemy under Article 295/c of the Pakistan 
                  Legal Code are unable to obtain bail but are held in custody 
                  awaiting trial. On 18th August 2001, after a trial lasting 
                  several months during which it was <br>
                  established that the alleged events had never taken place, Dr 
                  Shaikh was <br>
                  nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death. Sadly, in 
                  Pakistan, such <br>
                  injustices are not uncommon in cases of alleged blasphemy. <br>
                  <br>
                  For the next two years, Dr Shaikh was held in solitary 
                  confinement in a <br>
                  death cell in the Central Gaol in Rawalpindi. He appealed to 
                  the High Court, <br>
                  but on 15th July 2002 the two appeal judges failed to agree 
                  and the case was referred to a senior judge for a final 
                  decision. <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A delay of more than a year then ensued before the referee 
                  took up the case. On October 9th 2003, this judge finally 
                  decided that the original judgement was unsound but instead of 
                  acquitting Dr Shaikh, remanded the case back to a lower court 
                  for retrial. <br>
                  <br>
                  The retrial was held over three sessions in November 2003. In 
                  the light of <br>
                  the harassment and intimidation suffered by his lawyers at the 
                  earlier <br>
                  hearings, and much against the advice of the judge, his 
                  colleagues, his <br>
                  family and the members of the diplomatic community present in 
                  court, Dr <br>
                  Shaikh decided this time to conduct his own defence. The 
                  prosecuting counsel tried to exploit the religious feelings of 
                  the court but Dr Shaikh confined his defence to legal 
                  arguments and was finally acquitted on 21st November. He tells 
                  us that he was inspired by the defence speech of Sir Thomas 
                  More in “A Man for All Seasons”. Fortunately the outcome this 
                  time was different. <br>
                  <br>
                  Escape to Freedom <br>
                  <br>
                  Dr Shaikh was released from the gaol in great secrecy, was 
                  offered, but <br>
                  refused, a police bodyguard, and went into hiding for several 
                  weeks, meeting family and friends and even participating, 
                  incognito, in a debate on Human Rights, while making 
                  arrangements to leave the country. He has now left Pakistan 
                  for Europe. <br>
                  <br>
                  Many victims of the Pakistani blasphemy laws have failed to 
                  survive prison <br>
                  while a number of those tried and acquitted have been murdered 
                  following <br>
                  their release. As recently as July 2002, Mohammed Yousaf was 
                  shot dead <br>
                  inside the Central Gaol in Lahore while awaiting his appeal. 
                  On 7th February 2003, Mushtaq Zafar, a 55 year-old man accused 
                  of blasphemy was shot dead on his way home from the High 
                  Court. And in June 2003, a woman who had accused the police of 
                  a gang rape was later charged with blasphemy and murdered even 
                  before her trial began. <br>
                  <br>
                  Even the legal profession are not immune from attack. Defence 
                  lawyers have been intimidated by fundamentalists and even a 
                  High Court judge was murdered after acquitting an accused. <br>
                  <br>
                  Last week, one of Dr Shaikh’s supporters, speaking anonymously 
                  from <br>
                  Islamabad said: <br>
                  <br>
                  “We may draw some satisfaction and may even feel like 
                  celebrating that our efforts in pursuing this case led to the 
                  acquittal of Dr. Sheikh, but let's <br>
                  not forget that as long as the Blasphemy law is on the statute 
                  book, it will <br>
                  continue to be misused. At this very moment there are several 
                  innocent <br>
                  people, victims of this black law, languishing in various 
                  jails and lock-ups <br>
                  of the country awaiting an uncertain future. And these victims 
                  may not be as fortunate as Dr. Sheikh was. Dr. Sheikh had a 
                  circle of committed friends inside and outside the country.”
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  “It is also a sad reflection on the state and society of 
                  Pakistan that even <br>
                  when individuals are exonerated by law of any guilt, they are 
                  forced to flee <br>
                  the country for their safety. The state or society is unable 
                  or unwilling to <br>
                  provide them protection. Dr. Sheikh was not at all eager to 
                  leave the <br>
                  country. If he had a choice he would have stayed with his 
                  family <br>
                  and friends. I could see his reluctance to leave the country 
                  written large <br>
                  on his face when I accompanied him to the airport.” <br>
                  <br>
                  “The bottom line is that we must continue our campaign until 
                  this <br>
                  draconian law, along with similar other medieval laws, is 
                  undone or at least <br>
                  modified to save the innocent people from its abuse.” <br>

  Subject: TUG OF WAR. </p>
  <pre>TUG OF WAR.

(Dori Tana-Tani).


This is what it is called, Tug Of War. Or we may call it, Rope-Pulling. In 
this game two competing groups pull a thick strong rope towards opposite 
directions. The “biggest, fattest, huge tummy’ed” person tie the end of the 
rope around his waist, and the rest pull it. Winner is the party who can 
pull the rope towards themselves.

It used to be played in Bengal-villages. Now it is being played in 
international arena, between us and them. We are pulling the rope towards 
humanity, they are pulling it towards theocracy. In Bengal-villages it is 
entertainment, here it is a deadly encounter. Once the game is over, history 
will bury one of us in its huge stomach, forever.

Either us, or them. So we had to bite a death-bite, we can’t afford to 
loose. And they did it too, they can’t afford to loose either! For us it is 
the question of saving humanity from that poisonous snake. For them it is 
the vital question of their existence.

Win or die. For both of us.

They gave us a blow in Pakistan by sentencing stoning-to-death to Zafran 
Bibi. We defeated them by saving her with a terrific international scream. 
They emerged in BD and defeated us by placing two killers as ministers in 
the parliament. We rushed to Islamabad and defeated them by a new Law of 
women deciding their own marriage. They went to NWFP (Pakistan) and defeated 
us by passing a law that no women be attended by male-technicians for 
ultrasound and ECG. We showed up in Bhurghata of Barisal (23 March 2003) and 
kicked away the Islamic State-ists. They went to Indonesia and smashed us by 
passing a law giving fathers the right to marry their daughters against the 
girls’ will. We went to Nigeria and won in case of Amina Kurami. They went 
to Iran and defeated us by killing freethinkers and journalists. We came 
back to Pakistan and snatched Dr. Yunus Shaikh from their deadly claw.


A global drama is going on in full force. One thing is clear. Our means is 
peaceful. Theirs is violence.


Who will win?

Thanks.
