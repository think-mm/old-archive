	<img height="32" alt="B" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/dropcap/b.gif" width="30" align="left" border="0">efore 
	dawn one morning this past November in Bagmara, a village in northwestern 
	Bangladesh, six puffy-eyed men gathered beneath a cracked-mud stairwell to 
	describe a man they consider their leader, a former schoolteacher called 
	Bangla Bhai. The quiet was broken now and then by donkey carts clattering 
	past, as village women, seated on the backs of the carts, were taken to the 
	market. The women wore makeshift burkas -- black, white, canary yellow -- 
	and kept their heads down, and this, the men explained, was Bangla Bhai's 
	doing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Last spring, Bangla Bhai, whose 
	followers probably number around 10,000, decided to try an Islamist 
	revolution in several provinces of Bangladesh that border on India. His name 
	means ''Bangladeshi brother.'' (At one point he said his real name was 
	Azizur Rahman and more recently claimed it was Siddiqul Islam.) He has said 
	that he acquired this nom de guerre while waging jihad in Afghanistan and 
	that he was now going to bring about the Talibanization of his part of 
	Bangladesh. Men were to grow beards, women to wear burkas. This was all 
	rather new to the area, which was religiously diverse. But Jagrata Muslim 
	Janata Bangladesh, as Bangla Bhai's group is called (the name means Awakened 
	Muslim Masses of Bangladesh), was determined and violent and seemed to have 
	enough lightly armed adherents to make its rule stick. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because he swore his main enemy was 
	a somewhat derelict but still dangerous group of leftist marauders known as 
	the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, Bangla Bhai gained the support of the 
	local police -- until the central government, worried that Bangla Bhai's 
	band might be getting out of control, ordered his arrest in late May. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''There used to be chaos and 
	confusion here,'' Siddiq-ul-Rahman, one of Bangla Bhai's senior lieutenants, 
	said through an interpreter that morning in Bagmara. The sun was coming up 
	and a crowd was gathering. Siddiq-ul-Rahman boasted that police officers 
	attend Bangla Bhai's meetings armed and in uniform. The Bangladeshi 
	government's arrest warrant doesn't seem to have made much difference, 
	although for now Bangla Bhai refrains from public appearances. The 
	government is far away in Dhaka, and is in any case divided on precisely 
	this question of how much Islam and politics should mix. Meanwhile, Bangla 
	Bhai and the type of religious violence he practices are filling the power 
	vacuum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladeshi politics have never 
	strayed far from violence. During the war for independence from Pakistan, in 
	1971, three million people died in nine months. Thuggery has been a 
	consistent feature of political life since then and is increasingly so 
	today. This has made it difficult to get an accurate picture of phenomena 
	like Bangla Bhai. Under the current government, which has been in power 
	since 2001 and includes two avowedly Islamist parties, journalists are 
	frequently imprisoned. Last year, three were killed while reporting on 
	corruption and the rise of militant Islam. Moreover, 80 percent of 
	Bangladeshis live in villages that can be hard to reach and are under the 
	tight control of local politicians. Foreign journalists in Bangladesh are 
	followed by intelligence agents; people that reporters interview are 
	questioned afterward. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nonetheless, it is possible to 
	travel through Bangladesh and observe the increased political and religious 
	repression in everyday life, and to verify the simple remark by one 
	journalist there: ''We are losing our freedom.'' The global war on terror is 
	aimed at making the rise of regimes like that of the Taliban impossible, but 
	in Bangladesh, the trend could be going the other way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<img alt="I" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/i.gif" align="left">n 
	Bangladesh, ''Islam is becoming the legitimizing political discourse,'' 
	according to C. Christine Fair, a South Asia specialist at the United States 
	Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan, federally financed policy group in 
	Washington. ''Once you don that religious mantle, who can criticize you? We 
	see this in Pakistan as well, where very few people are brave enough to take 
	the Islamists on. Now this is happening in Bangladesh.'' The region, Fair 
	added, has become a haven where jihadis can move easily and have access to a 
	friendly infrastructure that allows them to regroup and train. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another close observer of 
	Bangladeshi politics, Ali Dayan Hasan of Human Rights Watch, told me 
	recently: ''The practical effect of politics along religious lines is that 
	you start to accept a religious identity and reject every other. It's 
	absolutely crucial to understand that this is happening in Bangladesh right 
	now.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was not supposed to be the fate 
	of Bangladesh, which fought its way to independence 34 years ago. While its 
	population of 141 million is 83 percent Muslim, the nation was founded on 
	the principle of secularism, which in Bangladesh essentially means religious 
	tolerance. After the guiding figure of independence, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
	was assassinated in 1975, military leaders, seeking legitimacy, allowed a 
	return of Islam to politics. With the return of fair elections in 1991, 
	power became precariously divided among four parties: the right-leaning 
	Bangladesh National Party (B.N.P.), the mildly leftist Awami League, the 
	Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami and the conservative Jatiya. The two leading 
	parties are led by women: the B.N.P. by the current prime minister, Khaleda 
	Zia, widow of the party's murdered founder; the Awami League by Zia's 
	predecessor as prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wazed, herself the daughter of 
	the assassinated founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Zia and Sheikh Hasina, as she is 
	known, have a legendary antipathy toward each other. Each of their parties 
	regularly accuses the other of illegal acts. When Sheikh Hasina very 
	narrowly escaped assassination last August, B.N.P. activists all but accused 
	her of staging the attack in order to acquire political advantage. Zia's 
	government has been unable to identify the assassins -- who lobbed grenades 
	into a party rally, killing at least 20 and wounding hundreds -- and Sheikh 
	Hasina has refused even to discuss the investigation with the prime 
	minister, saying: ''With whom should I meet? With the killers?'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The political breach between those 
	two parties is being filled primarily by Jamaat-e-Islami, which agitated 
	against independence in 1971 and remains close to Pakistan. The group was 
	banned after independence for its role in the war but has slowly worked its 
	way back to political legitimacy. The party itself has not changed much -- 
	it was always socially conservative and unafraid of violence. The political 
	context, however, has changed enough to give it greater power. Since 2001, 
	Jamaat-e-Islami has been a crucial part of a governing coalition dominated 
	by the B.N.P. The two parties have ties dating to the late 1970's, but it is 
	only since 2001 that a politically aggressive form of Islam has found, for 
	the first time since independence, a strong place at the top of Bangladeshi 
	politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has found a corresponding 
	position at the bottom of Bangladeshi politics as well, in the social scrum 
	that produces figures like Bangla Bhai. (Opposition politicians have linked 
	Bangla Bhai to Jamaat-e-Islami, a tie that Jamaat and Bangla Bhai have both 
	denied.) The border provinces have, since independence, harbored a 
	proliferation of armed groups that either Bangladesh, India, Myanmar or 
	Pakistan, or some region or faction in one of those countries, has been 
	willing to support for its own political reasons. By the early 1990's 
	Islamist groups began appearing, mainly at the periphery of the jihad 
	centered on Afghanistan. The most important of these has been the 
	Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji), which has been associated with Fazlul 
	Rahman, who signed Osama bin Laden's famous declaration in 1998 endorsing 
	international, coordinated jihad -- the document that introduced Al Qaeda to 
	the larger world. But Bangla Bhai's group and others have since emerged and 
	are making their bids for power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''Bangladesh is becoming 
	increasingly important to groups like Al Qaeda because it's been off 
	everyone's radar screen,'' says Zachary Abuza, the author of ''Militant 
	Islam in Southeast Asia'' and a professor of political science at Simmons 
	College in Boston. ''Al Qaeda is going to have to figure out where they can 
	regroup, where they have the physical capability to assemble and train, and 
	Bangladesh is one of these key places.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Six years ago, Huji chose its first 
	prominent target: Shamsur Rahman, who is Bangladesh's leading poet. 
	Recently, at his home in Dhaka, Rahman began telling me the story of the 
	attack as he pulled a sheaf of papers from a pigeonhole in his writing desk, 
	on which sat a bottle of black-currant soda and a copy of Dante's 
	''Inferno.'' Above the desk hung an ink sketch of the Nobel Prize-winning 
	Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore, as well as a yellowing photograph of 
	Rahman's father. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rahman, who is 75, is birdlike and 
	wears his hair in a fluffy white pageboy. Most of his poems are love poems, 
	but some address the rise of militant Islam in his country. ''I am not 
	against religion,'' he said, smiling wryly. ''I am against fanaticism.'' He 
	reached for his mug of hot water. It was the holy month of Ramadan, and 
	Rahman's family had just broken the day's fast. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Downstairs, four policemen were 
	eating a meal prepared by Rahman's daughter-in-law Tia. Rahman has lived 
	under police protection since Jan. 18, 1999, when three young men appeared 
	at his house and asked for a poem. Tia refused to let them in. The poet was 
	resting, she said. But the men begged for just a minute of his time, so Tia 
	obliged. Immediately one of the men ran upstairs and tried to chop Rahman's 
	neck with an ax. ''He tried to cut my head off, but my wife took me in her 
	arms and my daughter-in-law too,'' Rahman recounted. The two women fended 
	off the blows until the neighbors, hearing their screams, rushed into the 
	house and caught the attackers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rahman gestured toward the women 
	standing in the doorway. Tia looked exhausted. The hair around her face was 
	damp from cooking. Rahman's wife, Zahora, not more than four feet tall, held 
	her diminutive hands in front of her and smiled. (She understands English 
	but cannot speak it.) Rahman pointed out the shiny scar on her arm. Zahora 
	patted her husband and took his empty mug to the kitchen. ''They wanted my 
	head, not a poem,'' he said. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The attack led to the arrest of 44 
	members of Huji. Two men, a Pakistani and a South African, claimed they had 
	been sent to Bangladesh by Osama bin Laden with more than $300,000, which 
	they distributed among 421 madrassas, or private religious schools. 
	According to Gowher Rizvi, director of the Ash Institute for Democratic 
	Governance and Innovation at Harvard and a lecturer in public policy, bin 
	Laden's reputed donation is ''a pittance'' compared with the millions that 
	Saudi charities have contributed to many of Bangladesh's estimated 64,000 
	madrassas, most of which serve only a single village or two. Money of this 
	kind is especially important because Bangladesh is one of the poorest 
	countries in the world. Out of 177 countries on the United Nations' Human 
	Development Index, Bangladesh is ranked 138, just above Sudan. The recent 
	tsunami that devastated its neighbors hardly touched it -- a rare bit of 
	good luck for the country, as most catastrophes seem somehow to claim their 
	victims in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Bangla Bhai's patch of 
	northwestern Bangladesh, poverty is so pervasive that, for many children in 
	the region, privately subsidized madrassas are the only educational option. 
	For the past several years especially, money from Persian Gulf states has 
	strengthened them even more. Most follow a form of the Deobandi Islam taught 
	in the 1950's by the intellectual and activist Maulana Abul Ala Maududi, who 
	was born in India in 1903 and defined Muslim politics in opposition to 
	Indian nationalism. While Maududi's original agenda was reformist, the 
	Deobandi model is now better known from the madrassas of Pakistan, where it 
	gave rise to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Whether Maududi intended it or not, 
	his teachings have become synonymous with radical Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In November, in a shop in the 
	Bagmara bazaar not far from where Bangla Bhai used to hold his meetings, two 
	young men sat waiting to tell their stories about the cruelty and repression 
	of Bangla Bhai's movement. Everyone here wanted to talk about this, they 
	said, but were afraid of the consequences. Several days earlier, Bangla 
	Bhai's cadres had beaten a university student caught smoking cigarettes, 
	another banned act. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''We weren't allowed to sell 
	these,'' said one of the men, a 20-year-old shopkeeper, holding up a pack of 
	Player's Gold Leaf he kept on a low shelf.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His friend, a thickset man in a 
	white kurta -- a long-sleeved shirt extending below the waist -- sat on a 
	carton next to the counter, with a blue mobile phone in his hand. He played 
	with the phone distractedly as he described the announcements Bangla Bhai's 
	men had made, beginning last summer, over the loudspeaker, demanding that 
	people come watch public punishments. He told me that over the past months 
	he himself had seen more than 50 men hanged upside down by their feet from 
	bamboo scaffolding and beaten with hammers, iron rods and the field-hockey 
	sticks that are commonly used in Bangladesh as weapons. He winced for a 
	second recalling these tortures, and then his fleshy face lost all 
	expression. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''In this place people live in 
	fear,'' the shopkeeper said. ''They still punish people. If anyone is not 
	keeping Ramadan, even if it's a sick man and he's eating in a restaurant, 
	they treat them badly.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The thickset man scanned the street 
	over his shoulder and added, shaking his head, ''They wanted the regime of 
	the Taliban here.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Taskforce against Torture, a 
	Bangladeshi human rights organization founded three years ago, has recorded 
	more than 500 cases of people being intimidated and tortured by Bangla Bhai 
	and his men. One of them is Abdul Quddus Rajon, a postmaster from Shafiqpur, 
	a village near Bagmara. He is 42 and comes from a wealthy family of moderate 
	Muslims. Rajon was abducted early last May when two men in green headbands 
	showed up at the post office on a motorbike. They forced him onto the bike 
	and demanded his brother's phone number. Abdul Kayyam Badshah, Rajon's 
	brother and the leader of a banned Communist Party, was wanted by the 
	government and being pursued by Bangla Bhai's men. Rajon refused to give 
	them the number, so they took his mobile phone and drove him to one of 
	Bangla Bhai's camps. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rajon told me when I met him that he 
	was held with 15 other men in two rooms. ''For four days they tortured me,'' 
	he recounted. Every morning, his captors, who Rajon said were not more than 
	teenagers, took him to a cell and beat him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangla Bhai's men demanded 100,000 
	taka for his release, about $1,600. Rajon eventually agreed to pay. Before 
	his release, he said, his captors tried to intimidate him into becoming more 
	observant. ''They took me in front of a mosque and told me to promise I 
	would keep my beard and pray five times a day, and to never tell anything 
	about Bangla Bhai's camp,'' he said. ''They wore beards and long kurtas like 
	religious men, but that was the only way in which they were religious.'' He 
	pulled up the cuffs of his khakis to reveal deep black gashes in his shins.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''Eleven days later,'' he said, 
	''they caught my brother.'' At noon on May 19, Rajon was awakened by a 
	loudspeaker. Bangla Bhai's men were announcing that his brother's trial 
	would start the next day and he would be sentenced to death. ''I tried to 
	contact the state minister and the superintendent of police by telephone,'' 
	Rajon said. ''Because if Badshah was accused, he should be tried according 
	to the laws of the land. But they wouldn't talk to me.'' (According to The 
	Daily Star, Bangladesh's leading English-language newspaper, the local 
	government has been accused of colluding with Bangla Bhai.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next morning, Badshah was found 
	hanged by his feet from a tree near a police station. He had been beaten to 
	death. Rajon first heard about it through whispering in the village. ''A 
	policeman was wandering around asking people if they were glad my brother 
	was dead,'' he said. In the village and the surrounding districts, Bangla 
	Bhai's spate of killings and torture continued for another month. One man 
	was dismembered. Another, according to local journalists and villagers who 
	told me they heard him, had a microphone held to his mouth while he was 
	tortured so that the entire village could listen to his screams. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<img alt="C" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/c.gif" align="left">ommunists 
	are just one target of Islamic militants in Bangladesh. Most attacks have 
	been carried out against either members of religious minorities -- Hindus, 
	Christians and Buddhists -- or moderate Muslims considered out of step with 
	the doctrines espoused at the militant madrassas. International groups like 
	Human Rights Watch cannot gather information freely enough to be certain of 
	the scope of the problem. Yet anecdotal evidence is abundant. In Bangladesh, 
	as part of the militant Islamists' agenda, religious minorities are coming 
	under a new wave of attacks. One of the most vulnerable communities is that 
	of the Ahmadiyya, a sect of some 100,000 Muslims who believe that Muhammad 
	was not the last prophet. (The Ahmadiyya are the subject of a Human Rights 
	Watch report to be published next month.) In Pakistan, the Ahmadiyya have 
	been declared infidels and many have been killed. In Bangladesh, religious 
	hardliners have burned mosques and books and pressured the government to 
	declare the sect non-Muslim. Last year, the government agreed to ban 
	Ahmadiyya literature; earlier this month, however, Bangladesh's high court 
	stayed the ban pending further consideration by the court. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But those who oppose the Ahmadiyya 
	are not giving up. At a recent rally in Dhaka, 10,000 protesters gathered 
	outside an Ahmadiyya mosque as one Islamic leader intoned from a parade 
	float, ''Bangladesh's Muslims cast their vote to elect the current 
	government, and the current government is not paying any heed.'' Police 
	officers in riot gear tightened their formation protecting the mosque. 
	''Beware, we will throw you out of office if you do not meet our demands,'' 
	he said. ''No one will be able to stop the forward march of the soldiers of 
	Islam in Bangladesh.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Ahmadiyya are hardly the only 
	group at risk. ''For the Hindus, the last couple of years have been 
	disastrous,'' says Ali Dayan Hasan of Human Rights Watch. ''There are 
	substantial elements within the society and government itself that are 
	advancing the idea that Hindus need to be expelled.'' On the ground, attacks 
	against Hindus include beatings and rapes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''Minority communities in the 
	country are feeling less safe,'' said Govind Acharya, Amnesty 
	International's country specialist for Bangladesh. ''The Hindus, the 
	Ahmadiyya and the tribals in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are all leaving. 
	This demographic shift is the most problematic for the identity and the 
	future of the country.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The permissiveness of at least some 
	within the Bangladeshi government and the police in allowing violent groups 
	like Bangla Bhai's to pursue their agendas has only increased the political 
	legitimacy of such groups. Mohammad Selimullah, the leader of a militant 
	Islamist group based across Bangladesh's eastern border in Myanmar, was 
	arrested in Chittagong early in 2001, and he admitted in court that more 
	than 500 jihadis had been training under him in Bangladesh. On his computer, 
	intelligence sources found photographs to be sent to donors showing Islamic 
	soldiers at rest and at attention, armed with AK-47's and wearing shiny new 
	boots. Selimullah said that his group received weapons from supporters in 
	Libya and Saudi Arabia, among others. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Last spring in Chittagong, 10 
	truckloads of weapons -- the largest arms seizure in Bangladesh's history -- 
	were captured by the police as they were being unloaded from trawlers. The 
	tip-off most likely came from Indian intelligence, which monitors the arms 
	being sent to Islamist separatist groups in India's northeast. Haroon Habib, 
	a leading journalist in the region, has written that a leader of the 
	government's local Islamist coalition was helping to hide the weapons.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Several months later, under 
	increased pressure from the European Union and the United States to crack 
	down on terror, Bangladeshi security forces raided two camps in the Ukhia 
	area belonging to Huji. Local journalists say that both camps, which were 
	not far from Chittagong, have now been destroyed, but no one can get close 
	enough to be sure. What is certain is that the attack didn't drive the 
	militants out of the region. Four months ago, five more members of Huji were 
	arrested in Chittagong. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this environment, Bangladesh's 
	radical leaders have ratcheted up their ambitions. Responding to the 
	American invasion of Afghanistan, supporters of the Islamic Oikya Jote (I.O.J.), 
	the most radical party in the governing coalition and a junior partner to 
	the Jamaat-e-Islami, chanted in the streets of Chittagong and Dhaka, ''Amra 
	sobai hobo Taliban, Bangla hobe Afghanistan,'' which roughly translates to 
	''We will be the Taliban, and Bangladesh will be Afghanistan.'' </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The I.O.J. is considered a 
	legitimate voice within Bangladeshi politics. The I.O.J.'s chairman, Mufti 
	Fazlul Haque Amini, who has served as a member of Parliament for the past 
	three years, says he believes that secular law has failed Bangladesh and 
	that it's time to implement Sharia, the legal code of Islam. During our two 
	hourlong meetings, the mufti -- a welcoming and relatively open man with a 
	salt-and-pepper beard and teeth dyed red from chewing betel -- asked if he 
	could take photographs and pass them along to the local press to show his 
	constituents that he is so powerful the Western press now comes to him.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mufti presides over his 
	father-in-law's mosque and madrassa, Jamiat-Qurania-Arabia, in Dhaka, where 
	the traffic caused by 600,000 bicycle rickshaws, more than in any other city 
	in the world, is so intense that it can take hours to travel fewer than 10 
	miles from Louis Kahn's ethereal Parliament -- a relic of a more hopeful 
	period in Bangladesh's democracy -- to the warren of lanes in the old part 
	of town where the mufti is based. At the mosque, he almost overfills the 
	armchair in which he stations himself. He admits that as an Islamic state, 
	Bangladesh still has far to go. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">''As we are Muslim, naturally we 
	want Bangladesh to be an Islamic state and under Islamic law,'' the mufti 
	said. Amini is the author of books in Arabic, Bangla and Urdu. (He learned 
	Urdu while completing graduate work in a madrassa in Karachi, Pakistan.) He 
	recently completed a multivolume set of laws and edicts, or fatwas. The 
	mufti is renowned for his fatwas, which, he said, he issues almost every day 
	when people come to him with questions about the application of religious 
	law. The mufti has also issued fatwas against the secular press when they 
	investigate the rise of militant Islam in Bangladesh. When he advocates 
	punishment for those who offend Islam, he said, he does not intend to preach 
	violence. The young men of Huji who attacked the poet Shamsur Rahman were 
	studying in one of his madrassas in Chittagong. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mufti said that the only reason 
	he is not a government minister is that the current regime snubbed him out 
	of fear as to how his appointment would look. The West would see both him 
	and Bangladesh as too extremist. The mufti has been named in Indian 
	intelligence documents as a member of the central committee of Huji (itself 
	linked to Al Qaeda), an association he would, of course, deny. He is also 
	rumored to have close friends among the Afghan Taliban, which he denies, 
	while adding that it's better not to discuss the Afghan Taliban, as they are 
	so frequently misunderstood. Besides, he says as the corner of his mouth 
	twitches into a smile, the Taliban are running all over his madrassa, as the 
	word ''talib'' means only student. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Outside his office, the sound of 
	boys' voices reciting the Koran rises and falls. Fifteen hundred students 
	study at the madrassa, and the mufti's party, the I.O.J., sponsors madrassas 
	all over the nation; how many, he claimed not to know. Financing, the mufti 
	said, comes mostly from Bangladesh itself, but some money also arrives from 
	friends throughout the Arab world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of all his political influence, the 
	mufti is most proud of his fatwas, which, he said, give him a means to speak 
	out against those who violate Islam. ''Whoever speaks against Islam, I issue 
	a fatwa against them to the government,'' he said. ''But the government says 
	nothing.'' He shook his head, frustrated. That's next on his agenda: to 
	pressure the government to recognize his religious injunctions. ''It's 
	possible,'' he said, ''now more than ever.'' </font></p>
